# ReactIE-PDF-Conversion
This is the PDF converter for ReactIE project. The program takes in a PDF of chemistry paper and outputs a json file containing all the text information, parsed into corresponding sections. See copper_acetate.txt as an example.

## Issues
- Currently designed to work well with The Journal of Organic Chemistry (lots of hardcode)
- Can't parse test2.xml into correct sections yet (next step)
