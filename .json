Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) was found to be an effective target for the treatment of PCa, but the research on its inhibitors is rather little. In this work, a potent DYRK2 inhibitor 43 (IC50 = 0.6 nM) was acquired through virtual screening and structural optimization, which displayed high selectivity among 205 kinases; meanwhile, detailed interactions of 43 with DYRK2 were illustrated by the cocrystal. Furthermore, 43 possessed great water solubility (29.5 mg/mL), favorable safety properties (LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg), and potent anti-PCa activities, which could be used as a potential candidate in further preclinical studies. INTRODUCTION Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major threat to male health, which has the second highest incidence and fifth mortality rate in male cancers worldwide.1,2 Nowadays, hormonal therapy plays a leading role in the treatment of PCa through decreasing androgens. However, most PCa patients will become resistant to hormonal therapy and progress to metastatic, hormone-resistant phase after a period of treatment.3,4 Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to develop a novel therapeutic method for PCa. Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) belong to the CMGC family and can be divided into class I (DYRK1A and DYRK1B) and class II (DYRK2, DYRK3, and DYRK4) groups.5,6 DYRK2, the most studied class II DYRK, was found to play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration.7-9 Meanwhile, DYRK2 was identified as a target for PCa, and downregulation of DYRK2 prominently inhibited PCa.10,11 However, few studies about DYRK2 inhibitors were reported, and most of the reported DYRK2 inhibitors are natural products or derivatives (Figure 1).12-14 Therefore, we focused on the development of novel DYRK2 inhibitors for the treatment of PCa. In this study, we obtained a lead DYRK2 inhibitor 14 through structure-based virtual screening, then conducted structural optimization to get the potent DYRK2 inhibitor 43 with an IC50 value of 0.6 nM, which also displayed high selectivity among 205 kinases. Meanwhile, we solved the cocrystal structure of 43 with DYRK2 protein to clarify their detailed interactions. Moreover, in vitro evaluation indicated that 43 significantly inhibited PCa cell proliferation and migration, obviously induced apoptosis, and possessed great water solubility (29.5 mg/mL). Further in vivo evaluation demonstrated that 43 owned excellent safety profiles (LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg) and showed potent antitumor activity for the PCa xenografts, which could be used as a potential candidate for future studies. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Discovery of the Lead of DYRK2 Inhibitors through Virtual Screening. To discover novel DYRK2 inhibitors, we used specs database and our in-house library to conduct virtual screening (Figure 2), and 189,103 ligands were retained after the elimination of compounds with poor drug-like properties. The remaining ligands were used to dock with DYRK2 protein (PDB: 7EJV) to conduct filtration.10 LibDock strategy was first A J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX employed,15 and 10,398 compounds (LibDock score \u2265 130) were retained. CDOEKER strategy was adopted to make further filtration,16 and 5983 compounds (-CDOCK ENERGY \u2265 20) were reserved and then clustered into 200 clusters. Subsequently, we chose 20 ligands from them to evaluate their DYRK2 inhibitory activity (Figure S1 and Table S1). The results showed that compound 14 displayed DYRK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 1474 nM. The binding model analysis of compound 14 with DYRK2 indicated that the secondary amine of 14 formed one hydrogen bond with Leu-231. Moreover, the scaffold of 14, including benzothiazole, pyrimidine, pyridine, and piperazine, formed many hydrophobic interactions with DYRK2 (Figure 3). Therefore, based on the binding model analysis, the scaffold of 14 was retained in the following structural optimization, which focused on the substituent groups on pyrimidine and piperazine and the linker between pyridine and piperazine. Chemistry. The piperazine intermediates were synthesized according to Scheme 1. Intermediates M3a-c were obtained via the reductive amination reaction in the presence of NaBH(OAc)3. Intermediates M6a-f and M9a-b were obtained through the condensation reaction in the condition of 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and HOBt/EDCI, respec-tively. Commercially available M10 condensated with N-substituent piperazine to generate M12a-b in the presence of HATU. Target compounds were synthesized according to Scheme 2. Commercially available 5-bromobenzo[d]thiazoleM13 reacted with bis(pinacolato)diboron to afford M14 in the presence of the Pd(dppf)Cl2 catalyst. M15a-d were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction of commercially available 2,4-dichloropyrimidine with different substituents and M14. The target compounds 14 and 21-49 were obtained through the Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction of M15a-d with appropriate N-substituent piperazine or one more removal of \u201cBoc\u201d step. Chemical Optimization and Structure-Activity Rela-tionship Studies. Based on the binding model analysis of lead compound 14 with DYRK2, the initial chemical optimization focused on the substituent groups on pyrimidine and piperazine. When the isopropyl substituent of piperazine was changed to the bulky \u201cBoc\u201d group (21, Table 1), the Figure 1. Representative natural products or derivatives as DYRK2 inhibitors. Figure 2.

XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX B DYRK2 inhibitory activity was significantly decreased. When isopropyl was changed to a small \u201cH\u201d group (22, Table 1), the DYRK2 inhibitory activity was also not improved. Then, the replacement of the methyl substituent of pyrimidine with methoxyl or hydrogen generated 23-26 (Table 1), and 24 and 26 bearing unsubstituted piperazine displayed slightly improved DYRK2 inhibitory activity. When pyrimidine was substituted with fluorine (27-29, Table 1), DYRK2 inhibitory activities of 27 and 29 that had small substituent groups on piperazine were further improved. Scheme 1.

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX D To further improve the DYRK2 inhibitory activity, the methylene linker between pyridine and piperazine was changed to carbonyl (30-43, Table 1). For 30-32, their DYRK2 inhibitory activities were indeed increased due to the introduction of the carbonyl linker when compared with 21 and 22. Especially, 31 even bearing the bulky \u201cBoc\u201d substituent of piperazine also exhibited the DYRK2 inhibitory activity (IC50 = 268 nM), but 21 also bearing the bulky \u201cBoc\u201d substituent did not exhibit the DYRK2 inhibitory activity (IC50 > 10,000 nM). When pyrimidine was substituted with hydrogen (33-36, Table 1), DYRK2 inhibitory activities were significantly improved, and 34 displayed a potent DYRK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 67 nM. For 27-29, the introduction of the fluorine substituent on pyrimidine improved DYRK2 inhibitory activities. Therefore, we also synthesize a series of compounds with the carbonyl linker and fluorine substituent (37-43, Table 1). 37 bearing the ethyl substituent of piperazine displayed a potent DYRK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 22 nM. Subsequently, the ethyl substituent of piperazine was changed to bigger groups, and these compounds (38-42) still retained potent inhibitory activities against DYRK2 but did not improve. To our great delight, when ethyl was replaced with hydrogen, the corresponding compound (43) exhibited strong inhibitory activities against DYRK2 (IC50 = 0.6 nM). After we obtained the potent DYRK2 inhibitor 43, we also conducted further structure-activity relationship studies. Pyridine was replaced with pyrimidine, and a series of compounds (44-46, Table 2) were synthesized. Compared with 37-43, the DYRK2 inhibitory activities of 44-46 were significantly decreased, which indicated the importance of pyridine in maintaining the DYRK2 inhibitory activity. Considering the function of pyridine, 47-49 (Table 2) bearing the pyridine moiety were synthesized, and the \u201cN\u201d position of pyridine was changed. 47-49 all displayed potent DYRK2 inhibitory activities. Similar to 43, 49 bearing unsubstituted piperazine also exhibited strong inhibitory activities against DYRK2 (IC50 = 4 nM). In summary, among all of these target compounds, compound 43 displayed the most potent DYRK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.6 nM, which was selected for further biological evaluation. Kinase Selectivity and Cocrystal Structure of Com-pound 43. To evaluate the selectivity of 43, the inhibitory activity of 43 at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM against a panel of 205 kinases was determined. As shown in Figure 4 and Table S2, 43 exhibited great selectivity among these 205 kinases. Especially, the inhibitory rate of 43 against more than 200 kinases is less than 70%. To clearly elucidate the interactions between 43 and DYRK2, the cocrystal structure of 43 with DYRK2 was successfully solved, the resolution of which was 2.8 \u00c5 (Table S3). The cocrystal structure indicated that the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2 protein was occupied by 43 (Figure 5A,B). Furthermore, Leu-231 played a significant role in the interactions between 43 and DYRK2, which formed hydrogen bond interactions with pyrimidine and the secondary amine of 43. The carbonyl linker also formed two hydrogen bonds with Asn-234 (Figure 5C), which provided a great explanation that the introduction of the carbonyl linker significantly improved the DYRK2 inhibitory activity. All of these interactions indicated that 43 closely bound to DYRK2. Compound 43 Exhibited Significant Anti-PCa Activity In Vitro. To thoroughly evaluate the anti-PCa activity of 43 in vitro, the experiments to test the effects of 43 on the cell growth, clone formation, and migration were conducted. Enzalutamide was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 and played a significant role in the treatment of PCa. Nowadays, enzalutamide has been used as the first-line treatment drug for PCa, which was chosen as the positive control in this work. The results indicated that 43 significantly suppressed the growth (Figures 6A-C and S2), clone formation (Figure 6D,E), and migration (Figure 6F,G) of DU145 and 22Rv1 cells. When the inhibitory activity against proliferation and migration of 43 was confirmed, flow cytometry was then used to detect the effects of 43 on the cell cycle and apoptosis in DU145 and 22Rv1 cells. The result indicated that 43 could block the cell cycle to G1 phase (Figures 6H,I and S3) and induced apoptosis (Figures 6J,K and S4) in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, 43 exhibited more potent efficacy in cell proliferation and migration inhibition and apoptosis induction than enzalutamide. Subsequently, western blot was used to detect the effects of 43 treatment on the key protein levels in the DU145 and 22Rv1 cells (Figure 6L,M). The 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) is a substrate of DYRK2 and can be phosphorylated by DYRK2.17,18 The results revealed that 43 showed a significant suppression on the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which demonstrated the targeting of 43 to DYRK2 and potent inhibitory activity of 43 against DYRK2 kinase activity. Considering the regulation of 43 on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, the level of these related proteins was also tested. The results indicated that 43 could reduce the expression of c-MYC and increase the level of P27, which was consistent with the antiproliferative activity of 43. Meanwhile, upregulation of E-cadherin, cleaved PRAP, and P53 also confirmed the effects of 43 on cell migration and apoptosis. In summary, 43 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis to reduce PCa burden. Compound 43 Displayed Excellent Safety Properties. After assessing the in vitro anti-PCa activity of 43, solubility and permeability assays of 43 were conducted (Table 3). The results indicated that 43 was easily soluble in water with the solubility of 29.5 mg/mL. In addition, the parallel artificial Table 2.

The QP log HERG value was -6.743, which indicated no inhibitory activity of 43 on the hERG channel (Table 3). Subsequently, acute toxicity experiments were conducted to evaluate the safety properties of 43. Mice were divided into a control group and four treatment groups, and the four treatment groups were orally administrated 43 once at doses of 1000, 2500, 5000, or 10,000 mg/kg. The results showed that the body weight of each group of mice increased normally (Figure 7A). Moreover, the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of mice were also weighed after execution, and the results showed that there was no weight difference of these main organs for five groups of mice (Figure 7B). To further evaluate the safety properties of 43, H&E staining experiments on the main organs of 5000 and 10,000 mg/kg group mice were conducted, and the results revealed no lesions of these organs (Figure 7C). In general, these results demonstrated excellent safety properties of 43. Figure 4. Inhibitory activity of compound 43 (1 \u03bcM) against a panel of 205 kinases. Figure 5.

After confirming the high safety profiles of 43, the DU145 xenograft model was used to evaluate the anti-PCa activity of 43 in vivo. As shown in Figure 8A-C, low dose of 43 (100 mg/kg) showed a significant inhibition on the growth of tumor in the xenograft; meanwhile, high dose of 43 (200 mg/ kg) exhibited more potent inhibitory activity against tumor growth. Moreover, a high dose of 43 showed a stronger suppression of tumor growth than the positive control enzalutamide (100 mg/kg). Moreover, there was no weight Figure 6.

XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX G difference in these four groups of mice, which also provided strong evidences of the great safety profiles of 43 (Figure 8D). The Ki67 staining revealed that 43 obviously suppressed the proliferation of cancer cells (Figure 8E). The western blot analysis of tumor tissues indicated that p-4E-BP1 and c-MYC proteins were downregulated, and P27, E-cadherin, cleaved PRAP, and P53 proteins were upregulated (Figure 8F), which were consistent with the effects of 43 treatment on the cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis-related proteins in vitro. In conclusion, 43 could significantly inhibit PCa tumor growth in vivo with no obvious toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS PCa is one of the most common male cancers worldwide, and DYRK2 inhibitors were found to display remarkable anti-PCa activity. However, there were not many reported DYRK2 inhibitors. Therefore, we paid attention to discover novel DYRK2 inhibitors. In the present study, a lead DYRK2 Figure 7. Compound 43 possessed excellent safety properties in vivo.

Meanwhile, the cocrystal structure disclosed accurate and strong interactions between 43 and DYRK2. Moreover, 43 showed great inhibitory activity against proliferation and migration and also obviously promoted apoptosis for PCa cells. 43 also exhibited favorable water solubility (29.5 mg/mL) and excellent safety properties (LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg). Furthermore, high dose of 43 showed more remarkable tumor growth inhibition than enzalutamide (100 mg/kg) in the PCa xenografts. In summary, 43 could be used as a potential candidate for future research of PCa treatment. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Structure-Based Virtual Screening.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common male cancerwith high incidence and mortality, and hormonal therapy as the major treatment for PCa patients is troubled by the inevitable resistance that makes us identify novel targets for PCa. Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) was found to be an effective target for the treatment of PCa, but the research on its inhibitors is rather little. In this work, a potent DYRK2 inhibitor 43 (IC50 = 0.6 nM) was acquired through virtual screening and structural optimization, which displayed high selectivity among 205 kinases; meanwhile, detailed interactions of 43 with DYRK2 were illustrated by the cocrystal. Furthermore, 43 possessed great water solubility (29.5 mg/mL), favorable safety properties (LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg), and potent anti-PCa activities, which could be used as a potential candidate in further preclinical studies.",
    "introduction": [
        "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major threat to male health, which has the second highest incidence and fifth mortality rate in male cancers worldwide.1,2 Nowadays, hormonal therapy plays a leading role in the treatment of PCa through decreasing androgens. However, most PCa patients will become resistant to hormonal therapy and progress to metastatic, hormone-resistant phase after a period of treatment.3,4 Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to develop a novel therapeutic method for PCa.",
        "Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) belong to the CMGC family and can be divided into class I (DYRK1A and DYRK1B) and class II (DYRK2, DYRK3, and DYRK4) groups.5,6 DYRK2, the most studied class II DYRK, was found to play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration.7-9 Meanwhile, DYRK2 was identified as a target for PCa, and downregulation of DYRK2 prominently inhibited PCa.10,11 However, few studies about DYRK2 inhibitors were reported, and most of the reported DYRK2 inhibitors are natural products or derivatives (Figure 1).12-14 Therefore, we focused on the development of novel DYRK2 inhibitors for the treatment of PCa.",
        "In this study, we obtained a lead DYRK2 inhibitor 14 through structure-based virtual screening, then conducted structural optimization to get the potent DYRK2 inhibitor 43 with an IC50 value of 0.6 nM, which also displayed high selectivity among 205 kinases. Meanwhile, we solved the cocrystal structure of 43 with DYRK2 protein to clarify their detailed interactions. Moreover, in vitro evaluation indicated that 43 significantly inhibited PCa cell proliferation and migration, obviously induced apoptosis, and possessed great water solubility (29.5 mg/mL). Further in vivo evaluation demonstrated that 43 owned excellent safety profiles (LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg) and showed potent antitumor activity for the PCa xenografts, which could be used as a potential candidate for future studies."

        "Discovery of the Lead of DYRK2 Inhibitors through Virtual Screening. To discover novel DYRK2 inhibitors, we used specs database and our in-house library to conduct virtual screening (Figure 2), and 189,103 ligands were retained after the elimination of compounds with poor drug-like properties. The remaining ligands were used to dock with DYRK2 protein (PDB: 7EJV) to conduct filtration.10 LibDock strategy was first A J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX employed,15 and 10,398 compounds (LibDock score \u2265 130) were retained. CDOEKER strategy was adopted to make further filtration,16 and 5983 compounds (-CDOCK ENERGY \u2265 20) were reserved and then clustered into 200 clusters. Subsequently, we chose 20 ligands from them to evaluate their DYRK2 inhibitory activity (Figure S1 and Table S1). The results showed that compound 14 displayed DYRK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 1474 nM.",
        "The binding model analysis of compound 14 with DYRK2 indicated that the secondary amine of 14 formed one hydrogen bond with Leu-231. Moreover, the scaffold of 14, including benzothiazole, pyrimidine, pyridine, and piperazine, formed many hydrophobic interactions with DYRK2 (Figure 3). Therefore, based on the binding model analysis, the scaffold of 14 was retained in the following structural optimization, which focused on the substituent groups on pyrimidine and piperazine and the linker between pyridine and piperazine.",
        "Chemistry. The piperazine intermediates were synthesized according to Scheme 1. Intermediates M3a-c were obtained via the reductive amination reaction in the presence of NaBH(OAc)3. Intermediates M6a-f and M9a-b were obtained through the condensation reaction in the condition of 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and HOBt/EDCI, respec-tively. Commercially available M10 condensated with N-substituent piperazine to generate M12a-b in the presence of HATU.",
        "Target compounds were synthesized according to Scheme 2. Commercially available 5-bromobenzo[d]thiazoleM13 reacted with bis(pinacolato)diboron to afford M14 in the presence of the Pd(dppf)Cl2 catalyst. M15a-d were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction of commercially available 2,4-dichloropyrimidine with different substituents and M14. The target compounds 14 and 21-49 were obtained through the Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction of M15a-d with appropriate N-substituent piperazine or one more removal of \u201cBoc\u201d step.",
        "Chemical Optimization and Structure-Activity Rela-tionship Studies. Based on the binding model analysis of lead compound 14 with DYRK2, the initial chemical optimization focused on the substituent groups on pyrimidine and piperazine. When the isopropyl substituent of piperazine was changed to the bulky \u201cBoc\u201d group (21, Table 1), the Figure 1. Representative natural products or derivatives as DYRK2 inhibitors. Figure 2.

XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX B DYRK2 inhibitory activity was significantly decreased. When isopropyl was changed to a small \u201cH\u201d group (22, Table 1), the DYRK2 inhibitory activity was also not improved. Then, the replacement of the methyl substituent of pyrimidine with methoxyl or hydrogen generated 23-26 (Table 1), and 24 and 26 bearing unsubstituted piperazine displayed slightly improved DYRK2 inhibitory activity. When pyrimidine was substituted with fluorine (27-29, Table 1), DYRK2 inhibitory activities of 27 and 29 that had small substituent groups on piperazine were further improved. Scheme 1.

        "To further improve the DYRK2 inhibitory activity, the methylene linker between pyridine and piperazine was changed to carbonyl (30-43, Table 1). For 30-32, their DYRK2 inhibitory activities were indeed increased due to the introduction of the carbonyl linker when compared with 21 and 22. Especially, 31 even bearing the bulky \u201cBoc\u201d substituent of piperazine also exhibited the DYRK2 inhibitory activity (IC50 = 268 nM), but 21 also bearing the bulky \u201cBoc\u201d substituent did not exhibit the DYRK2 inhibitory activity (IC50 > 10,000 nM). When pyrimidine was substituted with hydrogen (33-36, Table 1), DYRK2 inhibitory activities were significantly improved, and 34 displayed a potent DYRK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 67 nM.",
        "For 27-29, the introduction of the fluorine substituent on pyrimidine improved DYRK2 inhibitory activities. Therefore, we also synthesize a series of compounds with the carbonyl linker and fluorine substituent (37-43, Table 1). 37 bearing the ethyl substituent of piperazine displayed a potent DYRK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 22 nM. Subsequently, the ethyl substituent of piperazine was changed to bigger groups, and these compounds (38-42) still retained potent inhibitory activities against DYRK2 but did not improve. To our great delight, when ethyl was replaced with hydrogen, the corresponding compound (43) exhibited strong inhibitory activities against DYRK2 (IC50 = 0.6 nM).",
        "After we obtained the potent DYRK2 inhibitor 43, we also conducted further structure-activity relationship studies. Pyridine was replaced with pyrimidine, and a series of compounds (44-46, Table 2) were synthesized. Compared with 37-43, the DYRK2 inhibitory activities of 44-46 were significantly decreased, which indicated the importance of pyridine in maintaining the DYRK2 inhibitory activity. Considering the function of pyridine, 47-49 (Table 2) bearing the pyridine moiety were synthesized, and the \u201cN\u201d position of pyridine was changed. 47-49 all displayed potent DYRK2 inhibitory activities. Similar to 43, 49 bearing unsubstituted piperazine also exhibited strong inhibitory activities against DYRK2 (IC50 = 4 nM).",
        "In summary, among all of these target compounds, compound 43 displayed the most potent DYRK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.6 nM, which was selected for further biological evaluation.",
        "Kinase Selectivity and Cocrystal Structure of Com-pound 43. To evaluate the selectivity of 43, the inhibitory activity of 43 at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM against a panel of 205 kinases was determined. As shown in Figure 4 and Table S2, 43 exhibited great selectivity among these 205 kinases. Especially, the inhibitory rate of 43 against more than 200 kinases is less than 70%.",
        "To clearly elucidate the interactions between 43 and DYRK2, the cocrystal structure of 43 with DYRK2 was successfully solved, the resolution of which was 2.8 \u00c5 (Table S3). The cocrystal structure indicated that the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2 protein was occupied by 43 (Figure 5A,B). Furthermore, Leu-231 played a significant role in the interactions between 43 and DYRK2, which formed hydrogen bond interactions with pyrimidine and the secondary amine of 43. The carbonyl linker also formed two hydrogen bonds with Asn-234 (Figure 5C), which provided a great explanation that the introduction of the carbonyl linker significantly improved the DYRK2 inhibitory activity. All of these interactions indicated that 43 closely bound to DYRK2.",
        "Compound 43 Exhibited Significant Anti-PCa Activity In Vitro. To thoroughly evaluate the anti-PCa activity of 43 in vitro, the experiments to test the effects of 43 on the cell growth, clone formation, and migration were conducted. Enzalutamide was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 and played a significant role in the treatment of PCa. Nowadays, enzalutamide has been used as the first-line treatment drug for PCa, which was chosen as the positive control in this work.",
        "The results indicated that 43 significantly suppressed the growth (Figures 6A-C and S2), clone formation (Figure 6D,E), and migration (Figure 6F,G) of DU145 and 22Rv1 cells. When the inhibitory activity against proliferation and migration of 43 was confirmed, flow cytometry was then used to detect the effects of 43 on the cell cycle and apoptosis in DU145 and 22Rv1 cells. The result indicated that 43 could block the cell cycle to G1 phase (Figures 6H,I and S3) and induced apoptosis (Figures 6J,K and S4) in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, 43 exhibited more potent efficacy in cell proliferation and migration inhibition and apoptosis induction than enzalutamide.",
        "Subsequently, western blot was used to detect the effects of 43 treatment on the key protein levels in the DU145 and 22Rv1 cells (Figure 6L,M). The 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) is a substrate of DYRK2 and can be phosphorylated by DYRK2.17,18 The results revealed that 43 showed a significant suppression on the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which demonstrated the targeting of 43 to DYRK2 and potent inhibitory activity of 43 against DYRK2 kinase activity. Considering the regulation of 43 on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, the level of these related proteins was also tested. The results indicated that 43 could reduce the expression of c-MYC and increase the level of P27, which was consistent with the antiproliferative activity of 43. Meanwhile, upregulation of E-cadherin, cleaved PRAP, and P53 also confirmed the effects of 43 on cell migration and apoptosis. In summary, 43 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis to reduce PCa burden.",
        "Compound 43 Displayed Excellent Safety Properties. After assessing the in vitro anti-PCa activity of 43, solubility and permeability assays of 43 were conducted (Table 3). The results indicated that 43 was easily soluble in water with the solubility of 29.5 mg/mL. In addition, the parallel artificial Table 2.

The QP log HERG value was -6.743, which indicated no inhibitory activity of 43 on the hERG channel (Table 3).",
        "Subsequently, acute toxicity experiments were conducted to evaluate the safety properties of 43. Mice were divided into a control group and four treatment groups, and the four treatment groups were orally administrated 43 once at doses of 1000, 2500, 5000, or 10,000 mg/kg. The results showed that the body weight of each group of mice increased normally (Figure 7A). Moreover, the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of mice were also weighed after execution, and the results showed that there was no weight difference of these main organs for five groups of mice (Figure 7B). To further evaluate the safety properties of 43, H&E staining experiments on the main organs of 5000 and 10,000 mg/kg group mice were conducted, and the results revealed no lesions of these organs (Figure 7C). In general, these results demonstrated excellent safety properties of 43. Figure 4. Inhibitory activity of compound 43 (1 \u03bcM) against a panel of 205 kinases. Figure 5.

As shown in Figure 8A-C, low dose of 43 (100 mg/kg) showed a significant inhibition on the growth of tumor in the xenograft; meanwhile, high dose of 43 (200 mg/ kg) exhibited more potent inhibitory activity against tumor growth.

(C) Representative H&E staining photos of main organs from control, 5000 and 10,000 mg/kg group mice. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX H inhibitor 14 (IC50 = 1474 nM) was discovered through structure-based virtual screening, and then a potent DYRK2 inhibitor 43 (IC50 = 0.6 nM) was obtained through structural optimization, which exhibited high selectivity among a panel of 205 kinases. Meanwhile, the cocrystal structure disclosed accurate and strong interactions between 43 and DYRK2. Moreover, 43 showed great inhibitory activity against proliferation and migration and also obviously promoted apoptosis for PCa cells. 43 also exhibited favorable water solubility (29.5 mg/mL) and excellent safety properties (LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg). Furthermore, high dose of 43 showed more remarkable tumor growth inhibition than enzalutamide (100 mg/kg) in the PCa xenografts. In summary, 43 could be used as a potential candidate for future research of PCa treatment."
