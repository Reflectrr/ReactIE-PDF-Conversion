While synthetic methods for halogenation present selectivity and reactivity challenges, halogenases have evolved over time to perform selective reactions under benign conditions. The optimization of halogena-tion biocatalysts has utilized enzyme evolution and structure-based engineering alongside biotransfor-mation in a variety of systems to generate stable site-selective variants. The recent improvements in halogenase-catalyzed reactions has demonstrated the utility of these biocatalysts for industrial purposes, and their ability to achieve a broad substrate scope implies a synthetic tractability with increasing rele-vance in medicinal chemistry.

Introduction Enzymes have evolved to catalyze reactions with high efficiency and selectivity, and can overcome inherent chemical biases with complex substrates. Halogenation is particularly important in medicinal chemistry and drug design, and with the aid of biocata-lysts, chemists can implement efficient methods for halogenation that are environmentally benign. Since the discovery of halogenat-ing enzymes (halogenases), an effort has been made to engage their selective reactivity in syntheses of complex molecules such as natural products. Thus, the collective knowledge gained from the characterization of these enzymes has led to a major effort in halogenase discovery and engineering for biocatalyst develop-ment.1\u20134 This has included methodologies in structure-based engi-neering5,6 and directed evolution7 where biocatalysts with scalable capabilities8 have been generated. Additionally, halogenases have been implemented in vivo using various expression systems to optimize biotransformation of complex molecules. Most halogenases are currently grouped into four classes including 1) haloperoxidases (heme-containing and vanadium-containing), 2) iron (II)/2-(oxo)-glutarate (FeII/2OG)-dependent halogenases, 3) flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs), and 4) fluo-rinases. Haloperoxidases tend to be nonselective due to the freely diffusing hypohalous acid that acts as the halogenating agent, whereas FeII/2OG-dependent halogenases proceed through a radi-cal mechanism to halogenate aliphatic carbons on a variety of sub-strates. FDHs utilize hypohalous acid similarly to the haloperoxidases, but they implement a selectivity mechanism involving the formation of chloramine on a catalytic lysine in the enzyme active site.9 Enzymatic fluorination requires unique condi-tions that enable desolvation of the fluoride ion, which subse-quently performs a nucleophilic attack on the substrate. Numerous studies relating to the mechanism and function of FDHs have been reported, from which a foundation for halogenase engi-neering has been built. Recent studies have included the first appli-cation of computational chemistry to analyze the mechanism of FDH-catalyzed chlorination.10 Bioactive halogenated natural products and halogenating enzymes Many of the over 4,000 known halogenated natural products have therapeutic potential. The antitumor agent rebeccamycin,11 antibiotic vancomycin,12,13 and vasorelaxant mal-brancheamide14,15 are structurally complex compounds, and strategies toward their synthesis would benefit from new halo-genation methods (Fig. 1). The challenges involved in preparing these materials through synthetic methods have motivated researchers to investigate the biosynthetic machinery involved in the assembly and late-stage tailoring of these secondary metabo-lites. Current chemical halogenation methods are rarely selective and tend to involve the use of toxic reagents.

Sherman / Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 28 (2018) 1992\u20131999 1993 halogenase RebH has been extensively characterized9,16,17 and the wealth of biochemical information has been utilized toward enzyme engineering efforts. RebH binds tryptophan, a biosynthetic precursor, and catalyzes chlorination at the Trp C7 position prior to incorporation into the metabolite by additional biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 1a). The halogenase involved in vancomycin biosyn-thesis (VhaA) performs a late-stage dihalogenation of the carrier protein bound hexapeptide precursor prior to cyclization and offloading of the final product (Fig. 1b).18 Late-stage halogenation of complex molecules is particularly challenging, but tethering a substrate to a carrier protein presents its own biosynthetic demands. Numerous fungal FDHs that react with freestanding complex molecules have been identified,19\u201324 including MalA which is a late-stage halogenase involved in malbrancheamide biosynthesis (Fig. 1c).10 Chloramphenicol is a well-known antibi-otic that is chlorinated by the FDH CmlS, which bears a rare cova-lently bound flavin cofactor, and its biosynthetic halogenation remains under investigation.25\u201328 Molecular dissection has enabled engineering strategies directed toward improving stability, expanding substrate scope, and altering site-selectivity of FDHs. Halogenation and drug design One third of the drugs currently in clinical trials are halo-genated, which underscores the significance of methods for intro-ducing halogen atoms into pharmaceuticals.29 Halogens can aid in controlling metabolism and improving pharmacological properties such as lipophilicity and permeability. Additionally, the halogen functionality can facilitate target binding which was originally thought to be a consequence of electron-withdrawing and steric effects. More recently, investigators have begun studying the \u2018\u2018halogen bond\u201d and its utility in generating more selective thera-peutics.30 Due to the anisotropic nature of the halogen atom, a region of positive potential (sigma hole) can interact with a nega-tively charged region on the protein to form a halogen bond,31,32 the strength of which directly correlates with the size of the halo-gen itself. In fact, the strongest halogen bond (between iodine and a backbone carbonyl) is comparable in energy to the weakest hydrogen bond.33 Typically, halogen bonds have been observed either between the ligand halogen and aromatic amino acids or a backbone carbonyl.32 The interactions with aromatic side chains are considered either edge-on or face-on, where the halogen approaches the aromatic ring from the periphery (edge-on) or interacts directly with the center of the aromatic ring (face-on).29,30 Structural analysis of proteins bound to halogenated ligands has indicated that the edge-on interaction is more common and tends to involve phenylalanine and histidine side chains. In contrast, the face-on interaction frequently involves the side chains of tryptophan and tyrosine residues, potentially due to their higher p densities.30 When the halogen atom is attached to an aro-matic region of the ligand, these bond strengths are potentiated. The pharmacokinetic properties of drugs can be modulated by the insertion of a halogen substituent such as fluorine, which is commonly substituted for aromatic hydrogens that are prone to metabolism. In a study of N-benzylamide-based thrombin inhibi-tors, para substitution of fluorine showed the highest increase in potency presumably due to the decrease in metabolism.34 The halogen bond has also been utilized to facilitate the selective bind-ing of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs).29 Cl-p interac-tions between the cardiovascular therapeutics ticlopidine and amlodipine and CYP2B4 stabilize a conformation conducive to metabolism that is not observed when the molecules bind CYP2B6. The Cl-p interaction is not only significant for therapeutic targets, but it can also potentiate reactivity of some biosynthetic haloge-nases involved in producing halogenated natural products. Recent work that focused on the characterization of an iterative haloge-nase, MalA, found that a Cl-p interaction facilitated the binding 1994 A.E. Fraley, D.H. Sherman / Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 28 (2018) 1992\u20131999 of the monochlorinated ligands, leading to a higher catalytic effi-ciency for the second halogenation reaction (Fig. 2).10 Detailed mechanistic and structural analyses of halogenases have been instrumental in the development of these enzymes as biocatalysts. With insight into how these proteins work, engineering efforts have produced selective halogenases that perform chemical trans-formations on therapeutically relevant small molecules. Halogenase engineering Enzyme engineering has long been employed in efforts to pro-vide robust and selective biocatalysts for applications in synthetic chemistry. Engineering strategies have included directed evolu-tion35 as well as structure-guided protein engineering,5 both of which have been utilized to generate improved biocatalysts for halogenation. Directed evolution involves selecting a parent enzyme that performs a reaction of interest and randomly mutat-ing the polypeptide to produce a library of variants. In contrast, a structure-guided approach relies on knowledge of the protein structure and mechanism for rational selection of mutations that are predicted to alter the reactivity. Although unpredictable, direc-ted evolution has produced biocatalysts with increased thermosta-bility,36 varied substrate scope,37 and altered site-selectivity.7 Structure-guided engineering presents a more rational approach that can be used for well-characterized proteins. This strategy has produced biocatalysts with reactivity comparable to traditional synthetic methods for halogenation,8 as well as with improved reactivity38 and site-selectivity.5,6 A key difference between these two methods is that developing a hind-site rationale for enhance-ment in enzyme activity is often difficult for directed evolution. Enzyme stability and optimal activity In order to utilize biocatalysts for chemical transformations, the enzymes must be highly efficient. In principle, a more efficient bio-catalyst would exhibit both increased stability and higher reactiv-ity. Based on this concept, initial studies using directed evolution to develop a thermostable FDH provided a RebH variant with a melting temperature 18 NoneC higher and an optimal reaction temper-ature 5 NoneC higher than the wild-type enzyme.36 The thermostable RebH variant also had improved conversion and a longer half-life at higher reaction temperatures. At lower reaction temperatures, which were optimal for the wild-type enzyme, the catalytic effi-ciency of the variant was much lower than that of wild-type RebH. This work demonstrated that the stability of an enzyme is not necessarily a reflection of its activity. In this example, the 9 8Phe Catalytic Efficiency kcat/KmFirst chlorination: 12 min-1mM-1Second chlorination: 27 min-1mM-1Fig. 2. Cl-p interaction in MalA halogenase. The C9 chlorinated substrate is shown in blue (PDB ID: 5WGW) and the C8 chlorinated substrate is shown in yellow (PDB ID: 5WGZ). thermostable RebH variant may have been less active at physiological temperature due to constrained conformational flex-ibility.36 Flavin-dependent proteins in general have been reported to exhibit broad conformational flexibility between the oxidized and reduced cofactor bound forms. The reduced flavin cofactor is required for halogenase activity, and it has been supplemented into the system using a variety of methods,8,39 as described below. The use of FDHs as biocatalysts can be challenging due to the enzymatic systems required to generate the reduced flavin (FADH2) that is necessary for their activity. A nonspecific NAD(P) H-dependent flavin reductase (FR), such as RebF in rebeccamycin biosynthesis,16 often provides the FADH2 for these reactions. In the most efficient scenarios, the NAD(P)H is regenerated through a recycling system consisting of either glucose dehydrogenase39 or alcohol dehydrogenase (Fig. 3).8 One hypothesis is that bringing the enzymes in this system into close proximity would allow for a faster rate of cofactor exchange. Frese et al. immobilized these macromolecular components into aggregates and achieved gram-scale bromination of tryptophan by RebH.8 The aggregates could not only be reused up to ten times, but they were also amenable to storage for up to four months at 4 NoneC with no apparent decrease in activity. Immobilization of the enzyme components also stream-lined the purification of the brominated product. Moreover, in con-trast to in vivo bioconversion methods, chloride ion contamination could be avoided in the immobilized system, limiting the produc-tion of chlorinated molecules when bromination was desired. Rather than link all of the enzymes in the system together, Andorfer et al.40 applied a technique previously shown to be suc-cessful in generating productive P450/reductase fusion enzymes.41 The autologous FR was linked to RebH with the expectation that the increased local concentration of FADH2 would increase enzyme activity. While reductase activity was maintained, the kinetic parameters of the halogenation reaction for the fusion protein were diminished. When excess reductase was added to the reac-tion mixture, the halogenation catalyzed by the fusion protein increased, indicating that the FR must be present in a higher con-centration than the halogenase to provide adequate levels of FADH2 for efficient catalysis. When the halogenase and reductase Fig. 3. Flavin-dependent halogenase cofactor regeneration. A.E. Fraley, D.H. Sherman / Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 28 (2018) 1992\u20131999 1995 were present in a 1:1 ratio the activity was decreased in both the fusion and the standalone systems, indicating that the local con-centration of reductase in proximity to the halogenase was not pertinent to increasing the activity. While in vitro reactions of the fusion protein did not produce higher conversion rates, the in vivo fusion protein assays demonstrated higher conversion, which may have been due to the presence of an endogenous FR enhancing generation of the reduced cofactor. Cofactor regeneration can also be achieved by using an in vivo system for biotransformation. By expressing Trp 7-halogenase RebH and Trp 5-halogenase PyrH,42 alongside FR in Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), the incorporation of halogenated indole into various medicinally relevant alkaloids was observed (Fig. 4).43 The halogenated Trp was converted to the tryptamine precursor by the endogenous Trp-decarboxylase for the targeted indole alkaloid products. While wild-type C. roseus produced minor amounts of 19,20-dihydroakuammicine, the chlorinated analog 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine was produced in high quan-tities in the RebH/RebF16 variant, demonstrating the inherent flexibility of the downstream enzymes to accept the 7-chlorotryptamine precursor. A similar study where RebH and Trp-6-halogenase SttH44 were expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that the localization of the FDH/FR system to the chloro-plasts could aid cofactor regeneration.45 Localization of haloge-nases to the chloroplasts in the absence of exogenous FR led to comparable product formation indicating that the plastids provide a sufficient supply of reducing agents from native metabolic path-ways.46 The targeted coexpression of the Trp decarboxylase was required for production of halogenated tryptamine derivatives as the chloroplasts are devoid of this enzyme.

Structure-based halogenase engineering The halogenases involved in preparation of bioactive natural products are most synthetically useful when a clear understanding of their function has been determined. The first structure of the FDH PrnA47 led to a mechanistic proposal that continues to be refined, and initial attempts to modulate the selectivity of these enzymes were structure-based. In the case of PrnA, a structural analysis of substrate complexes led to the mutation of a phenylala-nine residue that appeared to interact directly with the indole ring of the tryptophan substrate.6 This mutation induced a shift in the site-selectivity of the chlorination and bromination reactions from solely C7-halogenation to both C7 and C5 due to differential sub-strate positioning near the chloramine adduct that the enzyme is thought to employ for selective halogenation.9 Further structure-based engineering of RebH resulted in a mutant form that preferentially accepted tryptamine over its native tryptophan substrate.48 The introduction of this mutant into C. roseus led to the selective chlorination of tryptamine and its incorporation into 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine. The in vivo biosynthetic applications of the chlorinated tryptamine pre-cursor included preparation of halogenated analogs of molecules with therapeutic potential (Fig. 4). The further utility of the trypta-mine-selective mutant in this system depended on the flexibility of the downstream biosynthetic machinery toward accepting the halogenated precursor. Rational engineering of halogenase func-tion has also been applied to the Trp 7-FDH PrnA and Trp 5-FDH PyrH.38 The substrate scope of these two halogenases was assessed on small molecules that were aromatic, but lacked the indole ring N H N O H C O O H N H C N O O H C l N H C l C N H O O N H N H 2 C O HO X Trp deca rb .

Sherman / Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 28 (2018) 1992\u20131999 present in tryptophan. A key substrate with more mobility in the active site, anthranilic acid, was selected to query engineered PrnA. Basic residues were substituted into the active site to coordinate the molecule and position it for selective halogenation. Single point mutations led to an increase in activity and selectivity between the para and ortho positions. By combining two of the most significant mutations, a large increase in activity was observed. X-ray crystal structures of the mutants displayed shifts in residues important for substrate binding, but the mechanism of altered selectivity remained ambiguous due to the lack of bound substrate in the structures. The structure of the first Trp 6-halogenase, SttH, guided rational engineering efforts toward more selective halogenation.5 The factors contributing to site-selective halogenation were deter-mined by comparing the structures of the Trp 7-halogenases (RebH and PrnA) and the Trp 5-halogenase PyrH to that of SttH (Fig. 5). A triple mutant was prepared by targeting residues in a region close to the core of the Trp substrate (L460, P461, and P462). Introduc-tion of these mutations tuned the selectivity of the Trp 6-haloge-nase, which was then able to chlorinate at the C5 position as well. Upon utilizing a substrate with more flexibility in the active site (3-indolepropionic acid), the SttH triple mutant produced pri-marily 5-chloro-3-indole-propionic acid. Alternatively, when the corresponding triple mutant of PyrH was produced in an attempt to shift its selectivity from the C5 to C6 position, the protein was inactive. This work provided a rational strategy for switching the site-selectivity of a FDH without decreasing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The observed differences between the different FDHs were exploited to design halogenation biocatalysts with tai-lored site-selectivity. This approach was applied to additional sub-strates and, combined with the immobilization methods of Frese et al.,8 demonstrated the synthetic utility of these biocatalysts on a preparative scale. A similar comparison of the crystal structures of the tetrahalo-genase Bmp2 and dihalogenase Mpy16 led to the identification of structural elements responsible for controlling the degree of pyr-role halogenation.49 A Bmp2 triple mutant with the corresponding residues from Mpy16 produced a monohalogenated product, indi-cating that the substrate may have been repositioned.

Residues 460\u2013462 of SttH were mutated to modulate the regioselectivity toward the Trp substrate. substitution in Mpy16 led to insoluble protein, thus the ability to shift the selectivity of FDHs may require modulation of amino acids outside the immediate vicinity of the substrate. Structure-based engineering efforts have also been imple-mented to change the type of C\u2013H functionalization reaction per-formed by an enzyme. After acquiring a detailed mechanistic understanding of FeII/2OG-dependent oxygenases and haloge-nases, an effort to convert an oxygenase to the latter was under-taken.50 FeII/2OG halogenases are members of the oxygenase family and are highly similar to related enzymes that catalyze hydroxylation reactions. Unlike FDHs, FeII/2OG-dependent haloge-nases perform chlorination or bromination reactions on aliphatic carbons through a radical-based mechanism. The structure of the halogenase WelO5 provided information about substrate binding that was critical to this engineering effort.51,52 The mechanism in both FeII/2OG-dependent oxygenases and halogenases proceeds through a ferryl (FeIV-O) intermediate, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, leaving behind a substrate carbon-cen-tered radical and FeIII-OH. In hydroxylases, the substrate radical reacts with the FeIII-OH species to yield a hydroxylated product. The iron coordination differs between hydroxylases, which utilize a carboxylate residue, and halogenases where this residue is sub-stituted with an alanine/glycine. In the latter, an additional coordi-nation site is open for a halide ion to bind and react with the substrate radical. With the aid of theWelO5 structure, it was deter-mined that in order for halogenation to occur, the substrate must be located away from the ferryl intermediate and in a conforma-tion unique to FeII/2OG-dependent halogenases. A hydroxylase with high structural similarity to WelO5 was identified and the FeII carboxylate ligand was mutated to glycine. With a structurally similar protein, it was hypothesized that the substrate would bind optimally for halogenation, and only the single amino acid substi-tution would be required for conversion to a halogenase. Both chlo-rinated and brominated products were acquired using this mutant, while some hydroxylation was still observed. This work provided a proof of concept that a thorough understanding of reaction mech-anism could be exploited to achieve a switch in reaction type. Directed evolution for engineered halogenases In contrast to structure-based protein engineering strategies, RebH has also been subjected to a thorough directed evolution campaign. The pioneering effort to stabilize the enzyme toward a more tractable biocatalyst led to an increased melting tempera-ture, and a more active enzyme.36 The substrate scope of the ther-mostable RebH was expanded, and the mutants were shown to chlorinate a variety of complex unnatural substrates.37 Previous structure-based work had demonstrated the ability of a RebH mutant (Y455W) to selectively halogenate tryptamine over trypto-phan.48 This idea was utilized in subsequent work where RebH was engineered for optimal activity on tryptamine (N470S) to facilitate the employment of a high-throughput screening strategy for assessing halogenation selectivity.7 The method involved assaying RebH mutants (generated through directed evolution) with 7-deu-terotryptamine to assess halogenation at alternative sites by mass spectrometry. Error-prone PCR was employed to generate a library of RebH mutants with excellent selectivity for chlorinating the C6-and C5-positions of the tryptamine indole ring. Mutations identi-fied from previous work were incorporated into the evolution pro-cess,36 and degenerate codons were utilized at sites that showed particular selectivity when varied. Although the process appears relatively straightforward, the system becamemore complex when the authors found that reverting some of the original mutations in the newer variants led to higher reactivity while maintaining selectivity. After preparation of the selective mutants, the authors attempted to rationalize the mechanism of selectivity through Fig. 6. Biosynthesis of fluorinated molecules. A.E. Fraley, D.H. Sherman / Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 28 (2018) 1992\u20131999 1997 docking models. For each mutant, the docking simulations pro-duced a variety of substrate poses, some of which were consistent with the observed selectivity. For the C7-and C5-selective haloge-nases, the docking results included poses that were highly similar to those found in the crystal structures of the Trp 7-halogenase RebH and Trp 5-halogenase PyrH substrate complexes. The engi-neered C6-halogenase provided mixed results, with no clear indi-cation of the mechanism of selectivity. Shortly after this work was performed, the first structure of a Trp 6-halogenase (SttH) was solved, further aiding this analysis.5 To expand the inquiry into FDH utility in synthetic approaches, a collaborative academic-industry partnership enabled a large sur-vey of substrate scope for a number of natural and engineered FDHs.53 The biocatalysts included wild-type RebH (Trp 7-haloge-nase), ThaI (Trp 6-halogenase), several engineered RebH mutants, and a set of marginally characterized fungal FDHs. The RebH mutants were selected based on previous work that identified enzymes exhibiting increased activity on nonnative substrates37,38 as well as altered site selectivity on tryptamine.7 Through this screen, the investigators determined that fungal FDHs preferen-tially halogenated substrates that were less nucleophilic than bac-terial Trp FDHs. Using computational methods, the authors predicted that there was a minimal electronic activation (HalA) required for halogenation by FDHs through the proposed elec-trophilic aromatic substitution. Accordingly, potential substrates could be more accurately predicted. In previous directed evolution studies with these proteins, it was observed that the electronic activation is not the only factor contributing to their site-selectiv-ity. Docking studies were useful for developing hypotheses regard-ing substrate binding, but developments using these methods were not always insightful. While a broad range of substrates were ana-lyzed in this work,53 FDH activity could only be correlated with the calculations of HalA and the key component of structural valida-tion remained to be analyzed. An interesting analysis was conducted between the chlorination reactions catalyzed by the FDHs compared to the common small-molecule reagent N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS).53 The halogenases mediated a site-selective reaction, whereas NCS typically produced mixtures of regioisomers. Additionally, the use of NCS sometimes led to dihalogenated molecules, which was not observed for the corresponding FDHs.16 The authors concluded that this was due to the decreased activity on halogenated substrates. Monohalo-genation has been uniquely overcome by the fungal FDH MalA which displayed a higher catalytic efficiency for the second of two chlorination reactions on the complex indole substrate pre-malbrancheamide.10 The surprising variation within this class of enzymes indicates that discovery of new FDHs will continue to broaden the repertoire of halogenating biocatalysts. Fig. 7. a) The mechanism of halide binding was demonstrated in crystal structures of the S. cattleya fluorinase with SAM and ClNone. The halide is proposed to be further coordinated by S158 to desolvate the FNone ion for fluorination activity (PDB ID: 2V7U). b) Product complex with 50-FDA. (PDB ID: 2V7V). Fluorination biocatalysts The elusive fluorinase is of particular interest in medicinal chemistry due to the frequent use of fluorine to improve potency and selectivity of pharmaceutical lead compounds. Fluorine is fre-quently substituted for hydrogen in therapeutic molecules during the development phase because it tends to maintain or enhance target binding. Fluorine can also effectively modulate the meta-bolic profile and pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule.34,54,55 Synthetic methods for fluorination represent a dis-crete focus of medicinal chemistry because of the challenges asso-ciated with fluoride ion desolvation. Without the use of harsh synthetic strategies, a fluorinase enzyme from Streptomyces catt-leya was found to produce the free FNone ion, which could perform a substitution reaction on S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to pro-duce 50-fluorodeoxyadenosine (50-FDA) and 4-fluoro-threonine.56\u201358 S. cattleya also produced fluoroacetate which could then be incorporated into therapeutically relevant natural products such as polyketides and steroids, via fluoromalonyl-CoA (Fig. 6).55 Novel fluorinated natural products have been produced through feeding fluorinated precursors into biosynthetic systems, as well as by genetically engineering fluorinases into the producing organism of interest.59 The fluorinase gene from S. cattleya was genetically incorporated into Salinospora tropica to produce a fluorinated sali-nosporamide A, which is a naturally chlorinated anticancer agent.59,60 These strategies are only favorable when the down-stream biosynthetic machinery can accommodate the fluorinated intermediates. In the S. tropica system, endogenous enzymes were found to prefer the natural chlorinated substrates over the unnat-ural fluorinated molecules, and a disruption of the chlorinase gene was generated for optimal fluorine incorporation. Following dis-covery of the first fluorinase, an in silico genome mining effort was conducted to identify four additional enzymes within this family.61,62 The fluorinase from S. cattleya has also been used in the prepa-ration of 18F-labeled imaging reagents for medical applications.63,64 Biocatalytic fluorination presents a significant advancement in 18F chemistry because this radioisotope is usually prepared using a cyclotron with [18O]-H2O, leaving the final 18FNone ion in aqueous con-ditions that are not suitable for the subsequent chemistry.65 Fluo-rinase-catalyzed functionalization can utilize the 18FNone ion under aqueous conditions efficiently without having to deviate from ambient temperature and neutral pH. In an application of biocat-alytic 18F fluorination, a fluorinase was paired with a nucleoside hydrolase to produce 5-[18F]-fluoro-5-deoxyribose which was then used in tumor imaging.63 Initial efforts to engineer fluorinase enzymes started with a comparison of the chlorinase in S. tropica to the fluorinase in 1998 A.E. Fraley, D.H. Sherman / Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 28 (2018) 1992\u20131999 S. cattleya which have 35% amino acid identity. Upon comparison of the halide ion binding site, an attempt was made to convert the chlorinase to a fluorinase by substituting the respective halide-binding residues.57,66 Structural67,68 and computational studies69 of the fluorinase and chlorinase provided insights into the mechanism of halide selection. Crystal structures of the fluori-nase in complex with chloride ion (since FNone is indistinguishable from water) showed that the halide coordination is reliant on S158 and T80 in the fluorinase which are substituted with G131 and Y70 in the chlorinase, respectively (Fig. 7).56,58,67 Although, unsuccessful, this endeavor provided evidence that the halide binding site was not the only mechanism of halide selec-tivity. In recent advances in biocatalytic fluorination, more com-plex analogs of the traditional 50-FDA were prepared through late-stage fluorination of C2-substituted molecules, including those bearing click-chemistry handles.66,70 One shortcoming of biocatalysis is that enzymes tend to exhibit reduced catalytic effi-ciency with unnatural substrates, which has been observed in the previously discussed halogenases, and fluorinases are no excep-tion. Saturation mutagenesis was used to generate more active mutants, while reaction conditions such as temperature and leav-ing group options on the substrate were optimized.70 Further understanding of the molecular determinants of substrate speci-ficity based on the work of Sun et al. led to an expanded substrate scope and higher reactivity on unnatural substrates.66 The field of fluorine chemistry has benefited greatly from advances in fluorina-tion biocatalysis, adding to the significance of biohalogenation as a whole. Conclusions Halogenases have been engineered to perform a variety of reac-tions on molecules relevant to medicinal chemistry and drug development. Enzyme engineering efforts have produced haloge-nases with greater stability and reactivity bringing the field closer to industrial applicability. The work toward plant-based systems for in vivo halogenation of small molecules has succeeded in bring-ing the complexity of the system (including cofactors and multiple accessory proteins) down to a practical level. This has also been realized through the use of cross-linked enzyme aggregates and fusion proteins that produced a more viable system for large-scale catalysis. As biocatalytic halogenation systems become more robust and scalable, they will become increasingly attractive to academic, medicinal, and process chemists working on drug devel-opment as well as total syntheses.

        "Halogenation is commonly used in medicinal chemistry to improve the potency of pharmaceutical leads. While synthetic methods for halogenation present selectivity and reactivity challenges, halogenases have evolved over time to perform selective reactions under benign conditions. The optimization of halogena-tion biocatalysts has utilized enzyme evolution and structure-based engineering alongside biotransfor-mation in a variety of systems to generate stable site-selective variants. The recent improvements in halogenase-catalyzed reactions has demonstrated the utility of these biocatalysts for industrial purposes, and their ability to achieve a broad substrate scope implies a synthetic tractability with increasing rele-vance in medicinal chemistry.",

        "Introduction",
        "Enzymes have evolved to catalyze reactions with high efficiency and selectivity, and can overcome inherent chemical biases with complex substrates. Halogenation is particularly important in medicinal chemistry and drug design, and with the aid of biocata-lysts, chemists can implement efficient methods for halogenation that are environmentally benign. Since the discovery of halogenat-ing enzymes (halogenases), an effort has been made to engage their selective reactivity in syntheses of complex molecules such as natural products. Thus, the collective knowledge gained from the characterization of these enzymes has led to a major effort in halogenase discovery and engineering for biocatalyst develop-ment.1\u20134 This has included methodologies in structure-based engi-neering5,6 and directed evolution7 where biocatalysts with scalable capabilities8 have been generated. Additionally, halogenases have been implemented in vivo using various expression systems to optimize biotransformation of complex molecules.",
        "Most halogenases are currently grouped into four classes including 1) haloperoxidases (heme-containing and vanadium-containing), 2) iron (II)/2-(oxo)-glutarate (FeII/2OG)-dependent halogenases, 3) flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs), and 4) fluo-rinases. Haloperoxidases tend to be nonselective due to the freely diffusing hypohalous acid that acts as the halogenating agent, whereas FeII/2OG-dependent halogenases proceed through a radi-cal mechanism to halogenate aliphatic carbons on a variety of sub-strates. FDHs utilize hypohalous acid similarly to the haloperoxidases, but they implement a selectivity mechanism involving the formation of chloramine on a catalytic lysine in the enzyme active site.9 Enzymatic fluorination requires unique condi-tions that enable desolvation of the fluoride ion, which subse-quently performs a nucleophilic attack on the substrate. Numerous studies relating to the mechanism and function of FDHs have been reported, from which a foundation for halogenase engi-neering has been built. Recent studies have included the first appli-cation of computational chemistry to analyze the mechanism of FDH-catalyzed chlorination.10",
        "Bioactive halogenated natural products and halogenating enzymes",
        "Many of the over 4,000 known halogenated natural products have therapeutic potential. The antitumor agent rebeccamycin,11 antibiotic vancomycin,12,13 and vasorelaxant mal-brancheamide14,15 are structurally complex compounds, and strategies toward their synthesis would benefit from new halo-genation methods (Fig. 1). The challenges involved in preparing these materials through synthetic methods have motivated researchers to investigate the biosynthetic machinery involved in the assembly and late-stage tailoring of these secondary metabo-lites. Current chemical halogenation methods are rarely selective and tend to involve the use of toxic reagents. The rebeccamycin",

        "halogenase RebH has been extensively characterized9,16,17 and the wealth of biochemical information has been utilized toward enzyme engineering efforts. RebH binds tryptophan, a biosynthetic precursor, and catalyzes chlorination at the Trp C7 position prior to incorporation into the metabolite by additional biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 1a). The halogenase involved in vancomycin biosyn-thesis (VhaA) performs a late-stage dihalogenation of the carrier protein bound hexapeptide precursor prior to cyclization and offloading of the final product (Fig. 1b).18 Late-stage halogenation of complex molecules is particularly challenging, but tethering a substrate to a carrier protein presents its own biosynthetic demands. Numerous fungal FDHs that react with freestanding complex molecules have been identified,19\u201324 including MalA which is a late-stage halogenase involved in malbrancheamide biosynthesis (Fig. 1c).10 Chloramphenicol is a well-known antibi-otic that is chlorinated by the FDH CmlS, which bears a rare cova-lently bound flavin cofactor, and its biosynthetic halogenation remains under investigation.25\u201328 Molecular dissection has enabled engineering strategies directed toward improving stability, expanding substrate scope, and altering site-selectivity of FDHs.",

In fact, the strongest halogen bond (between iodine and a backbone carbonyl) is comparable in energy to the weakest hydrogen bond.33 Typically, halogen bonds have been observed either between the ligand halogen and aromatic amino acids or a backbone carbonyl.32 The interactions with aromatic side chains are considered either edge-on or face-on, where the halogen approaches the aromatic ring from the periphery (edge-on) or interacts directly with the center of the aromatic ring (face-on).29,30 Structural analysis of proteins bound to halogenated ligands has indicated that the edge-on interaction is more common and tends to involve phenylalanine and histidine side chains. In contrast, the face-on interaction frequently involves the side chains of tryptophan and tyrosine residues, potentially due to their higher p densities.30 When the halogen atom is attached to an aro-matic region of the ligand, these bond strengths are potentiated. The pharmacokinetic properties of drugs can be modulated by",

Directed evolution involves selecting a parent enzyme that performs a reaction of interest and randomly mutat-ing the polypeptide to produce a library of variants. In contrast, a structure-guided approach relies on knowledge of the protein structure and mechanism for rational selection of mutations that are predicted to alter the reactivity. Although unpredictable, direc-ted evolution has produced biocatalysts with increased thermosta-bility,36 varied substrate scope,37 and altered site-selectivity.7 Structure-guided engineering presents a more rational approach that can be used for well-characterized proteins. This strategy has produced biocatalysts with reactivity comparable to traditional synthetic methods for halogenation,8 as well as with improved reactivity38 and site-selectivity.5,6 A key difference between these two methods is that developing a hind-site rationale for enhance-ment in enzyme activity is often difficult for directed evolution.",

A nonspecific NAD(P) H-dependent flavin reductase (FR), such as RebF in rebeccamycin biosynthesis,16 often provides the FADH2 for these reactions. In the most efficient scenarios, the NAD(P)H is regenerated through a recycling system consisting of either glucose dehydrogenase39 or alcohol dehydrogenase (Fig. 3).8 One hypothesis is that bringing the enzymes in this system into close proximity would allow for a faster rate of cofactor exchange. Frese et al. immobilized these macromolecular components into aggregates and achieved gram-scale bromination of tryptophan by RebH.8 The aggregates could not only be reused up to ten times, but they were also amenable to storage for up to four months at 4 NoneC with no apparent decrease in activity.

While reductase activity was maintained, the kinetic parameters of the halogenation reaction for the fusion protein were diminished.

While wild-type C. roseus produced minor amounts of 19,20-dihydroakuammicine, the chlorinated analog 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine was produced in high quan-tities in the RebH/RebF16 variant, demonstrating the inherent flexibility of the downstream enzymes to accept the 7-chlorotryptamine precursor. A similar study where RebH and Trp-6-halogenase SttH44 were expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that the localization of the FDH/FR system to the chloro-plasts could aid cofactor regeneration.45 Localization of haloge-nases to the chloroplasts in the absence of exogenous FR led to comparable product formation indicating that the plastids provide a sufficient supply of reducing agents from native metabolic path-ways.46 The targeted coexpression of the Trp decarboxylase was required for production of halogenated tryptamine derivatives as the chloroplasts are devoid of this enzyme.

In the case of PrnA, a structural analysis of substrate complexes led to the mutation of a phenylala-nine residue that appeared to interact directly with the indole ring of the tryptophan substrate.6 This mutation induced a shift in the site-selectivity of the chlorination and bromination reactions from solely C7-halogenation to both C7 and C5 due to differential sub-strate positioning near the chloramine adduct that the enzyme is thought to employ for selective halogenation.9 Further structure-based engineering of RebH resulted in a",

Basic residues were substituted into the active site to coordinate the molecule and position it for selective halogenation. Single point mutations led to an increase in activity and selectivity between the para and ortho positions. By combining two of the most significant mutations, a large increase in activity was observed. X-ray crystal structures of the mutants displayed shifts in residues important for substrate binding, but the mechanism of altered selectivity remained ambiguous due to the lack of bound substrate in the structures. The structure of the first Trp 6-halogenase, SttH, guided rational engineering efforts toward more selective halogenation.5 The factors contributing to site-selective halogenation were deter-mined by comparing the structures of the Trp 7-halogenases (RebH and PrnA) and the Trp 5-halogenase PyrH to that of SttH (Fig. 5). A triple mutant was prepared by targeting residues in a region close to the core of the Trp substrate (L460, P461, and P462). Introduc-tion of these mutations tuned the selectivity of the Trp 6-haloge-nase, which was then able to chlorinate at the C5 position as well. Upon utilizing a substrate with more flexibility in the active site (3-indolepropionic acid), the SttH triple mutant produced pri-marily 5-chloro-3-indole-propionic acid. Alternatively, when the corresponding triple mutant of PyrH was produced in an attempt to shift its selectivity from the C5 to C6 position, the protein was inactive. This work provided a rational strategy for switching the site-selectivity of a FDH without decreasing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.

        "Structure-based engineering efforts have also been imple-mented to change the type of C\u2013H functionalization reaction per-formed by an enzyme. After acquiring a detailed mechanistic understanding of FeII/2OG-dependent oxygenases and haloge-nases, an effort to convert an oxygenase to the latter was under-taken.50 FeII/2OG halogenases are members of the oxygenase family and are highly similar to related enzymes that catalyze hydroxylation reactions. Unlike FDHs, FeII/2OG-dependent haloge-nases perform chlorination or bromination reactions on aliphatic carbons through a radical-based mechanism. The structure of the halogenase WelO5 provided information about substrate binding that was critical to this engineering effort.51,52 The mechanism in both FeII/2OG-dependent oxygenases and halogenases proceeds through a ferryl (FeIV-O) intermediate, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, leaving behind a substrate carbon-cen-tered radical and FeIII-OH. In hydroxylases, the substrate radical reacts with the FeIII-OH species to yield a hydroxylated product. The iron coordination differs between hydroxylases, which utilize a carboxylate residue, and halogenases where this residue is sub-stituted with an alanine/glycine. In the latter, an additional coordi-nation site is open for a halide ion to bind and react with the substrate radical. With the aid of theWelO5 structure, it was deter-mined that in order for halogenation to occur, the substrate must be located away from the ferryl intermediate and in a conforma-tion unique to FeII/2OG-dependent halogenases. A hydroxylase with high structural similarity to WelO5 was identified and the FeII carboxylate ligand was mutated to glycine. With a structurally similar protein, it was hypothesized that the substrate would bind optimally for halogenation, and only the single amino acid substi-tution would be required for conversion to a halogenase. Both chlo-rinated and brominated products were acquired using this mutant, while some hydroxylation was still observed. This work provided a proof of concept that a thorough understanding of reaction mech-anism could be exploited to achieve a switch in reaction type.",

Error-prone PCR was employed to generate a library of RebH mutants with excellent selectivity for chlorinating the C6-and C5-positions of the tryptamine indole ring. Mutations identi-fied from previous work were incorporated into the evolution pro-cess,36 and degenerate codons were utilized at sites that showed particular selectivity when varied. Although the process appears relatively straightforward, the system becamemore complex when the authors found that reverting some of the original mutations in the newer variants led to higher reactivity while maintaining selectivity.

The RebH mutants were selected based on previous work that identified enzymes exhibiting increased activity on nonnative substrates37,38 as well as altered site selectivity on tryptamine.7 Through this screen, the investigators determined that fungal FDHs preferen-tially halogenated substrates that were less nucleophilic than bac-terial Trp FDHs. Using computational methods, the authors predicted that there was a minimal electronic activation (HalA) required for halogenation by FDHs through the proposed elec-trophilic aromatic substitution. Accordingly, potential substrates could be more accurately predicted. In previous directed evolution studies with these proteins, it was observed that the electronic activation is not the only factor contributing to their site-selectiv-ity. Docking studies were useful for developing hypotheses regard-ing substrate binding, but developments using these methods were not always insightful. While a broad range of substrates were ana-lyzed in this work,53 FDH activity could only be correlated with the calculations of HalA and the key component of structural valida-tion remained to be analyzed. An interesting analysis was conducted between the chlorination",

Additionally, the use of NCS sometimes led to dihalogenated molecules, which was not observed for the corresponding FDHs.16 The authors concluded that this was due to the decreased activity on halogenated substrates. Monohalo-genation has been uniquely overcome by the fungal FDH MalA which displayed a higher catalytic efficiency for the second of two chlorination reactions on the complex indole substrate pre-malbrancheamide.10 The surprising variation within this class of enzymes indicates that discovery of new FDHs will continue to broaden the repertoire of halogenating biocatalysts.",
