Petsko, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, and approved June 28, 2010 (received for review May 13, 2010) The CurA halogenase (Hal) catalyzes a cryptic chlorination leading to cyclopropane ring formation in the synthesis of the natural pro-duct curacin A. Hal belongs to a family of enzymes that use Fe2\u00fe, O2 and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) to perform a variety of halogenation reactions in natural product biosynthesis. Crystal structures of the enzyme in five ligand states reveal strikingly different open and closed conformations dependent on \u03b1KG binding. The open form represents ligand-free enzyme, preventing substrate from en-tering the active site until both \u03b1KG and chloride are bound, while the closed form represents the holoenzyme with \u03b1KG and chloride coordinated to iron. Candidate amino acid residues involved in sub-strate recognition were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. These new structures provide direct evidence of a conformational switch driven by \u03b1KG leading to chlorination of an early pathway intermediate. cryptic chlorination \u2223 natural products \u2223 polyketide synthases The nonheme Fe2\u00fe-and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG)-dependentenzymes couple the oxidative decarboxylation of \u03b1KG to for-mation of an activated iron-oxygen species that catalyzes a variety of transformations including hydroxylation, desaturation, ring-closure and ring-expansion. Recently a subfamily of Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases has been characterized that catalyze the chemically challenging halogenation of aliphatic C atoms (1, 2). These Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases function within assem-bly lines of two types of biosynthetic pathway. The polyketide synthases (PKS) and the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) produce natural products of astounding chemical diver-sity. While a number of natural products bear halogen atoms, others use cryptic halogenation en route to other chemical end points. The multicomponent, modular PKSs and NRPSs function by sequentially modifying a growing polyketide/peptide chain as it passes from one module to another. Intermediates are tethered via thioester linkage to the phosphopantetheine arms of acyl car-rier protein (ACP) domains in PKSs and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains in NRPSs. Curacin A, from the marine cyanobac-terium Lyngbya majuscula, is an unusual natural product with a cyclopropane ring, a thiazoline ring, an internal cis double bond, and a terminal alkene (3). The natural product exhibits antimi-totic activity and inhibits the binding of colchicine to tubulin (4, 5). The 65-kbp cur gene cluster encodes a hybrid PKS-NRPS (6). An 8-kbp region within cur has strikingly high sequence identity to a region of the jamaicamaide (jam) gene cluster from a distinct strain of L. majuscula (7). The amino acid sequence identity span-ning across CurA to CurF compared end-to-end with JamE to JamJ is 57%\u201393%. Embedded within the CurA and JamE PKS modules are catalytic domains with 92% sequence identity that were predicted to be Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases (2). Recently we established the role and timing of the curacin halogenase (Cur Hal) in the biosynthesis of curacin A. Hal was shown to be an Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenase that acted spe-cifically on 3-S-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-ACP ((S)-HMG-ACP) (Fig. 1A) (8). The chlorinated product reacted sequentially with the CurE ECH1 dehydratase, the CurF ECH2 decarboxylase, and the CurF enoylreductase (ER). Following ECH1\u2215ECH2-coupled dehydration and decarboxylation of 4-Cl-(S)-HMG-ACP, CurF ER catalyzed formation of the cyclopropane ring by nucleophilic displacement of chloride (8) on the ACP-bound substrate. As opposed to cyclopropane ring formation, the homo-logous JamE Hal, JamI ECH1, and JamJ ECH2 enzymes gener-ated a vinyl chloride functional group as the endpoint of the reaction series (8). Some insights into the catalytic mechanism of Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases came from crystal structures of the halo-genases SyrB2, which converts threonine to 4-chlorothreonine in the biosynthesis of syringomycin E (9, 10) and CytC3, which dou-bly chlorinates 2-aminobutyric acid (11, 12). In the iron coordi-nation sphere of these halogenases, a chloride ligand replaced the Glu or Asp ligand found in the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases (9, 11). Halogenation was shown to follow a similar mechanism to the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases (13). Following dioxygen-catalyzed decarboxylation of \u03b1KG, a reactive O \u00bc Fe4\u00fe inter-mediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond of the substrate, yielding a Fe3\u00fe-OH and a substrate radical (13, 14). The substrate radical is halogenated by \u201crebound\u201d of the chlorine atom, similar to rebound of hydroxyl in the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent hydroxylases. Recently, it was shown for the halogenase SyrB2 that substrate binding triggers formation of the reactive O \u00bc Fe4\u00fe intermediate and that hydroxylated products can be formed from alternative substrates (15, 16). Here we describe the structure of Cur Hal in five distinct ligand states. The four crystal structures demonstrate a remark-able conformational transition between open and closed states that is triggered by \u03b1KG binding. A large \u201clid\u201d covers the active site in closed-form Hal. Other concerted changes in the structure appear designed to exclude (S)-HMG-ACP from the active site of open-form Hal and to admit it to the closed form. Site-directed mutagenesis provides new insights about the basis for (S)-HMG specificity. Results Overall Structure.

The crystal-lized protein included residues 1600\u20131919 of CurA, here desig-nated 1\u2013320. The CurAHal domain possesses the cupin fold (17), a barrel-like structure consisting of a major antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21, \u03b26, \u03b24, \u03b28, \u03b23, and \u03b22) and a minor \u03b2-sheet (\u03b25 and \u03b27) (Fig. 1B). The cupin barrel houses the active site and is sur-rounded by helices. Like other Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent enzymes, Hal possesses a large flexible active-site lid (residues 40\u201366), which varies from fully ordered to fully disordered among the four crystal structures. Hal is a dimer in solution and in all of the four crystal structures, consistent with the dimeric architec-ture of PKS modules (Fig. S1). Helices \u03b15, \u03b17, and \u03b18 form the hydrophobic dimer interface, which is relatively small (940 \u00c52 buried surface area per monomer). Each active site is self-con-tained within a monomer. The two iron centers are 37 \u00c5 apart in the Hal dimer. The Hal domain was originally annotated as a phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase (PhyH) based on sequence similarity to the oxyge-nases (6). Indeed, Hal is most similar in structure to human PhyH (18), although only about two-thirds of Hal residues have struc-tural equivalents in PhyH (PDB 2A1X, rmsd of 3.1 \u00c5 for the C\u03b1 atoms of 205 residues with 16% sequence identity). Hal is also similar to the two characterized nonheme Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases, which are closely related to each other (58% iden-tity): SyrB2 in the syringomycin biosynthetic pathway (9) (2FCT; 3.3-\u00c5 rmsd, 216 residues, 13% identity) and CytC3 in the armen-tomycin pathway (11) (3GJB; 3.6-\u00c5 rmsd, 198 residues, 16% identity). Hal, PhyH, SyrB2, and CytC3 share a common cupin core with nearly identical active sites. In contrast, the outer helices, connecting loops, and active-site lid of Hal differ consid-erably from those of the other structures, in accord with the low 13%\u201316% sequence identities. Active Site. The Hal active site is characteristic of Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halogenases, and is captured in five distinct ligand states in the four crystal structures (Table S1 and Fig. 2, Fig. S2). The nonheme mononuclear iron center has an octahe-dral coordination shell with only two protein ligands, His115 and His228 (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2). Hal was crystallized under aerobic conditions, so the iron is assumed to be in the ferric state.

Structure and function of Cur Hal. (A) On-assembly-line chlorination in cyclopropane ring formation. The Hal domain within CurA specifically chlor-inates (S)-HMG-ACP at C4. The chlorinated product subsequently undergoes dehydration (CurE ECH1), decarboxylation (CurF ECH2), and cyclopropane ring formation (CurF ER).

(B) Open and closed forms of Cur Hal. In this stereo diagram the open and the closed subunits of Hal are superposed. In the closed-form subunit (cyan), an ordered 27-residue lid (red) covers the active site and the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop (dark blue) is at the periphery. In the open form (yellow), the lid (residues 40\u201365) is missing, and the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop (magenta) is adjacent to the active site and to a 310-like helix preceding \u03b14. Structural changes include shifts of \u03b23 and helices \u03b12, \u03b14, \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b19, and \u03b110, which were excluded from the superposition calcula-tion (rmsd \u00bc 0.9 \u00c5 for 217 C\u03b1 atoms). In the metal center (shown in sticks), iron (orange) coordinates two histidine side chains (cyan C), \u03b1KG (gray C), chloride (green) and formate (white C).

Halogenase structures containing \u03b1KG also have a chloride iron ligand (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2B), as in the SyrB2 and CytC3 enzymes (9, 11). In crystal form II, a formate ion from the crystallization solution occupies the sixth coordination posi-tion (Fig. 2A), where water is thought to bind in the resting en-zyme and dioxygen during catalysis. Water occupies this position in subunits containing Fe3\u00fe and no formate (Fig. 2C, Fig. S2B). Two crystal forms lack iron (Fig. 2B, Fig. S2C). In one of these, a formate ion occupies part of the \u03b1KG site (Fig. 2B). Both \u03b1KG and chloride form specific interactions with Cur Hal (Fig. 2A). The chloride ion is hydrogen bonded to the Ser120 hydroxyl and to water. \u03b1KG is fully buried in the enzyme in a largely hydrophobic pocket. At the bottom of the pocket, the \u03b1KG carboxylate distal to the Fe center (C5 carboxylate) is an-chored by four hydrogen bonds from the side chains of Trp134, Ser230, and Arg241. The key ionic contact of both C5-carboxylate oxygens with Arg241 is conserved in the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases/oxygenases. At the Fe-proximal end of \u03b1KG, the Arg247 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the C1 carboxy-late. This ionic contact is also conserved, but the position of the basic residue (Arg247 on strand \u03b28 in Hal) is not. A stacking interaction with Phe103 stabilizes an extended conformation of \u03b1KG. Several other residues (Phe222, Leu112, Met148, and Val245) contact \u03b1KG and contribute to the hydrophobic charac-ter of the binding site (Fig. 2A). \u03b1KG Binding Triggers a Conformational Switch. The structures pro-vide four views of the Hal subunit in a closed conformation and three in an open conformation (Table S1). The open and closed forms differ by a remarkable set of concerted changes in several parts of the structure (Fig. 1B). The most dramatic difference is an order-disorder transition of a 27-residue lid (40\u201366, red in Fig. 1B), which covers the active site in the closed form and is completely disordered in the open form. In addition, radically different structures also exist for the loop connecting helices \u03b19 and \u03b110 (residues 274\u2013284) (magenta and dark blue in Fig. 1B). Finally, several secondary structures are in slightly dif-ferent positions, including strand \u03b23 and helices \u03b12, \u03b14, \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b19, and \u03b110. These structural differences clearly distinguish two states of the enzyme. The individual subunits of each form are identical within experimental error (0.2 \u00c5\u20130.5 \u00c5 rmsd for C\u03b1 atom superposition) whereas the open and closed forms differ (1.5 \u00c5 rmsd). It is evident that the open and closed forms are not peculiarities of crystallization conditions or iron binding sta-tus, as each form occurred both with and without bound iron and in two unrelated crystals grown in different conditions. The open and closed forms occur together in the mixed-form dimer in crys-tal form III, attesting to the independence of the active sites. The structures reveal that the physiological switch between open and closed Cur Hal is \u03b1KG binding. All Hal subunits with a ligand in the \u03b1KG site are in the closed form and all subunits lacking a ligand in this site are in the open form. The key inter-action in the switch is the salt bridge between \u03b1KG and Arg241 (Fig. 2D). Movement of Arg241 appears to trigger the overall conformational change between closed and open Hal. Upon de-parture of the \u03b1KG C5-carboxylate from the bottom of the bind-ing pocket, the Arg241 side chain (strand \u03b28) swings out of the binding pocket into space occupied by Val105 on the adjacent strand \u03b23. Strand \u03b23 shifts 3 \u00c5 toward helices \u03b12 and \u03b14. Strand \u03b22 becomes disordered. Helices \u03b12 and \u03b14 shift slightly, repacking the hydrophobic core between \u03b12/\u03b14 and \u03b23/\u03b28. The shift of helix \u03b14 is incompatible with the position of the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop, which folds into the active site. The restructured \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop is incom-patible with helix \u03b13, which becomes disordered as the active-site lid (residues 40\u201366) opens. The flexible active-site lid comprises all residues between \u03b12 and \u03b14, including helix \u03b13 (residues 48\u201355) and strand \u03b22 (residues 64\u201368). Strand \u03b22 and residues 61\u201363 of the \u03b13\u2013\u03b22 loop cover the hydrophobic \u03b1KG binding pocket, and the pocket is solvent exposed when the lid opens. Both forms of the Cur Hal subunit are stabilized by specific interactions (Fig. 2D). In addition to the steric effects at Arg241 that drive the switch, four parts of the protein structure converge to form a set of specific interactions in open-form Hal, including formation of a 310-like helix (residues 68\u201377) following helix \u03b14, formation of a 310 helix (residues 278\u2013282) in the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop, and ionic interactions of the Asp69, His99, Arg247, and Asp283 side chains. In the closed-to-open transition, Tyr68 in the 310-like helix moves 17 \u00c5 out of the active site (Fig. 2D). Asp283 in the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop moves 12 \u00c5 toward the active site where it forms a salt bridge with the Arg247 side chain, which has moved 5 \u00c5 out of the active site. His99 (strand \u03b23) swings 7 \u00c5 away from the active site to hydrogen bond with Asp69 in the 310-like helix. Substrate Binding and Catalysis.

The dioxygen position is occupied by a formate ion in the form II crystal structure (Fig. 2A). In this structure, the active-site lid (residues 40\u201366) is fully ordered throughout its length and the active site is inaccessible to (S)-HMG-ACP. However, in the closed subunit of the form III crystal structure, residues 48\u201359 including lid helix \u03b13 are disordered while resi-dues 60\u201366 are secured over bound \u03b1KG. Substrate access to the active site is presumably through the opening created by disorder of lid helix \u03b13 in closed-form Hal. We modeled the (S)-HMG-thioester into the active site of closed-form Cur Hal (excluding lid residues 48\u201359) so that the HMG C4 atom was near both the Cl-ligand and the ferryl-oxo O atom (Fig. 4A). Hal is highly specific for its substrate, requiring both the S-hydroxyl group at C3 and the C5-carboxylate (8). In the model, the S-hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the Ser120 side chain, which forms a hydrogen bond with Cl-in struc-tures containing \u03b1KG (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2B). The Tyr68 side chain is hydrogen bonded to the substrate thioester carbonyl. No candidate residues for recognition of the HMG carboxylate are obvious in the core of the active site. However, lid helix \u03b13 includes several basic side chains, which may recognize the (S)-HMG carboxylate. Residues that may be important for substrate recognition were probed by alanine replacement or conservative substitution (Fig. 4 and Table S2). These residues include three basic and two polar residues that may recognize (S)-HMG-ACP (Leu112, Lys48, Lys50, Lys54, Ser44, and Tyr68), and four active-site resi-dues that directly or indirectly contact \u03b1KG or chloride (Ser120, Ser132, Arg241, and Arg247). Production of 4-Cl-HMG-ACP from (S)-HMG-ACP was monitored by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS), including a phosphopantetheine (PPant)-ejection assay (19), which releases Cl-HMG-PPant from Cl-HMG-ACP (8). Catalytic efficiency was monitored by the relative abundance of Cl-HMG-PPant and HMG-PPant, which differ in m\u2215z by 34 units (Fig. 4B and Figs. S3, S4, and S5).

Hal mechanism and role for conformational change. The resting enzyme (upper left) is in the open form and (S)-HMG-ACP is excluded. \u03b1KG and Cl-binding trigger the switch to the closed form, to which (S)-HMG-ACP can bind. Substrate binding permits dioxygen to coordinate the Fe2\u00fe, and triggers oxidative decarboxylation of \u03b1KG and formation of the chloro-oxo-ferryl intermediate. The intermediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, and the substrate radical is resolved by chlorination via a \u201crebound\u201d mechanism (13).

Under our assay conditions, wild-type Hal converted about 80% of HMG-ACP to the chlorinated product (Fig. 4 B, C). As expected, substitutions for residues that anchor \u03b1KG in the active site (Arg241, Arg247) resulted in a Hal variant with no detectable activity (Fig. 4C). Ala replacement of Ser120, which is hydrogen bonded to Cl-, also abolished activity, as did the Ala substitution at Ser132, which is connected to the active site indirectly through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2A, Fig. 4C). A conser-vative substitution at Leu112 did not alter activity, whereas sub-stitutions in the active-site lid substantially diminished activity. The largest effects (greater than tenfold) were observed for the basic residues Lys50 and Lys54, and for Tyr68. The mutagen-esis data are consistent with a role in (S)-HMG (or PPant) recog-nition for Lys50, Lsy54, and Tyr68, although no single residue was essential for catalysis. The greater than tenfold effect of conservative Phe substitution for Tyr68 suggests a critical hydro-gen-bonding interaction for this side chain. The effects of the Lys48 and Ser44 substitutions were five-and sixfold, respectively, consistent with an indirect effect on catalysis, for example by altering the dynamics of the active-site lid. Discussion The structure of CurA Hal is the third for a halogenase from the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halogenase family. The structures of Hal in five ligand states (apo, Fe3\u00fe/\u03b1KG/Cl-/ formate, Fe3\u00fe/\u03b1KG/Cl-, formate, Fig. 2 and Fig. S2) provide new pictures of the active site. Together with site-directed muta-genesis results (Fig. 4) the structures are relevant to the catalytic cycle and mechanism of Hal (Fig. 3) (13, 15) and two distantly related halogenases, SyrB2 and CytC3, which have active sites nearly identical to the Cur Hal active site (9, 11). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a critical role for Ser132. This result was unexpected because Ser132 is in the center of strand \u03b24 where the Ala substitution should not alter the back-bone conformation (Fig. 4A). However, in closed-form Hal, a hydrogen bond of the Ser132 side chain helps position the Arg247 guanidinium plane to interact with \u03b1KG in the active site (Fig. 2A). The loss of activity in Ser132Ala implies that Arg247 guanidinium positioning is critical to catalysis. We suggest that the Ser-Arg pair may assist in the departure of CO2 during for-mation of succinate and the chloro-oxo-ferryl intermediate (Fig. 3). This hydrogen bond may be a general feature of the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases as the hydrogen-bonding net-work to \u03b1KG is conserved in SyrB2 and CytC3, but with a Thr/Arg pair in place of Ser/Arg. Remarkably, the new structures reveal that Cur Hal exists in two conformations and that \u03b1KG triggers a switch between these forms (Fig. 2D). We designated the forms \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d because the active-site lid (residues 40\u201365) is completely disor-dered in the open form.Anopen active site is essential to substrate access, however open-form Hal is not simply a relaxed version of the closed form nor is it equivalent to the closed form with a dis-ordered active-site lid. Rather, the open and closed forms are characterized by distinct positions for several helices and loops, stabilized by different sets of hydrogen bonds. Open-form Hal has a total of 10 more hydrogen bonds than does the closed form (excluding the 40\u201365 lid), suggesting that the open form has an important function beyond exposing the active site. The additional hydrogen bonds in open-form Hal are in the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop and the adjacent \u03b14 helix N terminus. Arg247 is a key element of the conformational transition because it is hydrogen bonded to \u03b1KG in the closed form and in the open form has two hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate of Asp283 at the N terminus of helix \u03b110, as well as a hydrogen bond with the Ser120 carbonyl oxygen. Large conformational changes triggered by \u03b1KG have not been observed for other members of the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halogenase family, although there are few reports of companion structures with both occupied and empty \u03b1KG sites. Examples include the structures of a cephalosporin synthase (20) and an alkylsulfatase (21), in which \u03b1KG binding is accommo-dated by strictly local conformational changes relative to the free enzymes. The chemical structure of HMG may explain the need for two conformations of Hal. HMG is unusual and perhaps unique among substrates of Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halo-genases in that the reactive carbon (C4, Fig. 1A) has a carboxylate substituent (C5). The proximal carboxylate is an enormous com-plication for an Fe-dependent enzyme because only two of six coordination positions are occupied by protein ligands, the four nonprotein ligands turn over in each catalytic cycle, and the sub-strate carboxylate is not a ligand. Thus, it is critical for Hal to keep the HMG carboxylate out of the Fe2\u00fe coordination sphere, perhaps by excluding (S)-HMG-ACP altogether until the halo-genase active site is assembled by Fe2\u00fe coordination of \u03b1KG and Cl-. In open-form Hal, the active site appears able to accom-modate a carboxylate at any unoccupied position in the Fe ligand sphere. Indeed, in family members that are not halogenases, a carboxylate side chain coordinates Fe at the position of Cl-in Hal and the other halogenases (17). We propose that the purpose of a specific open form of Hal is to prevent (S)-HMG-ACP from entering the active site until both \u03b1KG and Cl-are bound (Fig. 4). In this manner, the interactions of the 310-like helix preceding \u03b14, the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop, and Arg247 create a barrier to (S)-HMG-ACP in open-form Hal. Hal has exquisite specificity for its substrate, (S)-HMG-ACP, requiring both the C3 S-hydroxyl group and the C5 carboxylate (8). Specificity for the C5 carboxylate is consistent with the need to engage the carboxylate with the protein and not with the Fe2\u00fe center. We assume that Hal has little specificity for the C3 R-methyl group because the 92%-identical halogenase from the jamaicamide PKS (7) accommodates a C3 R-substituent with a five-carbon chain. The exquisite substrate specificity is consistent with our finding that several residues on the active-site lid are critical to activity (Figs. 3 and 4A. Ala substitution for Lys50, Lys54, and Tyr68 resulted in more than tenfold reduction in activity in our assay conditions. Lys50 and Lys54 are thus can-didates to recognize the HMG carboxyl group. The Tyr68 hydro-xyl may hydrogen bond with the substrate thioester carbonyl oxygen, consistent with the finding that even a conservative substitution of Tyr with Phe resulted in more than tenfold loss of activity. In the core of Hal, Ala substitution for Ser120, which is hydrogen bonded to Cl-, abolished activity. The chloride hy-drogen bond is not required for halogenation because neither SyrB2 nor CytC3 has a direct hydrogen bond from protein to Cl-or a hydrogen-bonding side chain at the analogous position to Ser120. We suggest that the Ser120 side chain recognizes the C3 S-hydroxyl of HMG. In open-form Hal, the proposed sub-strate-recognition residues are otherwise occupied: Tyr68 is dis-placed 17 \u00c5 away from the active site; access to the Ser120 side chain is blocked by a hydrogen bond from the Arg247 side chain to the Ser carbonyl oxygen; and Lys50 and Lys54 are disordered. A highly reactive oxo-ferryl (O \u00bc Fe4\u00fe) intermediate forms when dioxygen binds to the iron center and decarboxylates \u03b1KG (Fig. 3). An event of \u201csubstrate triggering\u201d was proposed to explain how the Fe2\u00fe\u2215\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halogenases prevent formation of this reactive intermediate until the substrate is positioned (22). Substrate triggering has been observed in the SyrB2 halogenase (15), and is likely to occur in Hal as well. Thus, the substitutions at Lys50, Lys54, Tyr68, and Ser120 may prevent substrate triggering of chloro-oxo-ferryl formation in addition to any direct effects on HMG binding. The exquisite substrate selectivity of Hal is strikingly different from the situation of the SyrB2 halogenase, which formed halogenated, hydroxylated, or mixed products when presented with molecules similar to its natural substrate (16). In contrast to these results, we observed no hydroxylation products in Khare et al. PNAS \u2223 August 10, 2010 \u2223 vol. 107 \u2223 no. 32 \u2223 14103 BI O CH EM IS TR Y D ow nl oa de d fr om  http s: //w w w .p na s. or g by  Uni ve rs ity  of Il lin oi s on  Jun e 1,  202 2 fr om  IP ad dr es s 12 8. 17 4. 12 4. 13 0. FTICR-MS nor in the PPant-ejection assay of Hal activity (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3). A conundrum of Fe2\u00fe\u2215\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases is how the enzymes resolve the substrate free radical exclusively by halogenation because both chloride and hydroxyl ligands are available at the iron center (Fig. 3). The results with SyrB2 were interpreted as evidence that the halogenation vs. hydroxylation outcome depends on substrate positioning, which was thought to vary with the chemical structure of the SyrB2 substrate (16). The possibility of a hydroxylated product from a differently positioned substrate is relevant to Hal function because the en-zyme may encounter molecules that are chemically similar to (S)-HMG-ACP (8). Hal is followed in the curacin pathway by a dehydratase and a decarboxylase. We showed previously that these enzymes can act sequentially on HMG-ACP, i.e., preceding the Hal reaction (23). If the HMG-ACP dehydration product (C2-C3 alkene) or the subsequent decarboxylation product were able to bind in the Hal active site, incorrect hydroxylated products may result. Because the ACP that carries these substrates is fused to Hal (Fig. 1A), it is critical that any dehydrated and/or decarboxylated products be unable to access the Hal active site. Thus, the exquisite substrate selectivity serves as a barrier to the competing hydroxylation reaction. The combined requirements that Hal prevent Fe coordination of the HMG C5 carboxylate, allow dioxygen reaction at the appropriate moment, and exclude inappropriate substrates from the active site may have led to both the \u03b1KG trigger for transition to a substrate-accessible state, the substrate trigger to admit dioxygen, and the exquisite substrate selectivity of Cur Hal. Methods CurA Hal and the site-directedmutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Diffraction data were collected at beamline 23ID at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The structure of crystal form I was solved by a 2.6 \u00c5 single wavelength anom-alous diffraction dataset. Crystal form II, III, and IV were solved by molecular replacement using the model from crystal form I. Conversion of (S)-HMG-ACP substrate to Cl-(S)-HMG-ACP was analyzed by FTICR-MS and an infrared mul-tiphoton dissociation (IRMPD)-based phosphopantatheine (PPant) ejection assay (8, 19). Detailed methods are available in the SI Text. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank Dr. D. L. Akey for helpful discussions, Dr. T. C.

Petsko, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, and approved June 28, 2010 (received for review May 13, 2010) The CurA halogenase (Hal) catalyzes a cryptic chlorination leading to cyclopropane ring formation in the synthesis of the natural pro-duct curacin A. Hal belongs to a family of enzymes that use Fe2\u00fe, O2 and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) to perform a variety of halogenation reactions in natural product biosynthesis. Crystal structures of the enzyme in five ligand states reveal strikingly different open and closed conformations dependent on \u03b1KG binding. The open form represents ligand-free enzyme, preventing substrate from en-tering the active site until both \u03b1KG and chloride are bound, while the closed form represents the holoenzyme with \u03b1KG and chloride coordinated to iron. Candidate amino acid residues involved in sub-strate recognition were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. These new structures provide direct evidence of a conformational switch driven by \u03b1KG leading to chlorination of an early pathway intermediate. cryptic chlorination \u2223 natural products \u2223 polyketide synthases",

        "mation of an activated iron-oxygen species that catalyzes a variety of transformations including hydroxylation, desaturation, ring-closure and ring-expansion. Recently a subfamily of Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases has been characterized that catalyze the chemically challenging halogenation of aliphatic C atoms (1, 2). These Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases function within assem-bly lines of two types of biosynthetic pathway. The polyketide synthases (PKS) and the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) produce natural products of astounding chemical diver-sity. While a number of natural products bear halogen atoms, others use cryptic halogenation en route to other chemical end points. The multicomponent, modular PKSs and NRPSs function by sequentially modifying a growing polyketide/peptide chain as it passes from one module to another. Intermediates are tethered via thioester linkage to the phosphopantetheine arms of acyl car-rier protein (ACP) domains in PKSs and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains in NRPSs. Curacin A, from the marine cyanobac-terium Lyngbya majuscula, is an unusual natural product with a cyclopropane ring, a thiazoline ring, an internal cis double bond, and a terminal alkene (3). The natural product exhibits antimi-totic activity and inhibits the binding of colchicine to tubulin (4, 5). The 65-kbp cur gene cluster encodes a hybrid PKS-NRPS (6). An 8-kbp region within cur has strikingly high sequence identity to a region of the jamaicamaide (jam) gene cluster from a distinct strain of L. majuscula (7). The amino acid sequence identity span-ning across CurA to CurF compared end-to-end with JamE to JamJ is 57%\u201393%. Embedded within the CurA and JamE PKS modules are catalytic domains with 92% sequence identity that were predicted to be Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases (2). Recently we established the role and timing of the curacin halogenase (Cur Hal) in the biosynthesis of curacin A. Hal was shown to be an Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenase that acted spe-cifically on 3-S-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-ACP ((S)-HMG-ACP) (Fig. 1A) (8). The chlorinated product reacted sequentially with",
        "the CurE ECH1 dehydratase, the CurF ECH2 decarboxylase, and the CurF enoylreductase (ER). Following ECH1\u2215ECH2-coupled dehydration and decarboxylation of 4-Cl-(S)-HMG-ACP, CurF ER catalyzed formation of the cyclopropane ring by nucleophilic displacement of chloride (8) on the ACP-bound substrate. As opposed to cyclopropane ring formation, the homo-logous JamE Hal, JamI ECH1, and JamJ ECH2 enzymes gener-ated a vinyl chloride functional group as the endpoint of the reaction series (8).",
        "Some insights into the catalytic mechanism of Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases came from crystal structures of the halo-genases SyrB2, which converts threonine to 4-chlorothreonine in the biosynthesis of syringomycin E (9, 10) and CytC3, which dou-bly chlorinates 2-aminobutyric acid (11, 12). In the iron coordi-nation sphere of these halogenases, a chloride ligand replaced the Glu or Asp ligand found in the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases (9, 11). Halogenation was shown to follow a similar mechanism to the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases (13). Following dioxygen-catalyzed decarboxylation of \u03b1KG, a reactive O \u00bc Fe4\u00fe inter-mediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C-H bond of the substrate, yielding a Fe3\u00fe-OH and a substrate radical (13, 14). The substrate radical is halogenated by \u201crebound\u201d of the chlorine atom, similar to rebound of hydroxyl in the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent hydroxylases. Recently, it was shown for the halogenase SyrB2 that substrate binding triggers formation of the reactive O \u00bc Fe4\u00fe intermediate and that hydroxylated products can be formed from alternative substrates (15, 16).",
        "Here we describe the structure of Cur Hal in five distinct ligand states.

        "in two distinct conformations, which we designate \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed,\u201d and in several ligand states (Fig. 1B and 2). The crystal-lized protein included residues 1600\u20131919 of CurA, here desig-nated 1\u2013320. The CurAHal domain possesses the cupin fold (17), a barrel-like structure consisting of a major antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21, \u03b26, \u03b24, \u03b28, \u03b23, and \u03b22) and a minor \u03b2-sheet (\u03b25 and \u03b27) (Fig. 1B). The cupin barrel houses the active site and is sur-rounded by helices. Like other Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent enzymes, Hal possesses a large flexible active-site lid (residues 40\u201366), which varies from fully ordered to fully disordered among the four crystal structures. Hal is a dimer in solution and in all of the four crystal structures, consistent with the dimeric architec-ture of PKS modules (Fig. S1). Helices \u03b15, \u03b17, and \u03b18 form the hydrophobic dimer interface, which is relatively small (940 \u00c52 buried surface area per monomer). Each active site is self-con-tained within a monomer. The two iron centers are 37 \u00c5 apart in the Hal dimer. The Hal domain was originally annotated as a phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase (PhyH) based on sequence similarity to the oxyge-nases (6). Indeed, Hal is most similar in structure to human PhyH (18), although only about two-thirds of Hal residues have struc-",
        "tural equivalents in PhyH (PDB 2A1X, rmsd of 3.1 \u00c5 for the C\u03b1 atoms of 205 residues with 16% sequence identity). Hal is also similar to the two characterized nonheme Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases, which are closely related to each other (58% iden-tity): SyrB2 in the syringomycin biosynthetic pathway (9) (2FCT; 3.3-\u00c5 rmsd, 216 residues, 13% identity) and CytC3 in the armen-tomycin pathway (11) (3GJB; 3.6-\u00c5 rmsd, 198 residues, 16% identity). Hal, PhyH, SyrB2, and CytC3 share a common cupin core with nearly identical active sites. In contrast, the outer helices, connecting loops, and active-site lid of Hal differ consid-erably from those of the other structures, in accord with the low 13%\u201316% sequence identities. Active Site. The Hal active site is characteristic of Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halogenases, and is captured in five distinct ligand states in the four crystal structures (Table S1 and Fig. 2, Fig. S2). The nonheme mononuclear iron center has an octahe-dral coordination shell with only two protein ligands, His115 and His228 (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2). Hal was crystallized under aerobic conditions, so the iron is assumed to be in the ferric state. The cosubstrate, \u03b1KG, is a bidentate Fe3\u00fe ligand via the C2 ketone",

The chlorinated product subsequently undergoes dehydration (CurE ECH1), decarboxylation (CurF ECH2), and cyclopropane ring formation (CurF ER). Catalytic and carrier domains within Cur polypeptides are rendered as blocks (A, adenylation domain; AT, acyltransferase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; Cy, condensation/cyclization domain; DH, dehydratase; GNATL, GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase-like domain with bifunctional decarboxylase/S-acet-yltransferase activity; HCS, HMG-ACP synthase; KS, ketosynthase; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein). (B) Open and closed forms of Cur Hal. In this stereo diagram the open and the closed subunits of Hal are superposed. In the closed-form subunit (cyan), an ordered 27-residue lid (red) covers the active site and the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop (dark blue) is at the periphery. In the open form (yellow), the lid (residues 40\u201365) is missing, and the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop (magenta) is adjacent to the active site and to a 310-like helix preceding \u03b14.

        "and C1 carboxylate. Halogenase structures containing \u03b1KG also have a chloride iron ligand (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2B), as in the SyrB2 and CytC3 enzymes (9, 11). In crystal form II, a formate ion from the crystallization solution occupies the sixth coordination posi-tion (Fig. 2A), where water is thought to bind in the resting en-zyme and dioxygen during catalysis. Water occupies this position in subunits containing Fe3\u00fe and no formate (Fig. 2C, Fig. S2B). Two crystal forms lack iron (Fig. 2B, Fig. S2C). In one of these, a formate ion occupies part of the \u03b1KG site (Fig. 2B). Both \u03b1KG and chloride form specific interactions with Cur Hal (Fig. 2A). The chloride ion is hydrogen bonded to the Ser120 hydroxyl and to water. \u03b1KG is fully buried in the enzyme in a largely hydrophobic pocket. At the bottom of the pocket, the \u03b1KG carboxylate distal to the Fe center (C5 carboxylate) is an-chored by four hydrogen bonds from the side chains of Trp134, Ser230, and Arg241. The key ionic contact of both C5-carboxylate oxygens with Arg241 is conserved in the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases/oxygenases. At the Fe-proximal end of \u03b1KG, the Arg247 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the C1 carboxy-",
        "late. This ionic contact is also conserved, but the position of the basic residue (Arg247 on strand \u03b28 in Hal) is not. A stacking interaction with Phe103 stabilizes an extended conformation of \u03b1KG. Several other residues (Phe222, Leu112, Met148, and Val245) contact \u03b1KG and contribute to the hydrophobic charac-ter of the binding site (Fig. 2A). \u03b1KG Binding Triggers a Conformational Switch. The structures pro-vide four views of the Hal subunit in a closed conformation and three in an open conformation (Table S1). The open and closed forms differ by a remarkable set of concerted changes in several parts of the structure (Fig. 1B). The most dramatic difference is an order-disorder transition of a 27-residue lid (40\u201366, red in Fig. 1B), which covers the active site in the closed form and is completely disordered in the open form. In addition, radically different structures also exist for the loop connecting helices \u03b19 and \u03b110 (residues 274\u2013284) (magenta and dark blue in Fig. 1B). Finally, several secondary structures are in slightly dif-ferent positions, including strand \u03b23 and helices \u03b12, \u03b14, \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b19, and \u03b110. These structural differences clearly distinguish two states of the enzyme. The individual subunits of each form are identical within experimental error (0.2 \u00c5\u20130.5 \u00c5 rmsd for C\u03b1 atom superposition) whereas the open and closed forms differ (1.5 \u00c5 rmsd). It is evident that the open and closed forms are not peculiarities of crystallization conditions or iron binding sta-tus, as each form occurred both with and without bound iron and in two unrelated crystals grown in different conditions. The open and closed forms occur together in the mixed-form dimer in crys-tal form III, attesting to the independence of the active sites.",
        "The structures reveal that the physiological switch between open and closed Cur Hal is \u03b1KG binding. All Hal subunits with a ligand in the \u03b1KG site are in the closed form and all subunits lacking a ligand in this site are in the open form. The key inter-action in the switch is the salt bridge between \u03b1KG and Arg241 (Fig. 2D). Movement of Arg241 appears to trigger the overall conformational change between closed and open Hal. Upon de-parture of the \u03b1KG C5-carboxylate from the bottom of the bind-ing pocket, the Arg241 side chain (strand \u03b28) swings out of the binding pocket into space occupied by Val105 on the adjacent strand \u03b23. Strand \u03b23 shifts 3 \u00c5 toward helices \u03b12 and \u03b14. Strand \u03b22 becomes disordered. Helices \u03b12 and \u03b14 shift slightly, repacking the hydrophobic core between \u03b12/\u03b14 and \u03b23/\u03b28. The shift of helix \u03b14 is incompatible with the position of the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop, which folds into the active site. The restructured \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop is incom-patible with helix \u03b13, which becomes disordered as the active-site lid (residues 40\u201366) opens. The flexible active-site lid comprises all residues between \u03b12 and \u03b14, including helix \u03b13 (residues 48\u201355) and strand \u03b22 (residues 64\u201368). Strand \u03b22 and residues 61\u201363 of the \u03b13\u2013\u03b22 loop cover the hydrophobic \u03b1KG binding pocket, and the pocket is solvent exposed when the lid opens.",
        "Both forms of the Cur Hal subunit are stabilized by specific interactions (Fig. 2D). In addition to the steric effects at Arg241 that drive the switch, four parts of the protein structure converge to form a set of specific interactions in open-form Hal, including formation of a 310-like helix (residues 68\u201377) following helix \u03b14, formation of a 310 helix (residues 278\u2013282) in the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop, and ionic interactions of the Asp69, His99, Arg247, and Asp283 side chains. In the closed-to-open transition, Tyr68 in the 310-like helix moves 17 \u00c5 out of the active site (Fig. 2D). Asp283 in the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop moves 12 \u00c5 toward the active site where it forms a salt bridge with the Arg247 side chain, which has moved 5 \u00c5 out of the active site. His99 (strand \u03b23) swings 7 \u00c5 away from the active site to hydrogen bond with Asp69 in the 310-like helix. Substrate Binding and Catalysis. The five ligand states of the Cur Hal active site (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2) are consistent with the mechanism in which oxidative decarboxylation of \u03b1KG by iron-",

        "bound dioxygen creates a ferryl-oxo (Fe4\u00fe-oxo) intermediate (Fig. 3) (2, 13). The dioxygen position is occupied by a formate ion in the form II crystal structure (Fig. 2A). In this structure, the active-site lid (residues 40\u201366) is fully ordered throughout its length and the active site is inaccessible to (S)-HMG-ACP. However, in the closed subunit of the form III crystal structure, residues 48\u201359 including lid helix \u03b13 are disordered while resi-dues 60\u201366 are secured over bound \u03b1KG. Substrate access to the active site is presumably through the opening created by disorder of lid helix \u03b13 in closed-form Hal. We modeled the (S)-HMG-thioester into the active site of closed-form Cur Hal (excluding lid residues 48\u201359) so that the HMG C4 atom was near both the Cl-ligand and the ferryl-oxo O atom (Fig. 4A). Hal is highly specific for its substrate, requiring both the S-hydroxyl group at C3 and the C5-carboxylate (8). In the model, the S-hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the Ser120 side chain, which forms a hydrogen bond with Cl-in struc-tures containing \u03b1KG (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2B). The Tyr68 side chain is hydrogen bonded to the substrate thioester carbonyl. No candidate residues for recognition of the HMG carboxylate are obvious in the core of the active site. However, lid helix \u03b13 includes several basic side chains, which may recognize the (S)-HMG carboxylate. Residues that may be important for substrate recognition were probed by alanine replacement or conservative substitution (Fig. 4 and Table S2). These residues include three basic and two polar residues that may recognize (S)-HMG-ACP (Leu112, Lys48, Lys50, Lys54, Ser44, and Tyr68), and four active-site resi-dues that directly or indirectly contact \u03b1KG or chloride (Ser120, Ser132, Arg241, and Arg247). Production of 4-Cl-HMG-ACP from (S)-HMG-ACP was monitored by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS), including a phosphopantetheine (PPant)-ejection assay (19), which releases Cl-HMG-PPant from Cl-HMG-ACP (8). Catalytic efficiency was monitored by the relative abundance of Cl-HMG-PPant and HMG-PPant, which differ in m\u2215z by 34 units (Fig. 4B and Figs. S3, S4, and S5).",

        "Under our assay conditions, wild-type Hal converted about 80% of HMG-ACP to the chlorinated product (Fig. 4 B, C). As expected, substitutions for residues that anchor \u03b1KG in the active site (Arg241, Arg247) resulted in a Hal variant with no detectable activity (Fig. 4C). Ala replacement of Ser120, which is hydrogen bonded to Cl-, also abolished activity, as did the Ala substitution at Ser132, which is connected to the active site indirectly through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2A, Fig. 4C). A conser-vative substitution at Leu112 did not alter activity, whereas sub-stitutions in the active-site lid substantially diminished activity. The largest effects (greater than tenfold) were observed for the basic residues Lys50 and Lys54, and for Tyr68. The mutagen-esis data are consistent with a role in (S)-HMG (or PPant) recog-nition for Lys50, Lsy54, and Tyr68, although no single residue was essential for catalysis. The greater than tenfold effect of conservative Phe substitution for Tyr68 suggests a critical hydro-gen-bonding interaction for this side chain. The effects of the Lys48 and Ser44 substitutions were five-and sixfold, respectively, consistent with an indirect effect on catalysis, for example by altering the dynamics of the active-site lid. Discussion The structure of CurA Hal is the third for a halogenase from the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halogenase family. The structures of Hal in five ligand states (apo, Fe3\u00fe/\u03b1KG/Cl-/ formate, Fe3\u00fe/\u03b1KG/Cl-, formate, Fig. 2 and Fig. S2) provide new pictures of the active site. Together with site-directed muta-genesis results (Fig. 4) the structures are relevant to the catalytic cycle and mechanism of Hal (Fig. 3) (13, 15) and two distantly related halogenases, SyrB2 and CytC3, which have active sites nearly identical to the Cur Hal active site (9, 11). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a critical role for Ser132. This result was unexpected because Ser132 is in the center of strand \u03b24 where the Ala substitution should not alter the back-bone conformation (Fig. 4A). However, in closed-form Hal, a hydrogen bond of the Ser132 side chain helps position the Arg247 guanidinium plane to interact with \u03b1KG in the active site (Fig. 2A). The loss of activity in Ser132Ala implies that Arg247 guanidinium positioning is critical to catalysis. We suggest that the Ser-Arg pair may assist in the departure of CO2 during for-mation of succinate and the chloro-oxo-ferryl intermediate (Fig. 3). This hydrogen bond may be a general feature of the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases as the hydrogen-bonding net-work to \u03b1KG is conserved in SyrB2 and CytC3, but with a Thr/Arg pair in place of Ser/Arg. Remarkably, the new structures reveal that Cur Hal exists in two conformations and that \u03b1KG triggers a switch between these forms (Fig. 2D). We designated the forms \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d because the active-site lid (residues 40\u201365) is completely disor-dered in the open form.Anopen active site is essential to substrate access, however open-form Hal is not simply a relaxed version of the closed form nor is it equivalent to the closed form with a dis-ordered active-site lid. Rather, the open and closed forms are characterized by distinct positions for several helices and loops, stabilized by different sets of hydrogen bonds. Open-form Hal has a total of 10 more hydrogen bonds than does the closed form (excluding the 40\u201365 lid), suggesting that the open form has an important function beyond exposing the active site. The additional hydrogen bonds in open-form Hal are in the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop and the adjacent \u03b14 helix N terminus. Arg247 is a key element of the conformational transition because it is hydrogen bonded to \u03b1KG in the closed form and in the open form has two hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate of Asp283 at the N terminus of helix \u03b110, as well as a hydrogen bond with the Ser120 carbonyl oxygen. Large conformational changes triggered by \u03b1KG have not been observed for other members of the Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halogenase family, although there are few reports of companion structures with both occupied and empty \u03b1KG sites.",
        "Examples include the structures of a cephalosporin synthase (20) and an alkylsulfatase (21), in which \u03b1KG binding is accommo-dated by strictly local conformational changes relative to the free enzymes.",
        "The chemical structure of HMG may explain the need for two conformations of Hal. HMG is unusual and perhaps unique among substrates of Fe2\u00fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halo-genases in that the reactive carbon (C4, Fig. 1A) has a carboxylate substituent (C5). The proximal carboxylate is an enormous com-plication for an Fe-dependent enzyme because only two of six coordination positions are occupied by protein ligands, the four nonprotein ligands turn over in each catalytic cycle, and the sub-strate carboxylate is not a ligand. Thus, it is critical for Hal to keep the HMG carboxylate out of the Fe2\u00fe coordination sphere, perhaps by excluding (S)-HMG-ACP altogether until the halo-genase active site is assembled by Fe2\u00fe coordination of \u03b1KG and Cl-. In open-form Hal, the active site appears able to accom-modate a carboxylate at any unoccupied position in the Fe ligand sphere. Indeed, in family members that are not halogenases, a carboxylate side chain coordinates Fe at the position of Cl-in Hal and the other halogenases (17). We propose that the purpose of a specific open form of Hal is to prevent (S)-HMG-ACP from entering the active site until both \u03b1KG and Cl-are bound (Fig. 4). In this manner, the interactions of the 310-like helix preceding \u03b14, the \u03b19\u2013\u03b110 loop, and Arg247 create a barrier to (S)-HMG-ACP in open-form Hal.",
        "Hal has exquisite specificity for its substrate, (S)-HMG-ACP, requiring both the C3 S-hydroxyl group and the C5 carboxylate (8). Specificity for the C5 carboxylate is consistent with the need to engage the carboxylate with the protein and not with the Fe2\u00fe center. We assume that Hal has little specificity for the C3 R-methyl group because the 92%-identical halogenase from the jamaicamide PKS (7) accommodates a C3 R-substituent with a five-carbon chain. The exquisite substrate specificity is consistent with our finding that several residues on the active-site lid are critical to activity (Figs. 3 and 4A. Ala substitution for Lys50, Lys54, and Tyr68 resulted in more than tenfold reduction in activity in our assay conditions. Lys50 and Lys54 are thus can-didates to recognize the HMG carboxyl group. The Tyr68 hydro-xyl may hydrogen bond with the substrate thioester carbonyl oxygen, consistent with the finding that even a conservative substitution of Tyr with Phe resulted in more than tenfold loss of activity. In the core of Hal, Ala substitution for Ser120, which is hydrogen bonded to Cl-, abolished activity. The chloride hy-drogen bond is not required for halogenation because neither SyrB2 nor CytC3 has a direct hydrogen bond from protein to Cl-or a hydrogen-bonding side chain at the analogous position to Ser120. We suggest that the Ser120 side chain recognizes the C3 S-hydroxyl of HMG. In open-form Hal, the proposed sub-strate-recognition residues are otherwise occupied: Tyr68 is dis-placed 17 \u00c5 away from the active site; access to the Ser120 side chain is blocked by a hydrogen bond from the Arg247 side chain to the Ser carbonyl oxygen; and Lys50 and Lys54 are disordered.",
        "A highly reactive oxo-ferryl (O \u00bc Fe4\u00fe) intermediate forms when dioxygen binds to the iron center and decarboxylates \u03b1KG (Fig. 3). An event of \u201csubstrate triggering\u201d was proposed to explain how the Fe2\u00fe\u2215\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase/halogenases prevent formation of this reactive intermediate until the substrate is positioned (22). Substrate triggering has been observed in the SyrB2 halogenase (15), and is likely to occur in Hal as well. Thus, the substitutions at Lys50, Lys54, Tyr68, and Ser120 may prevent substrate triggering of chloro-oxo-ferryl formation in addition to any direct effects on HMG binding.",
        "The exquisite substrate selectivity of Hal is strikingly different from the situation of the SyrB2 halogenase, which formed halogenated, hydroxylated, or mixed products when presented with molecules similar to its natural substrate (16).

        "FTICR-MS nor in the PPant-ejection assay of Hal activity (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3). A conundrum of Fe2\u00fe\u2215\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases is how the enzymes resolve the substrate free radical exclusively by halogenation because both chloride and hydroxyl ligands are available at the iron center (Fig. 3). The results with SyrB2 were interpreted as evidence that the halogenation vs. hydroxylation outcome depends on substrate positioning, which was thought to vary with the chemical structure of the SyrB2 substrate (16). The possibility of a hydroxylated product from a differently positioned substrate is relevant to Hal function because the en-zyme may encounter molecules that are chemically similar to (S)-HMG-ACP (8). Hal is followed in the curacin pathway by a dehydratase and a decarboxylase. We showed previously that these enzymes can act sequentially on HMG-ACP, i.e., preceding the Hal reaction (23). If the HMG-ACP dehydration product (C2-C3 alkene) or the subsequent decarboxylation product were able to bind in the Hal active site, incorrect hydroxylated products may result. Because the ACP that carries these substrates is fused to Hal (Fig. 1A), it is critical that any dehydrated and/or decarboxylated products be unable to access the Hal active site. Thus, the exquisite substrate selectivity serves as a barrier to the competing hydroxylation reaction. The combined requirements that Hal prevent Fe coordination of the HMG C5 carboxylate, allow dioxygen reaction at the",
        "appropriate moment, and exclude inappropriate substrates from the active site may have led to both the \u03b1KG trigger for transition to a substrate-accessible state, the substrate trigger to admit dioxygen, and the exquisite substrate selectivity of Cur Hal. Methods CurA Hal and the site-directedmutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Diffraction data were collected at beamline 23ID at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The structure of crystal form I was solved by a 2.6 \u00c5 single wavelength anom-alous diffraction dataset. Crystal form II, III, and IV were solved by molecular replacement using the model from crystal form I. Conversion of (S)-HMG-ACP substrate to Cl-(S)-HMG-ACP was analyzed by FTICR-MS and an infrared mul-tiphoton dissociation (IRMPD)-based phosphopantatheine (PPant) ejection assay (8, 19).
