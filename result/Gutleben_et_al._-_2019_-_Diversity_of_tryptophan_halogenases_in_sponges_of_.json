Editor: Zhiyong Li \u2020Jasper J. Koehorst, http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8172-8981 ABSTRACT Marine sponges are a prolific source of novel enzymes with promising biotechnological potential. Especially halogenases, which are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of brominated and chlorinated secondary metabolites, possess interesting properties towards the production of pharmaceuticals that are often halogenated. In this study we used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening to simultaneously examine and compare the richness and diversity of putative tryptophan halogenase protein sequences and bacterial community structures of six Aplysina species from the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas. At the phylum level, bacterial community composition was similar amongst all investigated species and predominated by Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria. We detected four phylogenetically diverse clades of putative tryptophan halogenase protein sequences, which were only distantly related to previously reported halogenases. The Mediterranean species Aplysina aerophoba harbored unique halogenase sequences, of which the most predominant was related to a sponge-associated Psychrobacter-derived sequence. In contrast, the Caribbean species shared numerous novel halogenase sequence variants and exhibited a highly similar bacterial community composition at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level. Correlations of relative abundances of halogenases with those of bacterial taxa suggest that prominent sponge symbiotic bacteria, including Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria, are putative producers of the detected enzymes and may thus contribute to the chemical defense of their host.

The call for a bet-ter supply of new drugs against a large range of infectious diseases points towards novel natural products as a yet inex-haustible source of bioactivity. Especially the marine environ-ment proved to be a particularly rich resource for novel bioac-tive compounds, and many of them are halogenated (Gribble 2015). Carbon\u2013halogen bonds lead to an increase in thermal and oxidative stability as well as increased permeability through bio-logical membranes compared to their non-halogenated counter-parts (Smith et al. 2017). Halogenated molecules exhibit a wide range of biological activities and may have antifungal, antibac-terial, antiviral, anticancer, and/or anti-inflammatory proper-ties (Butler & Sandy 2009; Gribble 2015). Thus, many pharma-ceutical and agrochemical compounds as well as polymers are halogenated (Bolton et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012; Jeschke 2013), such as the commercially important antibiotics chlorampheni-col, vancomycin and teicoplanin (Van Pe\u0301e and Zehner 2003). In nature, halogens, including chloride, bromide, fluoride or iodide, get attached to organic molecular scaffolds by halo-genase enzymes, which have been detected in fungi, bacteria and algae from terrestrial and marine environments (Atashgahi et al. 2018; Latham et al. 2018). While marine enzymes prefer-entially halogenate with bromide (Neubauer et al. 2018), chlori-nated compounds are regularly detected in terrestrial sources (Latham et al. 2018). To date, more than 5000 naturally pro-duced halogenated compounds (Gribble 2015) and six indepen-dently evolved halogenase enzyme families have been iden-tified (Xu and Wang 2016). These enzyme families, namely cofactor-free haloperoxidase, vanadium-dependent haloperox-idase, heme iron-dependent haloperoxidase, non-heme iron-dependent halogenase, flavin-dependent halogenase, and S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent halogenase, differ in their cofactor dependence, sequence homology and mechanistic fea-tures (Xu and Wang 2016). The most extensively characterized halogenases are flavin (FADH2)-dependent halogenases (FDHs) (Van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006; Zhao et al. 2015). In contrast to haloperoxidases, FDHs often halogenate regioselectively, and are often part of secondary metabolite gene clusters encod-ing for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyke-tide synthetases (PKS)-producing halogenated molecules (Walsh et al. 2001; Van Pe\u0301e and Unversucht 2003; Dorrestein et al. 2005; Van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006). Regioselective halogenation under mild reaction conditions without harmful waste generation ren-ders FDHs promising tools for biocatalysis of halogenated com-pounds (Smith, Gru\u0308schow and Goss 2013; Gru\u0308schow et al. 2015; Shepherd et al. 2015; Menon et al. 2016; Weichold, Milbredt and Van Pe\u0301e 2016; Latham et al. 2018). The amino acid sequences of FDHs contain a highly conserved flavin binding site (GxGxxG) near the N-terminus, which binds the cofactor in order to cre-ate the reactive halogen, as well as a motif with two tryptophan residues (WxWxIP), which presumably prevents the binding of a substrate close to the flavin (Van Pe\u0301e and Zehner 2003; Van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006). These motifs can be detected in almost every FDH described today, and serve as identification marker for novel FDH genes (Bayer et al. 2013). FDHs can be distin-guished into three classes depending on their preferred sub-strate moieties: phenols, pyrroles or tryptophan (Murphy 2006; Van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006). In most cases, the exact substrates for halogenases encoded within biosynthetic gene clusters remain to be identified, however, many of the bacterial FDHs charac-terized to date halogenate a range of tryptophan derivatives and other aromatic substrates (Payne, Andorfer and Lewis 2013; Frese et al. 2014; Shepherd et al. 2015). These flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases (THs) exhibit a broad substrate toler-ance for other electron-rich organic scaffolds, although these are halogenated with lower reaction efficiencies in in vitro activ-ity tests (Weichold, Milbredt and Van Pe\u0301e 2016; Agarwal et al. 2017). Since halotryptophans occur fairly frequently in natural products (Smith et al. 2017), we focused our efforts on THs in this study. Most flavin-dependent THs described to date require the activity of an additional enzyme, a flavin reductase, to pro-vide the reduced flavin cofactor, and are thus two-component systems (Agarwal et al. 2017). Single-component halogenating enzymes possess both domains for flavin-reduction and halo-genation. To date, only two single-component halogenating enzymes have been reported from marine bacteria, but they remain poorly characterized (Agarwal and Moore 2014; Agarwal et al. 2014). Sponges as source of novel halogenase sequence variants Sponges are the most prolific marine invertebrates for the dis-covery of novel bioactive compounds (Blunt et al. 2009; Hu et al. 2011; Mehbub et al. 2014; Rocha-Martin et al. 2014; Sipkema 2017; Carroll et al. 2019) since many of them depend on a chem-ical arsenal to defend themselves against diseases, competi-tors and predators (Thoms, Ebel and Proksch 2006; Taylor et al. 2007; Pawlik 2011). These ancient, filter feeding animals harbour dense and diverse microbial communities including members of the bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteri-odetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Proteobac-teria, Nitrospira, Poribacteria, Tectomicrobia, Verrucomicrobia, as well as archaea and numerous microeukaryotes (Taylor et al. 2007; Webster and Taylor 2012; Thomas et al. 2016; Chaib De Mares et al. 2017). Some of these largely uncultured bacteria can produce highly potent bioactive natural products, many of which are halogenated (Gribble 2010; Smith et al. 2017). Amongst marine sponges, the Demosponge genus Aplysina represents a morphologically diverse group of species challenging to iden-tify due to their lack of a mineral skeleton (Zea, Henkel and Pawlik 2014), as well as a high degree of sequence conserva-tion in molecular marker genes (Erpenbeck et al. 2007; Cruz-Barraza et al. 2012). Chemotaxonomy was suggested as addi-tional phylogenetic marker (Erpenbeck and van Soest 2007), since Aplysina species are strongly chemically defended and especially renowned for the production of more than 100 halo-genated natural products (Lira et al. 2011; Loh and Pawlik 2014). Such metabolites can make up to 12% of the sponge dry weight (Turon, Becerro and Uriz 2000; Thoms, Ebel and Proksch 2006). D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /fem sec/article/95/8/fiz108/5528619 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June Gutleben et al. 3 A survey of natural products from Caribbean Aplysina species suggested that the brominated alkaloids were sponge-derived rather than microbiome-derived, since metabolite profiles were highly correlated to sponge morphotype rather than location and depth (Puyana et al. 2015). It should be noted, however, that this study did not assess microbial composition, and hence, an essential or auxiliary role of the microbiome in metabolite production cannot be excluded. Halogenated compounds have been reported to be located in spherulous cells of Aplysina aero-phoba, suggesting production by the sponge, or a complex symbi-otic pattern with microorganisms involved at different levels of the biotransformation pathway (Turon, Becerro and Uriz 2000). Significant correlations of the relative abundances of a mem-ber of the Chloroflexi, a deltaproteobacterium and an uniden-tified bacterial OTU with the concentrations of three alkaloids (aerophobin-1, aplysinamisin-1 and isofistularin-3) in A. aero-phoba indicated that bacteria were correlated to the produc-tion of brominated alkaloids (Sacrista\u0301n-Soriano et al. 2011, Sac-rista\u0301n-Soriano, Banaigs and Becerro 2016). This finding corrobo-rates observations that the majority of halogenating enzymes has been described from algae, fungi and bacteria (Xu and Wang 2016). Halogenated natural products or the correspond-ing biosynthetic gene clusters could previously be associated to specific bacterial symbionts in other marine sponges (Unson, Holland and Faulkner 1994; Flatt et al. 2005; Ridley et al. 2005; Hochmuth and Piel 2009; Della Sala et al. 2013; O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2017), but to the best of our knowledge this remains unresolved for the metabolites of Aplysina species, from both the Mediterranean and Caribbean Sea (Puyana et al. 2015; Sacrista\u0301n-Soriano, Banaigs and Becerro 2016). Currently, only dehalogenation mechanisms could be directly linked to the microbial community of A. aerophoba (Ahn et al. 2003). However, the conserved nature of key enzymes encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters allows the design of degenerate PCR primers, thus facilitating the screening and discovery of novel sequence vari-ants of these enzymes from environmental DNA (Hornung et al. 2007; Kennedy, Marchesi and Dobson 2008; Borchert et al. 2016). Accordingly, PCR-based surveys have led to the identification of numerous putative flavin-dependent halogenase encoding genes from different environmental samples (Erol, Arends and Muyzer 2017), multiple marine sponges (Bayer et al. 2013; O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013) and cultivated Actinomycetes strains (Hornung et al. 2007; Gao and Huang 2009; Liao et al. 2016). Aim With this study we aimed to investigate the phylogenetic diver-sity and distribution of flavin-dependent tryptophan haloge-nase protein sequence variants within six species of the marine sponge genus Aplysina. By using 16S rRNA and TH gene amplicon sequencing, we aimed to determine the resident sponge bacte-rial community of different Aplysina species and explore poten-tial links between the microbial populations and the associated halogenase sequences. This will increase our understanding of the putative producers of halogenated secondary metabolites in sponges. MATERIALS and METHODS Sponge collection Three individuals, each of the Caribbean sponge species Aplysina archeri (AAr), Aplysina cauliformis (ACa), Aplysina fistularis (AFi), Aplysina fulva (AFu) and Aplysina lacunosa (ALa), were collected around Bonaire by SCUBA diving at depths between 1 and 10 m on 8 and 9 October 2012 (Table 1). A sampling permit was given to Detmer Sipkema by the government of Bonaire. Sam-pled sponge individuals grew at least 1 m apart from each other. The sponge species were identified in the field by Dr. Shirley Pomponi. After sampling, the sponge fragments were rinsed three times with sterile artificial seawater (ASW, 33 g/L Reef Crystals, Blacksburg, VA, USA), cut into 1 cm3 pieces and stored in RNAlater (Sigma Aldrich) at -20\u25e6C. Additionally, three indi-viduals of the Mediterranean sponge species Aplysina aerophoba (AAe) were collected by SCUBA diving at Cala Montgo, Spain (N 42.114, E 3.168), on 19 October 2010 and 15 January 2012. The collection of A. aerophoba samples was conducted in strict accor-dance with Spanish and European regulations within the rules of the Spanish National Research Council with the approval of the Directorate of Research of the Spanish Government. After sampling, the sponges were transported to the labora-tory and rinsed three times with sterile artificial seawater (ASW) before grinding with a sterilized mortar and pestle. To obtain a homogenous cell suspension, two volumes of ASW were added. Cell suspensions were aliquoted and mixed with sterile glyc-erol in ASW for a final concentration of 17% glycerol. Samples were frozen at -20\u25e6C and stored at -80\u25e6C until DNA extraction (Sipkema et al. 2011). DNA isolation DNA was extracted using the FastDNA Spinkit for Soil (MP Bio-chemicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with the following modification for the first step: instead of using 500 mg of soil, 750 \u03bcl of cryopreserved Aplysina aerophoba cell suspension was centrifuged at 14 000 g for 10 min, and the pellet was used for the extraction. For the Caribbean sponge species, 500 mg of wet-weight sponge tissue was rinsed in sterile ASW, cut into small pieces and used for DNA extrac-tion. PCR amplification of tryptophan halogenase genes A PCR-based method was used to screen the sponge samples for the presence and identity of potential flavin-dependent tryp-tophan halogenase genes. In a preliminary screening among previously reported primers, the degenerate halogenase gene targeted primers SZ002 and SZ005 (Zehner et al. 2005) were found the most suitable to amplify an approximately 500 bp DNA fragment. Barcoded PCR amplicons (1 specific bar-code for each sample) were obtained through a two-step PCR reaction. For the first PCR reaction, the halogenase primers (SZ002 and SZ005) included linker sequences (341F and 806R): 341F-SZ002 5\u2032-CMTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-\u30080:bold \u3009TCGGYGTSGGC GARGCGACCRTCCC-\u3008/0:bold\u30093\u30080:named-content 0:content-typ e=\u201dword-wrap\u201d\u3009\u2032\u3008/0:named-content\u3009 and 806R-SZ005 5\u30080:name d-content 0:content-type=\u201dword-wrap\u201d\u3009\u2032\u3008/0:named-content\u3009-G GACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-\u30080:bold \u3009GCCGGAGCAGTCGAYGAAS AGGTC\u3008/0:bold\u3009-3\u30080:named-content 0:content-type=\u201dword-wra p\u201d\u3009\u2032\u3008/0:named-content\u3009. The linker sequences represent the binding regions for the barcoding primers in the second PCR. As we routinely use barcoded 16S rRNA gene targeted primers for prokaryotic community composition analysis, we employed those for barcoding of the less routinely used TH gene-targeted primers. Thus, the more widely used barcoding primers could be applied to barcode halogenase gene amplicons. The first PCR amplification was performed in a volume of 50 \u03bcL using 10 \u03bcL 5x GoTaq buffer, 2 \u03bcL 10 mM dNTP mixture, D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /fem sec/article/95/8/fiz108/5528619 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June 4 FEMS Microbiology Ecology, 2019, Vol. 95, No. 8 Ta b le 1.

PCR con-ditions were initial denaturation (94\u25e6C for 5 min), followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94\u25e6C for 30 s), annealing (60\u25e6C for 40 s), elongation (72\u25e6C for 50 s) and a final extension (72\u25e6C for 5 min). Amplification products were visualized on a 1.25% (w/v) agarose gel and purified using the Millipore DNA Gel Extrac-tion Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). A second barcoding PCR was performed as described earlier, except that a pyrosequenc-ing adapter A (CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG) and 18 different barcodes of 10 nucleotides length connected to the 341F linker sequence were used as forward primer and pyrose-quencing adapter B (CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAG) connected to the 806R linker sequence as reverse primer. Fur-thermore, the number of amplification cycles was reduced to 15. PCR products were visualized on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel, and the bands of PCR products were excised from the gel and puri-fied as described earlier. The amplified fragments with adapter and barcodes were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Invit-rogen) and mixed in approximately equal concentrations (4 \u00d7 105 copies \u03bcL-1) to ensure equal representation of each sample in the pool. A 454-sequencing run was performed on a GS FLX Standard PicoTiterPlate (70 \u00d7 75) using a GS FLX pyrosequenc-ing system according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) at the Technical University of Copen-hagen. Pyrosequencing data of halogenase genes were deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under sample accession numbers SRR7853828\u2013SRR7853845. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes Barcoded amplicons of bacterial 16S rRNA genes for all sponge samples were amplified from the extracted DNA. PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 100 \u03bcL containing 20 \u03bcL High Fidelity Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 2.5 \u03bcL 10 \u03bcM 338R-I, 2.5 \u03bcL 10 \u03bcM 338R-II reverse primer (Daims et al. 1999), 2 \u03bcL 10 mM dNTP mixture, 1 \u03bcL 2 U/\u03bcL Phusion Hot start II DNA polymerase, 65 \u03bcL nuclease free water. 5 \u03bcl 27F-DegS forward primer (van den Bogert et al. 2011) with Tita-nium adapter A and a sample-specific barcode (8nt) (Hamady et al. 2008) attached to the 5\u2032-end as well as 2 \u03bcL template DNA (10\u201320 ng/\u03bcL) were added to each reaction. Amplification con-ditions were initial denaturation (98\u25e6C for 30 s), followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (98\u25e6C for 10 s), annealing (56\u25e6C for 20 s), elongation (72\u25e6C for 20 s) and a final extension (72\u25e6C for 10 min). Amplification products were visualized, purified, pooled and sequenced as described earlier. Pyrosequencing data of 16S rRNA genes were deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under sample accession numbers SRR7853935\u2013SRR7853950. Halogenase gene amplicon data analysis Halogenase gene pyrosequencing data were demultiplexed using QIIME version 1.9.0 (Caporaso et al. 2010). Sequences that (i) were shorter than 200 bp or longer than 1000 bp, (ii) con-tained more than one mismatch in the forward or reverse primer sequences, (iii) contained ambiguous bases or (iv) were rep-resented with less than three reads were removed. Chimeric sequences were detected using the usearch61 algorithm (Edgar 2010) and removed. Two samples (AAe2 and AFi3) did not pass quality criteria of the 16S rRNA gene data analysis and were thus also removed from the halogenase gene analyses. The remain-ing sequences were translated into the three forward open read-ing frames using the transeq algorithm (Blankenberg et al. 2007) as implemented in Galaxy (Afgan et al. 2016), and ORFs con-taining stop codons were removed using customized Bash and R scripts (https://github.com/mibwurrepo/Gutleben et.al Halog enases Aplysinas). Sequences were clustered at 95% amino acid sequence identity based on the average protein sequence iden-tity in genomes of the same bacterial species (Rodriguez-R and Konstantinidis 2014; Chaib De Mares et al. 2018) using the uclust algorithm (Edgar 2010). The most abundant sequence per cluster was retained as representative sequence. For identification of putative flavin-dependent TH sequences, a reference database was created, by subset-ting the UniProt/SwissProt database (Bairoch 2002; Bateman et al. 2017) to 5427 \u2018halogenase\u2019 protein entries, since similarity searches to smaller databases return more sensitive results (Jagtap et al. 2013; Pearson 2014). Of these, 75 were manually annotated and reviewed entries (SwissProt). Representative amino acid sequences were aligned (blastp) against (i) the entire UniProt/SwissProt database (release 2018 02) and (ii) the halogenase database using the Diamond alignment tool (Buchfink et al. 2014). Protein families (Pfam) were assigned using the InterProScan pipeline 5.17 (Quevillon et al. 2005) based on an evalue cutoff of 10-6. Amino acid sequences that aligned significantly (e-value < 0.001; Pearson 2014) against an entry in the halogenase database were retained for phylogenetic analyses. Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm (Larkin et al. 2007), together with the most closely related database entries, four reference sequences (tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH (Strepto-myces rugosporus, A4D0H5), flavin-dependent TH RebH (Lecheva-lieria aerocolonigenes, Q8KHZ8), flavin-dependent TH PrnA (Pseu-domonas fluorescens, P95480), halogenase ClaH (Streptomyces uncialis, G3K6J6)), putative TH protein sequences previously found in the sponge C. crambe (O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013) and the out-group sequences NADH-dependent flavin oxidoreductase BaiH (Clostridium scindens, P32370) and NADPH-flavin oxidoreductase Frp (Vibrio harveyi, Q56691). The halogenase sequences from A. aerophoba obtained by Bayer et al. (2013) could not be included in this analysis since they covered a different region of the gene. The resulting alignment was manually refined and trimmed to the amplified regions excluding the primers using Jalview (Waterhouse et al. 2009). A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was calculated using RaXML HPC (Stamatakis 2006) under the PROTGAMMAWAG substitution model, and 100 bootstrap replicates were used to evaluate clusters. The best-scoring tree was visualized using iTol (Letunic and Bork 2016). R (version 3.4.3) (Sasaki, Massaki and Kubo 2005) was used for diversity analyses of amino acid sequences identified as putative tryptophan halogenases. For visualization and interpretation, relative abundance information was used for interpretation and was visualized using the ggplot2 v.2.2.1 package (Wickham 2016). Weighted UniFrac dissimilarities (Lozupone et al. 2011) were cal-culated and ordinated using Principal Coordinates Analysis as implemented in the phyloseq package (McMurdie and Holmes 2013). Phyloseq and the microbiome package (Lahti et al. 2017) were used for calculating observed richness and Shannon index diversity. Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity was calculated using the package picante (Kembel et al. 2010). Venn diagrams were calcu-lated and visualized using online tool jvenn (Bourtzis et al. 1996). Caribbean core halogenases were defined as being present in at least one sample from all the Caribbean species and identified using jvenn.

D. Schloss et al. 2009) by follow-ing the 454 Standard operating procedure (https://www.moth ur.org/wiki/454 SOP). In brief, sequences were demultiplexed, denoised, and sequences with (i) more than two mismatches in the primers, (ii) more than one mismatch in the barcode and (iii) more than 8 homopolymer were discarded (trim.flows and trim.seqs commands). Reads were reduced to unique sequences (unique.seqs) and aligned to the SILVA SSU 128 database (Quast et al. 2013) (align.seqs: flip = t). Aligned reads were kept (screen.seqs: optimize = start-end, criteria = 98, minlength = 250), and empty alignment columns were removed (filter.seqs: vertical = T, trump = .). Read counts for sequences that were within \u226599% sequence similarity to a more abundant sequence were merged (pre.cluster: diffs = 2). Chimeric sequences were detected with Vsearch (chimera.vsearch) (Rognes et al. 2016) and removed (remove.seqs). Taxonomy was assigned using the SILVA SSU 128 database (classify.seqs: cutoff = 80) (Wang et al. 2007). Sequences that were not classified at Domain level as well as chloroplast sequences were removed (remove.lineage). Uncor-rected pairwise distances between aligned sequences were cal-culated (dist.seqs: cutoff = 0.15), OTUs were generated on the basis of 97% sequence identity (cluster: method = opti, cutoff = 0.03), and files were converted to .shared format (make.shared: list = , group = ,). Taxonomy was assigned to OTUs (classify.otu: list = , name = , taxonomy = , label = 0.03), and representative sequences for each OTU were picked (get.oturep: phylip = , list = , fasta = , label = 0.03, sorted = size). Further OTU table processing was done with Bash and R scripts (https://github.com/mibwurr epo/Gutleben et.al Halogenases Aplysinas). Relative abundance information was used for visualization and interpretation. Cal-culation of community metrics and UniFrac dissimilarities were performed as described earlier. Core taxa were defined as being present in at least one sam-ple from all analyzed sponge species, or from all Caribbean sponge species (Caribbean core) and were identified using jvenn. Correlations between relative halogenase and bacterial abun-dances were expressed as Spearman coefficients for all taxa and all halogenase genes, as well as for the Caribbean core taxa and core halogenase genes. Only coefficients >\u00b10.5 and with P < 0.05 were considered significant, and only taxa and halogenases shared by all Caribbean species were included in this analysis to maximize statistical power. Heatmaps were generated using the pheatmap v1.0.8 package (Kolde 2012). Analyses are avail-able as R Markdown (https://github.com/mibwurrepo/Gutleben et.al Halogenases Aplysinas). RESULTS Identification of putative tryptophan halogenases To capture the diversity of PCR-amplified halogenase genes in Aplysina species, 454-pyrosequencing was performed. A total of 37 374 DNA reads, representing 3653 unique protein sequences, were obtained from TH gene-targeted amplicon sequencing. After clustering the unique sequences at 95% amino acid sequence identity, 1918 protein sequence clusters were retained with a maximum of 109 sequences per cluster. Detailed results per sample are given in Table 1. Out of the representative (most abundant) sequences of these 1918 clusters, 1654 (86.24%) resulted in a hit against the entire UniProt protein database. However, only 40 sequences aligned significantly (e-value <0.001; Pearson 2014) against two flavin-dependent TH entries present in the UniProt database with low sequence identities (<45% amino acid identity) and low bitscores (mean = 56). Thus, the 1918 sequences were blasted against a manually curated \u2018halogenase\u2019 protein database con-taining the halogenase protein sequence subset (5427 entries) from UniProt. In total, 86 sequences (4.5%) resulted in a signifi-cant (e-value <0.001) hit against 1 of 16 entries from the \u2018halo-genase\u2019 database with high amino acid sequence similarities (32.9\u2013100%) and high bitscores (mean = 173; Table 2) and were thus identified as putative TH protein sequence fragments. Of these 86 sequences, 25 had 67\u201380% amino acid sequence iden-tity to a TH from marine gammaproteobacterium HTCC2080, an abundant oligotrophic marine microorganism belonging to the NOR5/OM60 clade (Cho and Giovannoni 2004; Thrash et al. 2010). Another 19 sequences matched most closely (82\u2013100%) to a TH fragment from Psychrobacter sp. D8, a gammaproteobacterium isolated from the sponge Crambe crambe (O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013). The closest database match of another 15 sequences, although with lower (36\u201351%) amino acid sequence identity, was a TH from the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. NIES-2100 (Hirose et al. 2017). Additionally, the 86 protein sequences with significant \u2018halo-genase\u2019 database hits were also investigated for protein domains using InterProScan (Finn et al. 2017). This confirmed for 84 sequences that they belong to the \u2018Tryptophan halogenase\u2019 pro-tein family (PF04820) and all contained a flavin-TH domain (IPR006905). Only two short protein sequences (S1691 and S1792), which were identified as TH by blastp, did not contain a detectable domain. Phylogenetic analyses of putative tryptophan halogenases Phylogenetic analyses of the 86 identified putative TH pro-tein sequences resulted in four distinct clades, and only two sequences (S1874 and S2870) did not cluster within these four clades (Fig. 1). Except for A. aerophoba, all analyzed sponge species contained halogenases from all four phyloge-netic clades. The largest clade (Clade 1) contained 30 sequences, followed by Clade 4 (25 sequences), Clade 3 (19 sequences) and Clade 2 (10 sequences). Only one species-specific halogenase clade could be identi-fied, namely an A. lacunosa-specific subclade within Clade 2 (7 out of 10 sequences; Fig. 1). The sequences within this subclade were all most closely related to a TH from a Dehalococcoidales bacterium (A0A2E9M8J4). Within Clade 3 (19 sequences), the halogenase most abundant (88%) in A. aerophoba (S1779) was closely related to a putative halogenase sequence (K7XJ2) pre-viously detected in Mediterranean C. crambe as well as to a halogenase from Psychrobacter sp. D8 isolated from the same sponge (O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013). Especially Clade 4 (25 sequences) was only distantly related to previously reported halogenases from Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria and contained mainly sequences from Caribbean Aplysina spp., indicating a large num-ber of novel halogenases within these sponges and their micro-biota. The well-characterized flavin-dependent TH gene prod-ucts RebH (L. aerocolonigenes, Q8KHZ8; Yeh et al. 2007) and PrnA (P. fluorescens, P95480; Dong et al. 2005) clustered outside the sponge-derived clades and were closely related to only one not abundant (<1%) sequence from A. aerophoba (S2870). While the Caribbean species shared many halogenases, it is notewor-thy that sequences from the Mediterranean A. aerophoba were closely related to Caribbean halogenase sequences, albeit in no D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /fem sec/article/95/8/fiz108/5528619 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June Gutleben et al. 7 Table 2.

Heatmap displaying significant (Spearman r > 0.5, P < 0.05) co-Gutleben et al. 11 studies are necessary to unravel the exact functions of these enzymes as no closely related enzymes have been functionally characterized (Fig. 1). Prominent sponge symbionts are potential halogenase producers In an attempt to predict the potential bacterial producers of the detected halogenase genes, we correlated the relative abun-dances of the four 16S rRNA gene OTUs and the 85 puta-tive halogenases shared by the Caribbean Aplysina species. We hypothesized that the shared halogenases are produced by bac-teria that can be found amongst the shared bacterial taxa in the different sponge species. Furthermore, an increased rela-tive abundance of the producers is expected to be reflected in an increased number of detected halogenase genes. Two halo-genases (S0310 and S3275) were most highly correlated with sponge-associated Chloroflexi (Otu0069 and Otu0228, respec-tively; Fig. 3). These clades include predominant sponge sym-bionts with the genomic repertoire for chemical defense (Slaby et al. 2017; Bayer et al. 2018). Chloroflexi were previously found to contain halogenases (Bayer et al. 2013) and were linked to the production of brominated compounds in A. aerophoba (Sacrista\u0301n-Soriano et al. 2011, Sacrista\u0301n-Soriano, Banaigs and Becerro 2016). We furthermore detected strong correlation of a halogenase sequence to a Nitrospinae OTU, however little is known about this taxon in sponges to date. Nonetheless, Nitro-spinae are closely related to the candidate phylum Tectomicro-bia, which occurs in Aplysina species (Chaib De Mares et al. 2018) and of which some members are renowned for their large sec-ondary metabolism gene repertoire (Wilson et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2017). One highly predominant cyanobacterial OTU was present in all Caribbean species and was not significantly correlated to halogenases in this study, adding to the hypothesis that the role of Cyanobacteria in sponge-microbe symbioses of high micro-bial abundance sponges might be mainly related to nutrient production rather than chemical defense (Freeman et al. 2013; Burgsdorf et al. 2015). In low microbial abundance sponges, how-ever, the production of brominated metabolites has been linked to cyanobacterial symbionts (Unson, Holland and Faulkner, 1994; Flatt et al. 2005). Thus, our results support previous find-ings and for the first time indicate potential microbial producers of brominated compounds found in Caribbean Aplysina species. However, further studies, including comparative and functinoal genomics of sponge symbionts, are necessary to reliably link halogenated compound production to their microbial producers. CONCLUSION The plethora of previously undescribed putative flavin-dependent THs from the metagenomic DNA of Mediterranean and Caribbean Aplysina species unraveled here indicates a large potential for the discovery of novel halogenating enzymes from these marine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes. The separation into four phylogenetically distinct clades of halogenase protein sequences indicates that multiple classes of organic scaffolds may be halogenated by sponge-associated microbes. High bacterial diversity was in most cases indica-tive of a high halogenase diversity, and while the Caribbean species shared many halogenases as well as bacterial OTUs, the Mediterranean A. aerophoba could be clearly distinguished. Based on co-occurrence, three prominent bacterial sponge symbionts belonging to the Chloroflexi and Nitrospinae were identified as potential sources of abundant halogenases. These results may thus contribute to explaining the origin of the numerous halogenated compounds discovered in Aplysina species. SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Supplementary data are available at FEMSEC online.

        "ABSTRACT Marine sponges are a prolific source of novel enzymes with promising biotechnological potential. Especially halogenases, which are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of brominated and chlorinated secondary metabolites, possess interesting properties towards the production of pharmaceuticals that are often halogenated. In this study we used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening to simultaneously examine and compare the richness and diversity of putative tryptophan halogenase protein sequences and bacterial community structures of six Aplysina species from the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas. At the phylum level, bacterial community composition was similar amongst all investigated species and predominated by Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria. We detected four phylogenetically diverse clades of putative tryptophan halogenase protein sequences, which were only distantly related to previously reported halogenases. The Mediterranean species Aplysina aerophoba harbored unique halogenase sequences, of which the most predominant was related to a sponge-associated Psychrobacter-derived sequence. In contrast, the Caribbean species shared numerous novel halogenase sequence variants and exhibited a highly similar bacterial community composition at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level. Correlations of relative abundances of halogenases with those of bacterial taxa suggest that prominent sponge symbiotic bacteria, including Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria, are putative producers of the detected enzymes and may thus contribute to the chemical defense of their host.",

        "INTRODUCTION Bioactive compounds and the role of halogenase enzymes The need to discover novel drug candidates is high on the policy agenda due to the ongoing emergence of multi-drug resistant microbial strains (O\u2019Neill 2016). The call for a bet-ter supply of new drugs against a large range of infectious diseases points towards novel natural products as a yet inex-haustible source of bioactivity. Especially the marine environ-ment proved to be a particularly rich resource for novel bioac-tive compounds, and many of them are halogenated (Gribble 2015). Carbon\u2013halogen bonds lead to an increase in thermal and oxidative stability as well as increased permeability through bio-logical membranes compared to their non-halogenated counter-parts (Smith et al. 2017). Halogenated molecules exhibit a wide range of biological activities and may have antifungal, antibac-terial, antiviral, anticancer, and/or anti-inflammatory proper-ties (Butler & Sandy 2009; Gribble 2015). Thus, many pharma-ceutical and agrochemical compounds as well as polymers are halogenated (Bolton et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012; Jeschke 2013), such as the commercially important antibiotics chlorampheni-col, vancomycin and teicoplanin (Van Pe\u0301e and Zehner 2003). In nature, halogens, including chloride, bromide, fluoride or iodide, get attached to organic molecular scaffolds by halo-genase enzymes, which have been detected in fungi, bacteria and algae from terrestrial and marine environments (Atashgahi et al. 2018; Latham et al. 2018). While marine enzymes prefer-entially halogenate with bromide (Neubauer et al. 2018), chlori-nated compounds are regularly detected in terrestrial sources (Latham et al. 2018). To date, more than 5000 naturally pro-duced halogenated compounds (Gribble 2015) and six indepen-dently evolved halogenase enzyme families have been iden-tified (Xu and Wang 2016). These enzyme families, namely cofactor-free haloperoxidase, vanadium-dependent haloperox-idase, heme iron-dependent haloperoxidase, non-heme iron-dependent halogenase, flavin-dependent halogenase, and S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent halogenase, differ in their cofactor dependence, sequence homology and mechanistic fea-tures (Xu and Wang 2016). The most extensively characterized halogenases are flavin (FADH2)-dependent halogenases (FDHs) (Van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006; Zhao et al. 2015). In contrast to haloperoxidases, FDHs often halogenate regioselectively, and are often part of secondary metabolite gene clusters encod-ing for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyke-tide synthetases (PKS)-producing halogenated molecules (Walsh et al. 2001; Van Pe\u0301e and Unversucht 2003; Dorrestein et al. 2005; Van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006). Regioselective halogenation under mild reaction conditions without harmful waste generation ren-ders FDHs promising tools for biocatalysis of halogenated com-pounds (Smith, Gru\u0308schow and Goss 2013; Gru\u0308schow et al. 2015; Shepherd et al. 2015; Menon et al. 2016; Weichold, Milbredt and Van Pe\u0301e 2016; Latham et al. 2018). The amino acid sequences of FDHs contain a highly conserved flavin binding site (GxGxxG) near the N-terminus, which binds the cofactor in order to cre-ate the reactive halogen, as well as a motif with two tryptophan residues (WxWxIP), which presumably prevents the binding of a substrate close to the flavin (Van Pe\u0301e and Zehner 2003; Van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006). These motifs can be detected in almost every FDH described today, and serve as identification marker for novel FDH genes (Bayer et al. 2013). FDHs can be distin-guished into three classes depending on their preferred sub-strate moieties: phenols, pyrroles or tryptophan (Murphy 2006; Van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006). In most cases, the exact substrates for halogenases encoded within biosynthetic gene clusters remain to be identified, however, many of the bacterial FDHs charac-terized to date halogenate a range of tryptophan derivatives and other aromatic substrates (Payne, Andorfer and Lewis 2013; Frese et al. 2014; Shepherd et al. 2015). These flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases (THs) exhibit a broad substrate toler-ance for other electron-rich organic scaffolds, although these are halogenated with lower reaction efficiencies in in vitro activ-ity tests (Weichold, Milbredt and Van Pe\u0301e 2016; Agarwal et al. 2017). Since halotryptophans occur fairly frequently in natural products (Smith et al. 2017), we focused our efforts on THs in this study. Most flavin-dependent THs described to date require the activity of an additional enzyme, a flavin reductase, to pro-vide the reduced flavin cofactor, and are thus two-component systems (Agarwal et al. 2017). Single-component halogenating enzymes possess both domains for flavin-reduction and halo-genation. To date, only two single-component halogenating enzymes have been reported from marine bacteria, but they remain poorly characterized (Agarwal and Moore 2014; Agarwal et al. 2014).",
        "Sponges as source of novel halogenase sequence variants Sponges are the most prolific marine invertebrates for the dis-covery of novel bioactive compounds (Blunt et al. 2009; Hu et al. 2011; Mehbub et al. 2014; Rocha-Martin et al. 2014; Sipkema 2017; Carroll et al. 2019) since many of them depend on a chem-ical arsenal to defend themselves against diseases, competi-tors and predators (Thoms, Ebel and Proksch 2006; Taylor et al. 2007; Pawlik 2011). These ancient, filter feeding animals harbour dense and diverse microbial communities including members of the bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteri-odetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Proteobac-teria, Nitrospira, Poribacteria, Tectomicrobia, Verrucomicrobia, as well as archaea and numerous microeukaryotes (Taylor et al. 2007; Webster and Taylor 2012; Thomas et al. 2016; Chaib De Mares et al. 2017). Some of these largely uncultured bacteria can produce highly potent bioactive natural products, many of which are halogenated (Gribble 2010; Smith et al. 2017). Amongst marine sponges, the Demosponge genus Aplysina represents a morphologically diverse group of species challenging to iden-tify due to their lack of a mineral skeleton (Zea, Henkel and Pawlik 2014), as well as a high degree of sequence conserva-tion in molecular marker genes (Erpenbeck et al. 2007; Cruz-Barraza et al. 2012). Chemotaxonomy was suggested as addi-tional phylogenetic marker (Erpenbeck and van Soest 2007), since Aplysina species are strongly chemically defended and especially renowned for the production of more than 100 halo-genated natural products (Lira et al. 2011; Loh and Pawlik 2014). Such metabolites can make up to 12% of the sponge dry weight (Turon, Becerro and Uriz 2000; Thoms, Ebel and Proksch 2006).",

        "A survey of natural products from Caribbean Aplysina species suggested that the brominated alkaloids were sponge-derived rather than microbiome-derived, since metabolite profiles were highly correlated to sponge morphotype rather than location and depth (Puyana et al. 2015). It should be noted, however, that this study did not assess microbial composition, and hence, an essential or auxiliary role of the microbiome in metabolite production cannot be excluded. Halogenated compounds have been reported to be located in spherulous cells of Aplysina aero-phoba, suggesting production by the sponge, or a complex symbi-otic pattern with microorganisms involved at different levels of the biotransformation pathway (Turon, Becerro and Uriz 2000). Significant correlations of the relative abundances of a mem-ber of the Chloroflexi, a deltaproteobacterium and an uniden-tified bacterial OTU with the concentrations of three alkaloids (aerophobin-1, aplysinamisin-1 and isofistularin-3) in A. aero-phoba indicated that bacteria were correlated to the produc-tion of brominated alkaloids (Sacrista\u0301n-Soriano et al. 2011, Sac-rista\u0301n-Soriano, Banaigs and Becerro 2016). This finding corrobo-rates observations that the majority of halogenating enzymes has been described from algae, fungi and bacteria (Xu and Wang 2016). Halogenated natural products or the correspond-ing biosynthetic gene clusters could previously be associated to specific bacterial symbionts in other marine sponges (Unson, Holland and Faulkner 1994; Flatt et al. 2005; Ridley et al. 2005; Hochmuth and Piel 2009; Della Sala et al. 2013; O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2017), but to the best of our knowledge this remains unresolved for the metabolites of Aplysina species, from both the Mediterranean and Caribbean Sea (Puyana et al. 2015; Sacrista\u0301n-Soriano, Banaigs and Becerro 2016). Currently, only dehalogenation mechanisms could be directly linked to the microbial community of A. aerophoba (Ahn et al. 2003). However, the conserved nature of key enzymes encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters allows the design of degenerate PCR primers, thus facilitating the screening and discovery of novel sequence vari-ants of these enzymes from environmental DNA (Hornung et al. 2007; Kennedy, Marchesi and Dobson 2008; Borchert et al. 2016). Accordingly, PCR-based surveys have led to the identification of numerous putative flavin-dependent halogenase encoding genes from different environmental samples (Erol, Arends and Muyzer 2017), multiple marine sponges (Bayer et al. 2013; O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013) and cultivated Actinomycetes strains (Hornung et al. 2007; Gao and Huang 2009; Liao et al. 2016).",
        "Aim With this study we aimed to investigate the phylogenetic diver-sity and distribution of flavin-dependent tryptophan haloge-nase protein sequence variants within six species of the marine sponge genus Aplysina. By using 16S rRNA and TH gene amplicon sequencing, we aimed to determine the resident sponge bacte-rial community of different Aplysina species and explore poten-tial links between the microbial populations and the associated halogenase sequences. This will increase our understanding of the putative producers of halogenated secondary metabolites in sponges.",
        "MATERIALS and METHODS Sponge collection Three individuals, each of the Caribbean sponge species Aplysina archeri (AAr), Aplysina cauliformis (ACa), Aplysina fistularis (AFi), Aplysina fulva (AFu) and Aplysina lacunosa (ALa), were collected around Bonaire by SCUBA diving at depths between 1 and 10 m on 8 and 9 October 2012 (Table 1). A sampling permit was given to Detmer Sipkema by the government of Bonaire. Sam-pled sponge individuals grew at least 1 m apart from each other. The sponge species were identified in the field by Dr. Shirley Pomponi. After sampling, the sponge fragments were rinsed three times with sterile artificial seawater (ASW, 33 g/L Reef Crystals, Blacksburg, VA, USA), cut into 1 cm3 pieces and stored in RNAlater (Sigma Aldrich) at -20\u25e6C. Additionally, three indi-viduals of the Mediterranean sponge species Aplysina aerophoba (AAe) were collected by SCUBA diving at Cala Montgo, Spain (N 42.114, E 3.168), on 19 October 2010 and 15 January 2012. The collection of A. aerophoba samples was conducted in strict accor-dance with Spanish and European regulations within the rules of the Spanish National Research Council with the approval of the Directorate of Research of the Spanish Government. After sampling, the sponges were transported to the labora-tory and rinsed three times with sterile artificial seawater (ASW) before grinding with a sterilized mortar and pestle. To obtain a homogenous cell suspension, two volumes of ASW were added. Cell suspensions were aliquoted and mixed with sterile glyc-erol in ASW for a final concentration of 17% glycerol. Samples were frozen at -20\u25e6C and stored at -80\u25e6C until DNA extraction (Sipkema et al. 2011).",
        "DNA isolation DNA was extracted using the FastDNA Spinkit for Soil (MP Bio-chemicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with the following modification for the first step: instead of using 500 mg of soil, 750 \u03bcl of cryopreserved Aplysina aerophoba cell suspension was centrifuged at 14 000 g for 10 min, and the pellet was used for the extraction. For the Caribbean sponge species, 500 mg of wet-weight sponge tissue was rinsed in sterile ASW, cut into small pieces and used for DNA extrac-tion.",
        "PCR amplification of tryptophan halogenase genes A PCR-based method was used to screen the sponge samples for the presence and identity of potential flavin-dependent tryp-tophan halogenase genes. In a preliminary screening among previously reported primers, the degenerate halogenase gene targeted primers SZ002 and SZ005 (Zehner et al. 2005) were found the most suitable to amplify an approximately 500 bp DNA fragment. Barcoded PCR amplicons (1 specific bar-code for each sample) were obtained through a two-step PCR reaction. For the first PCR reaction, the halogenase primers (SZ002 and SZ005) included linker sequences (341F and 806R): 341F-SZ002 5\u2032-CMTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-\u30080:bold \u3009TCGGYGTSGGC GARGCGACCRTCCC-\u3008/0:bold\u30093\u30080:named-content 0:content-typ e=\u201dword-wrap\u201d\u3009\u2032\u3008/0:named-content\u3009 and 806R-SZ005 5\u30080:name d-content 0:content-type=\u201dword-wrap\u201d\u3009\u2032\u3008/0:named-content\u3009-G GACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-\u30080:bold \u3009GCCGGAGCAGTCGAYGAAS AGGTC\u3008/0:bold\u3009-3\u30080:named-content 0:content-type=\u201dword-wra p\u201d\u3009\u2032\u3008/0:named-content\u3009. The linker sequences represent the binding regions for the barcoding primers in the second PCR. As we routinely use barcoded 16S rRNA gene targeted primers for prokaryotic community composition analysis, we employed those for barcoding of the less routinely used TH gene-targeted primers. Thus, the more widely used barcoding primers could be applied to barcode halogenase gene amplicons.",

In brief, sequences were demultiplexed, denoised, and sequences with (i) more than two mismatches in the primers, (ii) more than one mismatch in the barcode and (iii) more than 8 homopolymer were discarded (trim.flows and trim.seqs commands). Reads were reduced to unique sequences (unique.seqs) and aligned to the SILVA SSU 128 database (Quast et al. 2013) (align.seqs: flip = t). Aligned reads were kept (screen.seqs: optimize = start-end, criteria = 98, minlength = 250), and empty alignment columns were removed (filter.seqs: vertical = T, trump = .). Read counts for sequences that were within \u226599% sequence similarity to a more abundant sequence were merged (pre.cluster: diffs = 2). Chimeric sequences were detected with Vsearch (chimera.vsearch) (Rognes et al. 2016) and removed (remove.seqs).

After clustering the unique sequences at 95% amino acid sequence identity, 1918 protein sequence clusters were retained with a maximum of 109 sequences per cluster. Detailed results per sample are given in Table 1.",
        "Out of the representative (most abundant) sequences of these 1918 clusters, 1654 (86.24%) resulted in a hit against the entire UniProt protein database. However, only 40 sequences aligned significantly (e-value <0.001; Pearson 2014) against two flavin-dependent TH entries present in the UniProt database with low sequence identities (<45% amino acid identity) and low bitscores (mean = 56). Thus, the 1918 sequences were blasted against a manually curated \u2018halogenase\u2019 protein database con-taining the halogenase protein sequence subset (5427 entries) from UniProt. In total, 86 sequences (4.5%) resulted in a signifi-cant (e-value <0.001) hit against 1 of 16 entries from the \u2018halo-genase\u2019 database with high amino acid sequence similarities (32.9\u2013100%) and high bitscores (mean = 173; Table 2) and were thus identified as putative TH protein sequence fragments. Of these 86 sequences, 25 had 67\u201380% amino acid sequence iden-tity to a TH from marine gammaproteobacterium HTCC2080, an abundant oligotrophic marine microorganism belonging to the NOR5/OM60 clade (Cho and Giovannoni 2004; Thrash et al. 2010). Another 19 sequences matched most closely (82\u2013100%) to a TH fragment from Psychrobacter sp. D8, a gammaproteobacterium isolated from the sponge Crambe crambe (O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013). The closest database match of another 15 sequences, although with lower (36\u201351%) amino acid sequence identity, was a TH from the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. NIES-2100 (Hirose et al. 2017).",
        "Additionally, the 86 protein sequences with significant \u2018halo-genase\u2019 database hits were also investigated for protein domains using InterProScan (Finn et al. 2017). This confirmed for 84 sequences that they belong to the \u2018Tryptophan halogenase\u2019 pro-tein family (PF04820) and all contained a flavin-TH domain (IPR006905). Only two short protein sequences (S1691 and S1792), which were identified as TH by blastp, did not contain a detectable domain.",
        "Phylogenetic analyses of putative tryptophan halogenases Phylogenetic analyses of the 86 identified putative TH pro-tein sequences resulted in four distinct clades, and only two sequences (S1874 and S2870) did not cluster within these four clades (Fig. 1). Except for A. aerophoba, all analyzed sponge species contained halogenases from all four phyloge-netic clades. The largest clade (Clade 1) contained 30 sequences, followed by Clade 4 (25 sequences), Clade 3 (19 sequences) and Clade 2 (10 sequences).",
        "Only one species-specific halogenase clade could be identi-fied, namely an A. lacunosa-specific subclade within Clade 2 (7 out of 10 sequences; Fig. 1). The sequences within this subclade were all most closely related to a TH from a Dehalococcoidales bacterium (A0A2E9M8J4). Within Clade 3 (19 sequences), the halogenase most abundant (88%) in A. aerophoba (S1779) was closely related to a putative halogenase sequence (K7XJ2) pre-viously detected in Mediterranean C. crambe as well as to a halogenase from Psychrobacter sp. D8 isolated from the same sponge (O\u0308ztu\u0308rk et al. 2013). Especially Clade 4 (25 sequences) was only distantly related to previously reported halogenases from Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria and contained mainly sequences from Caribbean Aplysina spp., indicating a large num-ber of novel halogenases within these sponges and their micro-biota. The well-characterized flavin-dependent TH gene prod-ucts RebH (L. aerocolonigenes, Q8KHZ8; Yeh et al. 2007) and PrnA (P. fluorescens, P95480; Dong et al. 2005) clustered outside the sponge-derived clades and were closely related to only one not abundant (<1%) sequence from A. aerophoba (S2870).

        "Prominent sponge symbionts are potential halogenase producers In an attempt to predict the potential bacterial producers of the detected halogenase genes, we correlated the relative abun-dances of the four 16S rRNA gene OTUs and the 85 puta-tive halogenases shared by the Caribbean Aplysina species. We hypothesized that the shared halogenases are produced by bac-teria that can be found amongst the shared bacterial taxa in the different sponge species. Furthermore, an increased rela-tive abundance of the producers is expected to be reflected in an increased number of detected halogenase genes. Two halo-genases (S0310 and S3275) were most highly correlated with sponge-associated Chloroflexi (Otu0069 and Otu0228, respec-tively; Fig. 3). These clades include predominant sponge sym-bionts with the genomic repertoire for chemical defense (Slaby et al. 2017; Bayer et al. 2018). Chloroflexi were previously found to contain halogenases (Bayer et al. 2013) and were linked to the production of brominated compounds in A. aerophoba (Sacrista\u0301n-Soriano et al. 2011, Sacrista\u0301n-Soriano, Banaigs and Becerro 2016). We furthermore detected strong correlation of a halogenase sequence to a Nitrospinae OTU, however little is known about this taxon in sponges to date. Nonetheless, Nitro-spinae are closely related to the candidate phylum Tectomicro-bia, which occurs in Aplysina species (Chaib De Mares et al. 2018) and of which some members are renowned for their large sec-ondary metabolism gene repertoire (Wilson et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2017).",
        "One highly predominant cyanobacterial OTU was present in all Caribbean species and was not significantly correlated to halogenases in this study, adding to the hypothesis that the role of Cyanobacteria in sponge-microbe symbioses of high micro-bial abundance sponges might be mainly related to nutrient production rather than chemical defense (Freeman et al. 2013; Burgsdorf et al. 2015). In low microbial abundance sponges, how-ever, the production of brominated metabolites has been linked to cyanobacterial symbionts (Unson, Holland and Faulkner, 1994; Flatt et al. 2005). Thus, our results support previous find-ings and for the first time indicate potential microbial producers of brominated compounds found in Caribbean Aplysina species. However, further studies, including comparative and functinoal genomics of sponge symbionts, are necessary to reliably link halogenated compound production to their microbial producers.",
        "CONCLUSION The plethora of previously undescribed putative flavin-dependent THs from the metagenomic DNA of Mediterranean and Caribbean Aplysina species unraveled here indicates a large potential for the discovery of novel halogenating enzymes from these marine invertebrates and their associated microbiomes. The separation into four phylogenetically distinct clades of halogenase protein sequences indicates that multiple classes of organic scaffolds may be halogenated by sponge-associated microbes. High bacterial diversity was in most cases indica-tive of a high halogenase diversity, and while the Caribbean species shared many halogenases as well as bacterial OTUs, the Mediterranean A. aerophoba could be clearly distinguished. Based on co-occurrence, three prominent bacterial sponge symbionts belonging to the Chloroflexi and Nitrospinae were identified as potential sources of abundant halogenases. These results may thus contribute to explaining the origin of the numerous halogenated compounds discovered in Aplysina species.",
