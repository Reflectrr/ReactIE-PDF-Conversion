Purification and Characterization of a Novel Methyltransferase Responsible for Biosynthesis of Halomethanes and Methanethiol in Brassica oleracea* (Received for publication, October 6, 1994, and in revised form, January 27, 1995) Jihad M. Attieh, Andrew D. Hansonz, and Hargurdeep S. Saini\u00a7 From the Institut de recherche en biologie uegetale, Unioersite de Montreal, 4101 rue Sherbrooke est, Montreal, Quebec H1X 2B2, Canada A novel S-adenosyl-L-methionine:halide/bisulfide methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-) was purified approxi-mately lOOO-fold to apparent homogeneity from leaves of Brassica oleracea, The enzyme catalyzed the S-adeno-syl-L-methionine-dependent methylation of the halides iodide, bromide, and chloride to monohalomethanes and of bisulfide to methanethiol. The dual function of the enzyme was demonstrated through co-purification of the halide-and bisulfide-methylating activities in the same ratio and by studies of competition between the alternative substrates iodide and bisulfide. The purifi-cation procedure included gel filtration, anion exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography on aden-oslne-agarose. Elution of the protein from a chromato-focusing column indicated a pI value of 4.8. The pH optimum of halide methylation (5.5-7.0) was different from that of bisulfide methylation (7.0-8.0). The molec-ular mass values for the native and denatured protein were 29.5 and 28 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the active enzyme is a monomer. The enzyme had the high-est specificity constant for iodide and the next highest for bisulfide. Substrate interaction kinetics and product inhibition patterns were consistent with an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism. Interest in trace gas emissions has increased over the last two decades following the realization of their impact on atmo-spheric chemistry (1). Halogen-and sulfur-containing organic gases have attracted particular attention because of their re-spective effects on the integrity of stratospheric ozone (2) and the formation of acid rain (3). Biological activity in the oceans is commonly viewed as a major source of organohalogen (4, 5) and organosulfur emis-sions (6, 7). Terrestrial microorganisms, fungi, and a few higher plants also emit these gases (8, 9). The biochemical bases for these emissions, however, remain poorly understood. Possible mechanisms involve spontaneous (10) or enzymatic (11, 12) reactions. A haloperoxidase-mediated incorporation of halides into a carbon skeleton was suggested as the main route for halomethane biosynthesis (11) but has never been actually shown to produce monohalomethanes. Subsequently, an enzy-* This work was supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and Fonds pour la Formation de Chercheurs et l'Aide a la Recherche, Quebec (to A.

Recently, it was reported (15) that a methyl chloride transferase from the marine red alga Endocladia muricata could carry out the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)! to a halide (X-) as follows. X-+ AdoMet --CH3X + AdoHcy REACTION 1 Preliminary evidence was also presented for a similar activ-ity in a wood-rotting fungus, Phellinus pomaceus, and a halo-phytic higher plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. Methanethiol was originally thought to come from methio-nine via a methioninase (t-methionine methanethiol-Iyase) re-action (12). However, the observation that several bacterial isolates from soil and agricultural crops as well as cultures of marine algae evolved CHaSH in the presence of bisulfide (HS-) suggested that this gas may also be produced via a different mechanism (16). Thiol methyltransferases, capable of cata-lyzing the following reaction, were later found in a variety of organisms including bacteria (16), algae (17), and mammals (18, 19). HS-+ AdoMet --CH3SH + AdoHcy REACTION 2 A survey of higher plants done in our laboratory (20) showed that many diverse species produce CHaI when supplied with r, and CHaSH when supplied with HS-, in a manner similar to Reactions 1 and 2. The levels of the two activities were highly correlated among species. Plants from the family Brassicaceae exhibited some of the highest rates of CH3I and CHaSH pro-duction. To elucidate the biochemical basis for these environ-mentally important gas emissions, we developed an easy and reliable assay for their quantitation and proceeded to purify and characterize the halide-and bisulfide-methylating activities. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plant Material Plants ofBrassica oleracea cv.April Red were grown in a greenhouse under a photoperiod of at least 12 h and were watered and fertilized as necessary. The two most expanded basal leaves of 3-month-old plants were used for enzyme extraction. 1 The abbreviations used are: AdoMet,S-adenosyl-L-methionine; X-, halide ion; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine; TEMED, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine; HPLC, high performance liquid chroma-tography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)aminoJ-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-l,3-diol. 9250 This is an Open Access article under theCC BY Halide / Bisulfide Methyltransferase from B. oleracea 9251 Chemicals S-Adenosyl-L-methionine was from Boehringer Mannheim. The inor-ganic phosphorus test kit, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, 5'-ADP-agarose, KI, KBr, and KCI were purchased from Sigma. Ammonium sulfide and authentic CH3SH, CH3Br, and CH31 were obtained from Aldrich. Au-thentic CH 3CI was purchased from Liquid Carbonic (Scarborough, On-tario, Canada). Sephadex G-100, Sephadex G-25, gel filtration calibra-tion kit, and Polybuffer 74 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was purchased from New England Bio-labs (Beverly, MA). The protein dye reagent, TEMED, ammonium per-sulfate, and bisacrylamide were all from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, On-tario, Canada). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Buffers The buffers used were as follows: 100 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol (v/v) and 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A); 25 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol and 14 mM 2-mer-captoethanol (buffer B); 25 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, containing 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer C); buffer C with 100 mMNaCI (buffer D); 25 mM BisTris/iminodiacetic acid, pH 7.0 (buffer E); and Polybuffer 74/ iminodiacetic acid (1:10, vlv), pH 4.0 (buffer F). All buffers were filtered before use through a 0.22-p.m membrane. Measurement of Halide / Bisulfide Methyltransferase Activity Enzyme Assay-Since I-was the preferred substrate among halides, it was used as the halide substrate throughout the purification proce-dure. The enzyme activity was assayed in a 1-ml mixture containing 0.5 mM AdoMet, 50 mM KI (halide methylation), or 20 mM (NH.)2S (bisul-fide methylation) all prepared in buffer A. Enzyme preparations con-taining up to 200 p.g of protein were used to start the reaction. The mixture was incubated in a 5-ml glass vial sealed with a screw cap fitted with a Teflon-lined septum (Supelco, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and maintained on an orbital shaker (150 rpm) at room temperature. The reaction rate was linear for at least 45 min at all enzyme and substrate concentrations. A standard incubation time of 30 min was adopted. Gas Chromatography-The products formed were analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector. One-ml headspace samples were injected in a 210 x 0.3-cm stainless steel column packed with 80/100-mesh Porapak Q (Supelco) in a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph. Column temperatures were 160\u00b0C for CH31 and CH3Br, 145\u00b0C for CH3SH, and 130\u00b0C for CH 3CI. The carrier gas (helium, ultrapure) flow rate was 40 mllmin. The column was purged by heating to 200\u00b0C between injections. Products were quanti-fied by peak area and identified by comparison of their retention times with those of authentic methyl halides or CH3SH, which were used to calibrate the instrument. Recoveries of 75 nl of CH 31 and 28 nl of CH 3SH injected to vials containing the assay mixture were 69 and 87%, respectively, after 30 min. The data presented here were not corrected for recoveries. The identity of CH 31 and CH3SH in the headspace of enzyme assays was confirmed by mass spectrometry using a KRATOS MS 50 mass spectrometer operated in the electron impact mode. Protein Estimation Total soluble proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (21) using the Bio-Rad protein reagent, following the microassay pro-cedure, and using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Preparation ofAdenosine-Agarose Affinity Gel 5'-ADP-agarose (4 ml) was washed under vacuum according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated with 800 units of calf intes-tinal alkaline phosphatase and 5 ml of calf intestinal alkaline phospha-tase buffer (1 X), pH 7.5, in a total volume of 9 ml. The gel was dephosphorylated overnight at 37\u00b0C in a continuously rotating reaction vial, transferred to a column, washed with 10 ml of buffer C containing 2 MNaCl, and washed again with 20 ml of buffer C alone. The washing was done in fractions of -10 ml, which were subsequently assayed for phosphate content. The dephosphorylation reaction was repeated until no more phosphate was detected. The gel was washed with an excess of deionized water before each reaction. Free phosphate was determined colorimetrically with the method of Fiske and Subbarow (22). Purification of Halide / Bisulfide Methyltransferase Extraction-All manipulations were carried out at 4 \u00b0C unless stated otherwise. Halide-and HS--methylating activities were monitored si-multaneously throughout the purification procedure. Generally, 1 kg of freshly harvested leaves were cut into small squares, immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen, and then homogenized with buffer A (1:3, w/v) and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (10%, w/w) for 5 min in a blender at full speed. The homogenate was filtered through eight layers of cheese-cloth and centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 X g. The supernatant (crude extract) was recovered, and enzyme activity and protein concentration were assayed in an aliquot desalted by passage through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia). The crude extract was fractionated with solid (NH.)2S0., and the proteins that precipitated between 60 and 85% saturation, containing halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities, were re-covered by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min. Gel Filtration on Sephadex G\u00b7lOG-The pellet from the 60-85% (NH.)2S0. fraction was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer B and applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (2.6 x 90 em) that had been previously equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with buffer B at 25 mllh, and 2-ml fractions were collected. The active fractions from this step were pooled and concentrated by diafiltration in a stirred Amicon cell fitted with a YM-30 membrane (Amicon, Danvers, MA). Affinity Chromatography on Adenosine\u00b7Agarose-The concentrated sample was applied to an adenosine-agarose column (1.5 x 3 em) that had been previously equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed at a constant flow rate of 10 mllh with 15 ml of buffer B, followed by 8 ml of the same buffer containing 300 mM(NH.)2S0\u2022. The salt was then removed by washing the column with buffer B. The halide-and bisulfide-methylating activities were recovered by elution with a 40-ml linear gradient of 0-4 mM AdoMet in buffer B. One-ml fractions were collected and assayed for activity and protein content. The halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities eluted between 2 and 3 mMAdoMet. The remaining bound proteins were washed off the column with 2 M NaCl in buffer B; no methyltransferase activity was detected in this fraction. Anion Exchange on Protein Pak Q-Active eluate from the affinity step was submitted to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Millipore, Milford, MA) on a 1 x 10-cm Protein Pak Q anion exchange column (Millipore) equilibrated with buffer C. The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 mllmin, a,,:j the column was washed with the same buffer until no further rV-',osorbing material was eluted. Enzyme activity was then eluted Wi' 11 NaCl in buffer C in a two-step linear gradient of 0-200 mM in 80 min and 200-500 mMin 20 min, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. Gel Filtration on Superdex 75-The fraction containing the first peak of halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activity from the previous step was loaded on an HPLC Superdex 75 gel filtration column (1 x 30 em) (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with buffer D. Proteins were eluted in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 mllmin, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. At this level of purification the halide and bisulfide methyl-transferase p;,-paration was apparently free from contaminating proteins. Chromatofocusing An enzyme preparation from the Sephadex G-100 gel filtration step was subjected to HPLC chromatofocusing on a Mono P HR (5/20) col-umn (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with buffer E. Unbound pro-teins were removed by washing the column with the same buffer. Enzyme activity was then eluted with a pH gradient of 7.0-4.0 gener-ated with 45 ml of buffer F at a flow rate of 1 mllmin. One-rnl fractions were collected in 0.2 ml of 500 mMTris acetate buffer, pH 7.7, contain-ing 50% glycerol. Molecular Weight Determination Molecular weight of the native halidelbisulfide methyltransferase was determined by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column (2.5 x 44 em) calibrated with the following markers: ribonuclease A (M r 13,700), chymotrypsinogen A (Mr 25,000), ovalbumin (Mr 43,000), and albumin (Mr 67,000). The column void volume was determined with blue dextran 2000. Buffer B was used for column equilibration and elution. One-ml samples were applied to the column, which was operated at a flow rate of 20 mllh. In order to achieve better resolution, column calibration was done in two steps, the first involving ribonuclease A and ovalbumin and the second involving albumin and chymotrypsinogen A. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Proteins from different purification steps were separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions (23) using 12% acrylamide gels. Gels were stained with silver nitrate or Coomassie Blue. The molecular mass of the denatured enzyme was determined from a plot of log molecular mass against the migration distance of standard proteins. 9252 Halide / Bisulfide Methyltransferase from B. oleracea T ABLE I Purifi cation of halideIbisulfide methyltransferase Total activity\" Specific activity CHallCHaSH Purifi cat ion RecoveryStep Total protein CHal CHaSH CHaI CHaSH Rati o CHaI CHaSH CHaI CHaSH microkatals mg microkatals Img -tua % Crude extract 39.2 28.6 4276 .0 0.009 0.007 1.37 1 1 100 100 85% (NH.)2S0 . 31.2 26.4 860.5 0.036 0.031 1.18 4.0 4.43 79.7 92.3 G-100 16.6 11.8 300.7 0.055 0.039 1.41 6.11 5.57 42.5 41.1 Adeno-agarose 8.3 7.1 0.722 11.5 9.834 1.17 1278 1405 21.3 24.7 PP-Q peak 1 0.61 0.47 0.041 14.88 11.46 1.29 1653 1637 1.55 1.65 Superdex 75 0.12 0.105 0.0135 9.231 8.077 1.14 1025 1154 0.3 0.36 a One katal ofhalidelbisulfide methyltransferase is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 mol ofsubstrate/s under the assay conditions. A B c D E F G Determination of Kinetic Properties The kinetic propert ies of the halidelbisulfide methyltransferase were determined using a preparation purified through a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration step. Alternative substrate competition experiments were performed by varying the concentration of one substrate at each ofa series ofconcen-trations of the other. The concentration of AdoMet was kept constant at 0.5 mxi. Data were presented as double-reciprocal plots of initial veloc-ity (v) versus varying substrate (S) concentrations. Substrate interaction studies were done by fixing the concentration of one substrate while changing that of the other. Linear regressions were fitted to the data in double-reciprocal plots. Replots of the data were used to determine the kinetic parameters. RESULTS B. oleracea leaf extracts catalyzed the AdoMet-dependent methyl trans fer to X-or HS-. The enzyme respons ible for both of the reactions was puri fied to homogeneity, and its du al functio n was demonstrated . Purification ofHalide/ Bisulfide Methyltransferase-The en-zyme was extracted from B. oleracea by subjecting leaf tissue to a freeze-thaw cycle pri or to homogenization and was purified using (NH4)2S0 4 precipitation followed by gel filtration chro -matography on Sephadex G-100 , affinity chromatography on adenosine-agaro se , and HPLC on Protein Pak Q an ion ex-change and Superdex 75 gel filtration columns. Th e specific activity of th e enzyme was enriched more than 1000-fold over the crude preparation with a recovery of 0.35%. Table I sum-marizes the purification procedure, and Fig. 1 shows a typical pattern of protein s from various purification ste ps separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blu e. Affinity chromatography on adenosi ne-agarose was efficient in removing most of the conta mina ting proteins (Fig. 2). Fur-the r purificat ion was achi eved by anion excha nge HPLC, which resolved four peak s of halidelbisulfide meth yltransferase activ-ity (Fig. 3). The first and la rgest peak of activity eluting from this column contained only two proteins as see n on the SDS gel (Fig. 1). Further purificat ion of th is peak by HPLC on a Super-dex 75 gel filt ration column reso lved two protein peak s, only one of which contained halidelbisulfide-methylating activity. This peak appeared free of contam inants whe n visualized on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Th e Superd ex-pu rified halidelbisulfide meth yltrans ferase migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecu lar mass of 28,000 daltons. Since this is close to the value of29,500 determined for the nat ive protein on a G-lOO gel filtration column, th e active enzyme probably exists as a monomer . Demonstrat ion of Dual Activity-The halide and bisulfide meth yltransferase activities co-purified to homogeneity in th e same ratio (1.26 :t 0.14) during a five-step procedure (Table I, Figs. 2 and 3). Moreover, doubl e-reciprocal plots of th e data from competition kinetics betw een the halide and bisulfide substrates gave regression lin es that intersected at the 11v axis (Fig. 4, A and B ).

Effect of pH on Halide / Bisulfide Methyltra nsferase-The ha-lidelbisulfide methyltransferase activity was assayed over a wide range of pH, using buffers with overla pping ranges. The pH optimum for I-methylation was fairly broad, bet ween 5.5 and 7.0 (Fig. 5A), whereas that for HS -methylation was sharper and more alkaline, betw een 7.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 5B) . In addit ion, halidelbisulfide methyltran sferase activity eluted at pH 4.8 upon chromatofocusing on a Mono P column, suggesti ng that th e enzyme has a pI value of 4.8 :t 0.2. Enzyme Stability-After Sephadex G-lOO gel filtration, the en-zyme was stabl e for over 2 months at -80 \u00b0C in buffer B. After affinity chromatography, the halidelbisulfide methyltransferase became extremely labile, losing all activity after overnight storage at -80 \u00b0C. Addition of 20% glycerol to the preparation and storage at -20 \u00b0C conserved 12%of the activity after 48 h. In contrast, after the Protein Pak Qanion exchange ste p, the enzyme retained more than 70% of its activity after 24 h and 55% after 48 h at 4 \u00b0C in buffer C containing 175 mMNaC!. Kinetic A nalysis S ubstrate Interaction Kinetics-Double-reciprocal plots with I-as the va riable substrate at seve ral fixed concentrations of AdoMet gave converging lin es (Fig. 6A). The sa me pattern was observed when HS -was the va riable substrate at different fixed concentrations of AdoMet (Fig. 6B).

S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine was a competitive inhibi-tor with respect to AdoMet (Fig. 7A) and noncomp etitive with respect to iodide (Fig. 7B ) or bisulfide (Fig. 7C).

As calculated from replots of the data, the Vmax for the formation of CHsI was 1140 nanokatals/mg of protein; that for CHsSH was 804 nanokatals/mg of protein. The respective K m values for 1-and HS-were 1.3 and 4.7 mM. There were two different K m values for AdoMet depending on the second substrate used, 0.03 mM with 1-and 0.226 mM with HS-. Table II summarizes the kinetic parameters of the halide/ bisulfide methyltransferase for its different substrates. DISCUSSION The halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities from B. oleracea were purified to apparent homogeneity. The two activities co-purified at a constant ratio (1.26 \u00b1 0.14) throughout the procedure (Table I, Figs. 2 and 3). The kinet-ics of mutual inhibition between the substrates 1-and HS-were characteristic of competitive inhibition (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together, these results establish that both halide-and bisulfide-methylating activities reside on the same active site of a single protein, the halide/bisulfide methyltransferase. The homogeneous protein was obtained through a five-step procedure that resulted in an overall purification of approx-imately 1000-fold with a recovery of 0.35% (Table I). Affinity chromatography on an adenosine-agarose column was the key step, in which the enzyme specifically bound to the ma-trix while most of the contaminating proteins were washed through during sample loading (Fig. 2). The enzyme was selectively eluted with the co-substrate AdoMet in a linear gradient resulting in a 1300-fold increase in the specific 9254 Halide / Bisulfide Methyltransferase from B. oleracea 0.20 [ (NH 4) 2 S] , (roM) 60 A 0A 010 \u2022 \u2022 ca\u00b7x x 0.15 ..... \u2022 oK-\" bl lEI 40 0I ......

Adenosine, linked via its adenine-Cg to agarose (ag-adenosine, Pharmacia), has been successfully used to purify other plant methyltransferases (24, 25). Our adenosine-agarose matrix was highly stable and was repeatedly used without any loss of its binding or eluting efficiencies. Other affinity matrices prepared with either AdoMet or AdoHcy linked via their free amino or carboxyl groups to Affi-Prep 10 (Bio-Rad) or EAH-Sepharose (Pharma-cia) failed to bind the enzyme. High performance liquid chromatography on Protein Pak Q anion exchange column resolved multiple peaks ofhalide/bisul-fide methyltransferase activity (Fig. 3). An enzyme preparation processed through a procedure in which salt precipitation was replaced with polyethylene glycol precipitation also gave mul-tiple peaks in this anion exchange step (not shown).

Interestingly, rat liver thiol methyltransferase, with which the halide/bisulfide meth-yltransferase shares many properties, was reported in five different cellular compartments (26). The harsh freeze-thaw treatment needed to maximize the extraction of halide/bisul-fide methyltransferase was also similar to the procedure used to extract the compartmented rat liver enzyme (18). The protein from a fraction containing peak halide/bisulfide methyltransferase activity from the Superdex 75 step migrated as a single band of 28,000 Da on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Moreover, when consecutive fractions across the first peak of activity after anion exchange HPLC were applied to SDS\u00b7PAGE, the Coo-massie Blue staining intensity of the 28,000-Da protein band peaked in the fraction containing peak enzyme activity (not shown). These observations confirmed that the molecular mass of the denatured halide/bisulfide methyltransferase was 28,000 Da.

The molecular weight of this enzyme was similar to the algal methyl chloride transferase (15) and mammalian thiol methyltransferase (18, 26). The halidelbisulfide methyltransferase exhibited different pH optimum values for its alternative halide (Fig. 5A) and bisulfide (Fig. 5B) substrates. A likely reason for this difference is the pH dependence of the HS-ion concentration. Since H2S has a pKal of7.02 (27), [HS-] would be expected to fall sharply as the pH drops below 7. The halide-and bisulfide-methylating activities had the same pI value at pH 4.8, which was consist-ent with the observation that both activities existed on a single protein. The pattern of substrate interaction kinetics involving AdoMet with either 1-or HS-(Fig. 6, A and B) was sympto-matic of a sequential substrate binding mechanism (28). Prod-uct inhibition kinetics were used to determine the reaction [(NH ,) :I S] -1 (111M) -1 FIG. 6.

Since the inhibition by AdoHcy was com-petitive with respect to AdoMet (Fig. 7A) and noncompetitive with respect to the halide (Fig. 7B) or bisulfide (Fig. 7C) ion (29), AdoMet appears to be the first substrate to bind to the enzyme. The methylated product would be the first to be re-leased and AdoHcy the last. This pattern is indicative of an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism whereby the product of the last substrate to bind to the enzyme is the first to be released (30). To our knowledge, this is the first time that either a halide or a bisulfide methyltransferase enzyme has been purified to ho-mogeneity from a plant. A functionally similar rat liver S-thiol methyltransferase was purified to homogeneity (18). However, we found no reports on any halide methyltransferase from animals. A methyl chloride transferase from E. muricata (15) and a thiol methyltransferase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (19) have been partially purified. Perhaps more importantly, this is the first report, for any organism, of a single enzyme with both halide and bisulfide methyltransferase activities. Our previous work (20) indicates that this dual function en-zyme is common among higher plants and that it may also be present in a marine red alga E. muricata. This may be of environmental importance; on a fresh weight basis, the rate of halomethane production from B. oleracea extracts was at least 6-fold higher than that from extracts of E. muricata (15). The production of CHaSH was of equal abundance to that of CHaI in most cases tested. Most studies on the production of halomethanes and CHaSH have focused on their environmental or ecological significance. For instance, volatile halogenated organic compounds pro-duced by algae have been considered as deterrents to herbivore feeding (31). However, such compounds may also have meta-bolic roles. Thus, CHaCl was found to be a methyl donor in the biosynthesis of veratryl alcohol, a secondary metabolite in-volved in the induction of the lignolytic system in many lignin-degrading fungi including P. pomaceus (32). Harper et al. (33) suggested that these compounds could play a similar role in other organisms, including higher plants. Our finding of the halide methyltransferase activity in a higher plant supports this suggestion. Methanethiol is a product of sulfate reduction by microor-ganisms and plants (34). Many functions of sulfur emissions by plants have been suggested including antimicrobial effects, release of toxic compounds produced in cellular metabolism, and allelopathic effects in plant communities (9). Detoxification of sulfur compounds has been shown in mammals (18, 19) and bacteria (35), and H2S (HS-anion) was the simplest substrate of an S-methylating activity that produced CHaSH (36). Re-cently, dimethyl sulfide was also reported as a product of sul-fate reduction in some phototrophic bacteria (37). The mammalian and bacterial thiol methyltransferases have been reported to methylate organic thiols in addition to HS-ions. To determine whether such compounds can also serve as substrates for the cabbage enzyme, we tested the ability of 2-mercaptoethanol, 6-mercaptopurine, and thiobenzoic acid to inhibit the iodide-methylating activity in an assay containing 10 mMKI. CHaI production was not inhibited by these thiols at concentrations up to 100 mM. The above thiol methyltrans-ferases methylated CHaSH to dimethyl sulfide. However, we did not detect any dimethyl sulfide using CHaSH (15 mM) as the substrate in our assays. These preliminary results suggest that the cabbage enzyme may have a metabolic role different from those reported for the mammalian and bacterial enzymes. Further work to test the activity of this enzyme toward non-volatile substrates in an appropriate phytochemical context is needed to confirm this possibility. It is too early to attribute any specific role to the halide/ bisulfide methyltransferase in B. oleracea, especially given its potential involvement in two different areas of metabolism. However, given the low rates of methylation and the high K m value of the methyltransferase for the only physiologically im-portant halide Cl\", we suggest that this enzyme is more likely to function in sulfur metabolism than in that of halide ions. This role in sulfur metabolism is also favored because the Brassicaceae family is characterized by several sulfur-contain-ing secondary metabolites, including non-protein sulfur-con-taining amino acids (38) and sulfur-containing glucosinolates (39, 40). Hydrolysis products of these latter compounds react with CHaSH to produce a variety ofphytoalexins (40) that are involved in defense responses of this family. Acknowledgments-We thank Dr. Ragai K.

        "A novel S-adenosyl-L-methionine:halide/bisulfide methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-) was purified approxi-mately lOOO-fold to apparent homogeneity from leaves of Brassica oleracea, The enzyme catalyzed the S-adeno-syl-L-methionine-dependent methylation of the halides iodide, bromide, and chloride to monohalomethanes and of bisulfide to methanethiol. The dual function of the enzyme was demonstrated through co-purification of the halide-and bisulfide-methylating activities in the same ratio and by studies of competition between the alternative substrates iodide and bisulfide. The purifi-cation procedure included gel filtration, anion exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography on aden-oslne-agarose. Elution of the protein from a chromato-focusing column indicated a pI value of 4.8. The pH optimum of halide methylation (5.5-7.0) was different from that of bisulfide methylation (7.0-8.0). The molec-ular mass values for the native and denatured protein were 29.5 and 28 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the active enzyme is a monomer. The enzyme had the high-est specificity constant for iodide and the next highest for bisulfide. Substrate interaction kinetics and product inhibition patterns were consistent with an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism.",
        "Interest in trace gas emissions has increased over the last two decades following the realization of their impact on atmo-spheric chemistry (1). Halogen-and sulfur-containing organic gases have attracted particular attention because of their re-spective effects on the integrity of stratospheric ozone (2) and the formation of acid rain (3).",
        "Biological activity in the oceans is commonly viewed as a major source of organohalogen (4, 5) and organosulfur emis-sions (6, 7). Terrestrial microorganisms, fungi, and a few higher plants also emit these gases (8, 9). The biochemical bases for these emissions, however, remain poorly understood. Possible mechanisms involve spontaneous (10) or enzymatic (11, 12) reactions. A haloperoxidase-mediated incorporation of halides into a carbon skeleton was suggested as the main route for halomethane biosynthesis (11) but has never been actually shown to produce monohalomethanes.

        "Most studies on the production of halomethanes and CHaSH have focused on their environmental or ecological significance. For instance, volatile halogenated organic compounds pro-duced by algae have been considered as deterrents to herbivore feeding (31). However, such compounds may also have meta-bolic roles. Thus, CHaCl was found to be a methyl donor in the biosynthesis of veratryl alcohol, a secondary metabolite in-volved in the induction of the lignolytic system in many lignin-degrading fungi including P. pomaceus (32). Harper et al. (33) suggested that these compounds could play a similar role in other organisms, including higher plants. Our finding of the halide methyltransferase activity in a higher plant supports this suggestion.",
        "Methanethiol is a product of sulfate reduction by microor-ganisms and plants (34). Many functions of sulfur emissions by plants have been suggested including antimicrobial effects, release of toxic compounds produced in cellular metabolism, and allelopathic effects in plant communities (9). Detoxification of sulfur compounds has been shown in mammals (18, 19) and bacteria (35), and H2S (HS-anion) was the simplest substrate of an S-methylating activity that produced CHaSH (36). Re-cently, dimethyl sulfide was also reported as a product of sul-fate reduction in some phototrophic bacteria (37).",
        "The mammalian and bacterial thiol methyltransferases have been reported to methylate organic thiols in addition to HS-ions. To determine whether such compounds can also serve as substrates for the cabbage enzyme, we tested the ability of 2-mercaptoethanol, 6-mercaptopurine, and thiobenzoic acid to inhibit the iodide-methylating activity in an assay containing 10 mMKI. CHaI production was not inhibited by these thiols at concentrations up to 100 mM. The above thiol methyltrans-ferases methylated CHaSH to dimethyl sulfide. However, we did not detect any dimethyl sulfide using CHaSH (15 mM) as the substrate in our assays. These preliminary results suggest that the cabbage enzyme may have a metabolic role different from those reported for the mammalian and bacterial enzymes. Further work to test the activity of this enzyme toward non-volatile substrates in an appropriate phytochemical context is needed to confirm this possibility.",
        "It is too early to attribute any specific role to the halide/ bisulfide methyltransferase in B. oleracea, especially given its potential involvement in two different areas of metabolism. However, given the low rates of methylation and the high K m value of the methyltransferase for the only physiologically im-portant halide Cl\", we suggest that this enzyme is more likely to function in sulfur metabolism than in that of halide ions. This role in sulfur metabolism is also favored because the Brassicaceae family is characterized by several sulfur-contain-ing secondary metabolites, including non-protein sulfur-con-taining amino acids (38) and sulfur-containing glucosinolates (39, 40). Hydrolysis products of these latter compounds react with CHaSH to produce a variety ofphytoalexins (40) that are involved in defense responses of this family.",
