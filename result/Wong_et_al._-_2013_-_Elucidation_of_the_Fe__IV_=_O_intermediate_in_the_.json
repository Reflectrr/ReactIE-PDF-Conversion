Solomon1,7 Mononuclear non-haem iron (NHFe) enzymes catalyse a broad range of oxidative reactions, including halogenation, hydroxyla-tion, ring closure, desaturation and aromatic ring cleavage reac-tions. They are involved in a number of biological processes, including phenylalanine metabolism, the production of neuro-transmitters, the hypoxic response and the biosynthesis of second-ary metabolites1\u20133. The reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycles of these enzymes is a high-spin S 5 2 Fe(IV)5O species, which has been trapped for a number of NHFe enzymes4\u20138, including the halogenase SyrB2 (syringomycin biosynthesis enzyme 2). Com-putational studies aimed at understanding the reactivity of this Fe(IV)5O intermediate9\u201313 are limited in applicability owing to the paucity of experimental knowledge about its geometric and electronic structure. Synchrotron-based nuclear resonance vibra-tional spectroscopy (NRVS) is a sensitive and effective method that defines the dependence of the vibrational modes involving Fe on the nature of the Fe(IV)5O active site14\u201316. Here we present NRVS structural characterization of the reactive Fe(IV)5O intermediate of a NHFe enzyme, namely the halogenase SyrB2 from the bac-terium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. This intermediate reacts via an initial hydrogen-atom abstraction step, performing subsequent halogenation of the native substrate or hydroxylation of non-native substrates17. A correlation of the experimental NRVS data to electronic structure calculations indicates that the substrate directs the orientation of the Fe(IV)5O intermediate, presenting specific frontier molecular orbitals that can activate either selective halogenation or hydroxylation. SyrB2, an a-ketoglutarate (aKG)-dependent NHFe enzyme found in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, halogenates the methyl group of L-threonine (L-Thr) using non-ribosomal peptide synthetase machinery18. The Fe(II) active site is ligated by two histidines and one halide (Cl\u2013 or Br\u2013) (see Supplementary Fig. 1)19, in contrast to the two-histidine/one-carboxylate \u2018facial triad\u2019 of other NHFe enzymes1,2,4,5,8. Although the mechanisms of O2 activation leading to the highly-reactive S 5 2 Fe(IV)5O intermediate are thought to be similar for allaKG-dependent NHFe enzymes, there is a notable divergence in their subsequent cata-lytic cycles (Fig. 1). The Fe(IV)5O species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to form an Fe(III)\u2013OH species and a substrate radical; in hydroxylases, the subsequent step is HON rebound to form a hydro-xylated product1,2, but in SyrB2 the native L-Thr substrate is chlorinated instead, and the 4-Cl-L-Thr product is used in the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin syringomycin E18. Owing to their reactivity, Fe(IV)5O intermediates in enzyme reactions are challenging to trap and char-acterize. For SyrB2, however, use of the non-native substrate L-cyclopropylglycine (L-Cpg) and the heterologous substrate carrier protein CytC2 has provided a long-lived species at the concentrations required for spectroscopic investigation17,20. Nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) utilizes third-generation synchrotron radiation to probe the vibrational sidebands of the 57Fe Mo\u0308ssbauer nuclear resonance peak at 14.4 keV (refs 21\u201323). NRVS is a site-selective technique allowing the observation of only normal modes involving Fe motion, which makes it ideal for studying iron-dependent enzymes without interference from protein backbone modes. (SyrB2)Fe(IV)5O can be generated in high purity with both Cl\u2013 and Br\u2013 ligation of the Fe(IV)5O unit, providing a mass perturba-tion that aids in the assignment of NRVS peaks and ultimately the structure of the intermediate. The NRVS methodology is coupled with spectroscopically calibrated density functional theory (DFT) calcula-tions to evaluate specific frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) responsible for hydrogen-atom abstraction that can selectively lead to halogenation or hydroxylation, depending on the substrate. In Fig. 2 we show the NRVS partial vibrational density-of-states (PVDOS) spectra of (SyrB2)Cl\u2013Fe(IV)5O with L-Cpg\u2013S\u2013CytC2 bound (referred to as SyrB2\u2013Cl) and the bromide analogue, (SyrB2)Br\u2013 Fe(IV)5O with L-Cpg\u2013S\u2013CytC2 bound (SyrB2\u2013Br). For practical rea-sons (see Methods), data collection was restricted to ,600 cm\u20131; modes in this region are affected by large (Cl versus Br; see below) but not small (16O versus 18O; see Supplementary Fig. 2) mass perturbations. There are three distinct features for each species, as indicated by the bracketed energy regions: region 1 (340\u2013400 cm\u20131), region 2 (285\u2013340 cm\u20131) and region 3 (200\u2013285 cm\u20131).

All rights peaks of SyrB2\u2013Cl are more intense. However, for the low-energy region 3, the peak envelope for SyrB2\u2013Br is considerably more intense and shifted to lower energy. Previous computational studies of the Cl\u2013Fe(IV)5O intermediate of SyrB2 predicted six-coordinate structures with the succinate bound as a bidentate ligand to Fe (refs 9\u201312). The DFT-calculated NRVS spectra of these six-coordinate structures (Supplementary Fig. 3) do not repro-duce the splitting pattern and intensity distribution of the experi-mental data, and can thus be eliminated from consideration. To generate and evaluate suitable structural candidates, the O2 reac-tion coordinate taking SyrB2 to its Fe(IV)5O intermediate (Fig. 1) was investigated using DFT calculations. The initial structure was taken from the crystal structure of the SyrB2 Fe(II) active site with the aKG cofactor and Cl\u2013 bound (Supplementary Fig. 1)19 and the native sub-strate L-Thr positioned according to a molecular docking procedure12; its side chain was also modified into the non-native substrate L-Cpg to generate a second starting structure. Application of the spectroscopi-cally calibrated DFT methodology used for a related aKG-dependent mononuclear NHFe enzyme24 resulted in an equivalent O2 reaction coordinate for the Fe(II) active site of SyrB2 (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5a, b). This O2 reaction coordinate leads to 1Cpg\u2013Cl (Fig. 3b) and 1Thr\u2013Cl (Supplementary Fig. 5b) with L-Cpg and L-Thr respectively; both are five-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) Fe(IV)5O structures pos-sessing an axial oxo group and a monodentate succinate. Significantly, in both cases, the Fe\u2013oxo vector is oriented perpendicularly to the target substrate C\u2013H bond, with interesting implications forp-channel reactivity25,26. 1Cpg\u2013Cl was evaluated as a structural candidate for the Fe(IV)5O intermediate in the NRVS sample. The geometry-optimized Fe\u2013oxo and Fe\u2013Cl bond lengths (Fig. 3b) of 1Cpg\u2013Cl are in close agreement with the experimental extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) values (1.66 A\u030a and 2.31 A\u030a respectively)7. The Br\u2013 cognate, 1Cpg\u2013Br, was generated by replacing Cl \u2013 with Br\u2013 and reoptimizing the structure; its Fe\u2013Br bond length of 2.45 A\u030a (Fig. 3b) agrees well with the EXAFS value of 2.43 A\u030a for the related halogenase CytC3 (ref. 6). Thus, these five-coordinate TBP intermediates 1Cpg\u2013X (X 5 Cl or Br) resulting from the O2 reaction coordinate were used for comparison with the experimental NRVS data on the SyrB2 Fe(IV)5O intermedi-ates SyrB2\u2013X. As seen in Fig. 3, the five-coordinate TBP species 1Cpg\u2013X result in DFT-predicted spectra that reproduce the experimental spectra. First, there are three distinct peaks falling within the energy regions of 200\u2013 285 cm\u20131, 285\u2013340 cm\u20131 and 340\u2013400 cm\u20131, matching regions 3, 2 and 1 in Fig. 2. Second, the intensities of the peaks in the two higher-energy regions are greater for 1Cpg\u2013Cl than for 1Cpg\u2013Br, and the intensity of the peak envelope in the lowest-energy region for 1Cpg\u2013Br is greater and shifted to lower energy with respect to that of 1Cpg\u2013Cl, repro-ducing the spectral intensity distributions of the experimental data (Fig. 2). Other five-and six-coordinate structures were generated as possible candidates for the Fe(IV)5O species, starting from 1Cpg\u2013X and shifting either the Fe-ligating atoms or the hydrogen-bonding network to the oxo group (Supplementary Fig. 6). From the predicted NRVS spectra of these structures and of the structures generated in previous (computational) studies (Supplementary Fig. 3), all structures except five-coordinate TBP can be eliminated owing to their poor agreement with the experimental NRVS data. Correlating the DFT-calculated spectra of five-coordinate TBP 1Cpg\u2013X (Fig. 3) with the experimental spectra (Fig. 2), the NRVS peaks can be assigned to four normal modes (Fig. 4): the feature in region 1 (Fig. 2) originates from the Fe\u2013succinate stretch; the feature in region 2 is composed of a pair of trans-axial bending modes (these would be degenerate in strict TBP symmetry, but are calculated to split in energy because of the wider equatorial X\u2013Fe\u2013succinate angle of 143u)15; the  2 0.51  1.5 100 200 300 400 500 0P V D O S  (10\u2013 2  cm ) a  0\u03bdFe=O (cm\u20131) Fe\u2014X (\u00c5)2.30 Fe=O (\u00c5)1.66 143\u00baX\u2014Fe\u2014Osucc 824 Cl Br Arg 254Glu 102Thr 143X L-Cpg Succinate Oxo Fe His 235His 116b 2.45 1.66 143\u00ba 825 Energy (cm\u20131) CO2 H2O 1Cpg\u2013Cl 1Cpg\u2013Br% % 200 \u2013 285285 \u2013 340340 \u2013 40012.7 23.8 41.1 15.4 26.6 32.8 E (cm\u20131) Figure 3 | Computational spectra and structure of five-coordinate TBP structural candidate 1Cpg\u2013X for the Fe(IV)5O intermediate of SyrB2. a, DFT-predicted PVDOS NRVS spectra.

All rights lowest-energy region 3 has a peak envelope calculated to contain the trans-axial stretch and the Fe\u2013X stretch, with the Fe\u2013Br stretch being lower in energy by 30 cm\u20131 and more intense by 1.5 times. The redis-tribution in intensity is attributed to the mass perturbation of the Br, which has almost no motion in the Fe\u2013X stretching mode and conse-quently induces greater Fe motion in the mode. This Fe motion is borrowed from higher-energy modes, as analysed in Supplementary Fig. 7. The NRVS peak pattern of SyrB2\u2013X parallels that of a crystal-lographically characterized TBP S 5 2 Fe(IV)5O model complex (Supplementary Fig. 8)15, further demonstrating the sensitivity of NRVS to geometric structure. We note that two distinct Fe(IV) species are detected by Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy, differing in quadrupole splitting, DEQ (Supplementary Fig. 9), in each Fe(IV)5O intermediate generated7. A possible explana-tion for this speciation lies in the hydrogen-bonding interactions with the oxo group: 1Cpg\u2013Cl has two (with Arg 254 and H2O), whereas 1Thr\u2013Cl has one (with H2O). Their predicted NRVS spectra are similar (Supplementary Figs 6 and 10a), but their calculated values of DEQ are different, with that of 1Cpg\u2013Cl (\u20130.50 mm s \u20131) being smaller in mag-nitude than that of 1Thr\u2013Cl (\u20130.71 mm s \u20131). Decreasing the number of hydrogen bonds strengthens the Fe\u2013oxo bond, thus increasing the magnitude of (negative)DEQ (Supplementary Fig. 10a and Supplemen-tary Table 1). These calculations suggest that variability in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the oxo group results in Fe(IV) speciation, not some structural difference. For the native L-Thr substrate (starting from the O2-reaction-coordinate-derived Fe(IV)5O species 1Thr\u2013Cl, which has its Fe\u2013oxo vector perpen-dicular to C\u2013H (Supplementary Fig. 5b)) the hydrogen-atom abstraction reactivity was computationally evaluated (Fig. 5). The target C\u2013H approaches in a p-trajectory, transferring an a-electron into the oxo p-FMO, resulting in an Fe(III)\u2013OH first product (1Thr\u2013Fe(III)OH), in which the Fe(III) has spin S 5 5/2. The free-energy barrier DG{ for this p-pathway is 1100.4 kJ mol\u20131, in reasonable agreement with the experi-mental value of 179.4 kJ mol\u20131 (ref. 7). A number of possible explana-tions have been considered for the subsequent ClN rebound17,27; here we show that in this first product, the substrate radical is positioned closer to the Cl than to the OH ligand of Fe(III) (consideration of their ionic radii places Cl 0.5 A\u030a closer than OH), and OH is also stabilized by hydrogen-bonding to succinate (Fig. 5, right). This conformation dis-favours HON rebound but is well oriented for ClN rebound, as observed experimentally with the native substrate. This perpendicular Fe\u2013oxo ori-entation is, for the six-coordinate structures proposed in previous com-putational studies9\u201312, inaccessible via the O2-activation pathway because a bidentate succinate would block the oxo group from reorienting. Evaluation of the reaction coordinate for O\u2013O cleavage leading to the Fe(IV)5O species (Supplementary Fig. 5) revealed that the posi-tioning of L-Thr is fixed by two hydrogen-bonding interactions (\u2013OH and \u2013NH3 1) to Glu 102. This configuration results in the perpendic-ular orientation of the Fe(IV)\u2013oxo vector relative to the substrate C\u2013H bond. However, the alternative substrate L-norvaline (L-Nva) lacks the \u2013OH group, and thus its \u2013NH3 1 group can rotate to form a hydrogen bond with the O\u2013O (peroxy) bridge, leading to a structure with an Fe\u2013oxo vector oriented towards the substrate C\u2013H bond (Supplemen-tary Fig. 5c). An analogous L-Thr orientation was thus generated to evaluate its hydrogen-atom abstraction trajectory while maintaining the same C\u2013H bond (Fig. 5, left). For this orientation, the C\u2013H approaches the Fe\u2013oxo unit in a s-trajectory, transferring an a-electron into the oxo s-FMO to give an Fe(III)\u2013OH product in which the Fe(III) has spin S 5 5/2; this s-pathway has aDG{ of 170.2 kJ mol\u20131 (Fig. 5). Relative to thep-path-way Fe(III)\u2013OH product, this Fe(III)\u2013OH has the substrate radical closer to the OH ligand than the Cl (by 0.5 A\u030a, based on ionic radii), and OH has no hydrogen-bonding partner. The parallel Fe\u2013oxo ori-entation therefore favours HON rebound, as is observed experimentally for the non-native substrate L-Nva17. We also note that the barrier for p-attack is somewhat higher than that fors-attack, which is consistent with the higher barrier observed experimentally for halogenation rela-tive to hydroxylation (by ,17 kJ mol\u20131)17, reflecting halogenation selectivity over efficiency. We have used NRVS to characterize the NHFe enzyme oxo inter-mediate in SyrB2 and found the Fe to be in a five-coordinate TBP configuration, with an axial Fe(IV)5O bond. The native-substrate-bound O2 reaction coordinate reproduces this structure and gives an intermediate with its Fe\u2013oxo vector perpendicular to the substrate C\u2013H bond; this Fe\u2013oxo orientation is active in hydrogen-atom abstrac-tion, via its p*-FMO. This positions the substrate radical favourably for ClN rebound, thus defining a selective mechanism in halogenases for chlorination of the native substrate. Alternatively, with a non-native substrate, variation in the O2 reaction coordinate can lead to an inter-mediate with its Fe\u2013oxo vector parallel to the substrate C\u2013H bond, leading to hydrogen-atom abstraction via a s-pathway and a substrate radical positioned for HON rebound and resultant hydroxylation.

All rights METHODS Sample preparation. Samples were prepared essentially as previously described7. Details of experimental conditions (such as concentrations) are provided in Supplementary Fig. 9. Spectroscopic methods. 57Fe NRVS spectra were recorded on multiple occasions at Beamline 3-ID at the Advanced Photon Source of the Argonne National Laboratory28, at temperatures between 10 K and 30 K, and once at BL09XU at SPring-8 in Japan29, at temperatures between 50 K and 80 K. NRVS data were collected only up to 600 cm\u20131 owing to relatively low sample concentrations (,1.8 mM); because NRVS signal intensity decreases exponentially with increas-ing energy, data collected above this region (given our allocated beamtime) would have had a low signal-to-noise ratio. Computational methods. DFT methods were used to simulate the NRVS spectra and Mo\u0308ssbauer parameters of all structural candidates, and to evaluate the hydro-gen-atom abstraction reaction coordinates. Spin-unrestricted DFT calculations were performed using the Turbomole 6.330 and Gaussian 0931 programs. Tur-bomole 6.3 was used to perform geometry optimizations and frequency calcula-tions of the structural candidates in Supplementary Fig. 6, with the BP8632\u201334 exchange-correlation functional and the double-f def2-SVP basis set35. Single-point energies were recomputed using the larger triple-f basis set def2-TZVP35. Turbomole calculations were expedited by expanding the Coulomb integrals in an auxiliary basis set, using the RI-J approximation36,37. Solvation effects were taken into account by using the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) method38,39 with a dielectric constant er 5 4 as is appropriate for the protein environment (the COSMO radii were set as follows: H, 1.30 A\u030a; C, 2.00 A\u030a; N, 1.83 A\u030a; O, 1.72 A\u030a; Cl, 2.05 A\u030a; Br, 2.16 A\u030a; S, 2.16 A\u030a; and Fe, 2.23 A\u030a). This is referred to as the RI-BP86/ def2-SVP (or def2-TZVP)/COSMO approach or level of theory. Gaussian 09 was used to perform geometry optimizations and frequency cal-culations of the structural candidates 1Cpg\u2013X in Fig. 3, with the functional/basis set combination BP86/6-311G*40\u201343. Solvation effects were taken into account with the polarized continuum model (PCM)44\u201347, using e 5 4.0. This is referred to as the BP86/6-311G*/PCM approach or level of theory. NRVS PVDOS spectra were simulated by fitting the DFT-calculated mode composition factor48 e2n,Fe~ mFer 2 n,Fe Patoms i mir2n,i (where m is the mass of atom i, and r is the displacement of atom i) for each normal mode n with individual Gaussians of FWHM 15 cm\u20131, using the gennrvs script49. Mo\u0308ssbauer isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings were calculated according to published methods50. The initial structure of the SyrB2 Fe(II) active site used for DFT calculations was taken from its crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. 1 and ref. 19). Inclusion of the substrate (L-Cpg-SH, where the terminal \u2013SH group represents truncation at the thioester linkage to the phosphopantetheine cofactor) was modelled according to ref. 12. Except where stated, the S atom of the substrate was frozen during geo-metry optimization. Note that the substrate does indeed fit well in the cavity of the active site (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The O2-reaction coordinate starting from the SyrB2\u2013Cl Fe(II) active site was pursued analogously to ref. 24, at the RI-BP86/def2-SVP(def2-TZVP)/COSMO level of theory. The complete O2-reaction coordinate for the L-Cpg-bound active site (with either Cl\u2013 or Br\u2013) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the final O\u2013O cleavage step, leading to the Fe(IV)5O intermediate, for three versions of the active site containing L-Cpg (inert substrate), L-Thr (native substrate) and L-Nva (non-native substrate). The hydrogen-atom abstraction reaction coordinates of the SyrB2\u2013Cl Fe(IV)5O intermediate were evaluated using the Turbomole 6.3 program30. 1Thr\u2013Cl was optimized at the B3LYP51\u2013531D2/def2-SVP level (where 1D2 stands for the second version of Grimme\u2019s empirical dispersion correction54,55). Ther-modynamic corrections to give enthalpic (DH) and Gibbs (DG) energies were calculated at T 5 278.15 K to reproduce experimental conditions7. Single-point energies were calculated at the B3LYP1D2/def2-TZVP/ COSMO(er 5 4.0) level. The calculated NRVS spectra of these Thr-bound species (Supplementary Fig. 10) are similar to those of their L-Cpg-bound counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 6), showing that the substrate does not affect the NRVS spectra because it is not directly coordinated to the Fe centre. Starting with 1Thr\u2013Cl and 2Thr\u2013Cl as the reactant complexes, each hydrogen-atom abstraction reaction was pursued along the oxo\u2013H(L-Thr) coordinate and each transition state was optimized from the highest-energy structure along the reaction coordinate. An internal reaction coordinate was calculated from each optimized transition state (forward) to obtain the product (Fe(III)\u2013OH 1 substrate radical) and (backward) to confirm the validity of the reactant complex structure. 30.

        "Mononuclear non-haem iron (NHFe) enzymes catalyse a broad range of oxidative reactions, including halogenation, hydroxyla-tion, ring closure, desaturation and aromatic ring cleavage reac-tions. They are involved in a number of biological processes, including phenylalanine metabolism, the production of neuro-transmitters, the hypoxic response and the biosynthesis of second-ary metabolites1\u20133. The reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycles of these enzymes is a high-spin S 5 2 Fe(IV)5O species, which has been trapped for a number of NHFe enzymes4\u20138, including the halogenase SyrB2 (syringomycin biosynthesis enzyme 2). Com-putational studies aimed at understanding the reactivity of this Fe(IV)5O intermediate9\u201313 are limited in applicability owing to the paucity of experimental knowledge about its geometric and electronic structure. Synchrotron-based nuclear resonance vibra-tional spectroscopy (NRVS) is a sensitive and effective method that defines the dependence of the vibrational modes involving Fe on the nature of the Fe(IV)5O active site14\u201316. Here we present NRVS structural characterization of the reactive Fe(IV)5O intermediate of a NHFe enzyme, namely the halogenase SyrB2 from the bac-terium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. This intermediate reacts via an initial hydrogen-atom abstraction step, performing subsequent halogenation of the native substrate or hydroxylation of non-native substrates17. A correlation of the experimental NRVS data to electronic structure calculations indicates that the substrate directs the orientation of the Fe(IV)5O intermediate, presenting specific frontier molecular orbitals that can activate either selective halogenation or hydroxylation.",
        "SyrB2, an a-ketoglutarate (aKG)-dependent NHFe enzyme found in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, halogenates the methyl group of L-threonine (L-Thr) using non-ribosomal peptide synthetase machinery18. The Fe(II) active site is ligated by two histidines and one halide (Cl\u2013 or Br\u2013) (see Supplementary Fig. 1)19, in contrast to the two-histidine/one-carboxylate \u2018facial triad\u2019 of other NHFe enzymes1,2,4,5,8. Although the mechanisms of O2 activation leading to the highly-reactive S 5 2 Fe(IV)5O intermediate are thought to be similar for allaKG-dependent NHFe enzymes, there is a notable divergence in their subsequent cata-lytic cycles (Fig. 1). The Fe(IV)5O species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to form an Fe(III)\u2013OH species and a substrate radical; in hydroxylases, the subsequent step is HON rebound to form a hydro-xylated product1,2, but in SyrB2 the native L-Thr substrate is chlorinated instead, and the 4-Cl-L-Thr product is used in the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin syringomycin E18. Owing to their reactivity, Fe(IV)5O intermediates in enzyme reactions are challenging to trap and char-acterize. For SyrB2, however, use of the non-native substrate L-cyclopropylglycine (L-Cpg) and the heterologous substrate carrier protein CytC2 has provided a long-lived species at the concentrations required for spectroscopic investigation17,20.",
        "Nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) utilizes third-generation synchrotron radiation to probe the vibrational sidebands of the 57Fe Mo\u0308ssbauer nuclear resonance peak at 14.4 keV (refs 21\u201323). NRVS is a site-selective technique allowing the observation of only normal modes involving Fe motion, which makes it ideal for studying iron-dependent enzymes without interference from protein backbone modes. (SyrB2)Fe(IV)5O can be generated in high purity with both Cl\u2013 and Br\u2013 ligation of the Fe(IV)5O unit, providing a mass perturba-tion that aids in the assignment of NRVS peaks and ultimately the structure of the intermediate. The NRVS methodology is coupled with spectroscopically calibrated density functional theory (DFT) calcula-tions to evaluate specific frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) responsible for hydrogen-atom abstraction that can selectively lead to halogenation or hydroxylation, depending on the substrate.",
        "In Fig. 2 we show the NRVS partial vibrational density-of-states (PVDOS) spectra of (SyrB2)Cl\u2013Fe(IV)5O with L-Cpg\u2013S\u2013CytC2 bound (referred to as SyrB2\u2013Cl) and the bromide analogue, (SyrB2)Br\u2013 Fe(IV)5O with L-Cpg\u2013S\u2013CytC2 bound (SyrB2\u2013Br). For practical rea-sons (see Methods), data collection was restricted to ,600 cm\u20131; modes in this region are affected by large (Cl versus Br; see below) but not small (16O versus 18O; see Supplementary Fig. 2) mass perturbations.

        "there are three distinct peaks falling within the energy regions of 200\u2013 285 cm\u20131, 285\u2013340 cm\u20131 and 340\u2013400 cm\u20131, matching regions 3, 2 and 1 in Fig. 2. Second, the intensities of the peaks in the two higher-energy regions are greater for 1Cpg\u2013Cl than for 1Cpg\u2013Br, and the intensity of the peak envelope in the lowest-energy region for 1Cpg\u2013Br is greater and shifted to lower energy with respect to that of 1Cpg\u2013Cl, repro-ducing the spectral intensity distributions of the experimental data (Fig. 2). Other five-and six-coordinate structures were generated as possible candidates for the Fe(IV)5O species, starting from 1Cpg\u2013X and shifting either the Fe-ligating atoms or the hydrogen-bonding network to the oxo group (Supplementary Fig. 6). From the predicted NRVS spectra of these structures and of the structures generated in previous (computational) studies (Supplementary Fig. 3), all structures except five-coordinate TBP can be eliminated owing to their poor agreement with the experimental NRVS data. Correlating the DFT-calculated spectra of five-coordinate TBP",
        "1Cpg\u2013X (Fig. 3) with the experimental spectra (Fig. 2), the NRVS peaks can be assigned to four normal modes (Fig. 4): the feature in region 1 (Fig. 2) originates from the Fe\u2013succinate stretch; the feature in region 2 is composed of a pair of trans-axial bending modes (these would be degenerate in strict TBP symmetry, but are calculated to split in energy because of the wider equatorial X\u2013Fe\u2013succinate angle of 143u)15; the",

        "lowest-energy region 3 has a peak envelope calculated to contain the trans-axial stretch and the Fe\u2013X stretch, with the Fe\u2013Br stretch being lower in energy by 30 cm\u20131 and more intense by 1.5 times. The redis-tribution in intensity is attributed to the mass perturbation of the Br, which has almost no motion in the Fe\u2013X stretching mode and conse-quently induces greater Fe motion in the mode. This Fe motion is borrowed from higher-energy modes, as analysed in Supplementary Fig. 7. The NRVS peak pattern of SyrB2\u2013X parallels that of a crystal-lographically characterized TBP S 5 2 Fe(IV)5O model complex (Supplementary Fig. 8)15, further demonstrating the sensitivity of NRVS to geometric structure.",
        "We note that two distinct Fe(IV) species are detected by Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy, differing in quadrupole splitting, DEQ (Supplementary Fig. 9), in each Fe(IV)5O intermediate generated7. A possible explana-tion for this speciation lies in the hydrogen-bonding interactions with the oxo group: 1Cpg\u2013Cl has two (with Arg 254 and H2O), whereas 1Thr\u2013Cl has one (with H2O). Their predicted NRVS spectra are similar (Supplementary Figs 6 and 10a), but their calculated values of DEQ are different, with that of 1Cpg\u2013Cl (\u20130.50 mm s \u20131) being smaller in mag-nitude than that of 1Thr\u2013Cl (\u20130.71 mm s \u20131). Decreasing the number of hydrogen bonds strengthens the Fe\u2013oxo bond, thus increasing the magnitude of (negative)DEQ (Supplementary Fig. 10a and Supplemen-tary Table 1). These calculations suggest that variability in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the oxo group results in Fe(IV) speciation, not some structural difference.",
        "For the native L-Thr substrate (starting from the O2-reaction-coordinate-derived Fe(IV)5O species 1Thr\u2013Cl, which has its Fe\u2013oxo vector perpen-dicular to C\u2013H (Supplementary Fig. 5b)) the hydrogen-atom abstraction reactivity was computationally evaluated (Fig. 5). The target C\u2013H approaches in a p-trajectory, transferring an a-electron into the oxo p-FMO, resulting in an Fe(III)\u2013OH first product (1Thr\u2013Fe(III)OH), in which the Fe(III) has spin S 5 5/2. The free-energy barrier DG{ for this p-pathway is 1100.4 kJ mol\u20131, in reasonable agreement with the experi-mental value of 179.4 kJ mol\u20131 (ref. 7). A number of possible explana-tions have been considered for the subsequent ClN rebound17,27; here we show that in this first product, the substrate radical is positioned closer to the Cl than to the OH ligand of Fe(III) (consideration of their ionic radii places Cl 0.5 A\u030a closer than OH), and OH is also stabilized by hydrogen-bonding to succinate (Fig. 5, right). This conformation dis-favours HON rebound but is well oriented for ClN rebound, as observed experimentally with the native substrate. This perpendicular Fe\u2013oxo ori-entation is, for the six-coordinate structures proposed in previous com-putational studies9\u201312, inaccessible via the O2-activation pathway because a bidentate succinate would block the oxo group from reorienting.",
        "Evaluation of the reaction coordinate for O\u2013O cleavage leading to the Fe(IV)5O species (Supplementary Fig. 5) revealed that the posi-tioning of L-Thr is fixed by two hydrogen-bonding interactions (\u2013OH and \u2013NH3 1) to Glu 102. This configuration results in the perpendic-ular orientation of the Fe(IV)\u2013oxo vector relative to the substrate C\u2013H bond. However, the alternative substrate L-norvaline (L-Nva) lacks the \u2013OH group, and thus its \u2013NH3 1 group can rotate to form a hydrogen bond with the O\u2013O (peroxy) bridge, leading to a structure with an Fe\u2013oxo vector oriented towards the substrate C\u2013H bond (Supplemen-tary Fig. 5c). An analogous L-Thr orientation was thus generated to evaluate its hydrogen-atom abstraction trajectory while maintaining the same C\u2013H bond (Fig. 5, left).",
        "For this orientation, the C\u2013H approaches the Fe\u2013oxo unit in a s-trajectory, transferring an a-electron into the oxo s-FMO to give an Fe(III)\u2013OH product in which the Fe(III) has spin S 5 5/2; this s-pathway has aDG{ of 170.2 kJ mol\u20131 (Fig. 5). Relative to thep-path-way Fe(III)\u2013OH product, this Fe(III)\u2013OH has the substrate radical closer to the OH ligand than the Cl (by 0.5 A\u030a, based on ionic radii), and OH has no hydrogen-bonding partner. The parallel Fe\u2013oxo ori-entation therefore favours HON rebound, as is observed experimentally for the non-native substrate L-Nva17. We also note that the barrier for p-attack is somewhat higher than that fors-attack, which is consistent with the higher barrier observed experimentally for halogenation rela-tive to hydroxylation (by ,17 kJ mol\u20131)17, reflecting halogenation selectivity over efficiency.",
        "We have used NRVS to characterize the NHFe enzyme oxo inter-mediate in SyrB2 and found the Fe to be in a five-coordinate TBP configuration, with an axial Fe(IV)5O bond. The native-substrate-bound O2 reaction coordinate reproduces this structure and gives an intermediate with its Fe\u2013oxo vector perpendicular to the substrate C\u2013H bond; this Fe\u2013oxo orientation is active in hydrogen-atom abstrac-tion, via its p*-FMO. This positions the substrate radical favourably for ClN rebound, thus defining a selective mechanism in halogenases for chlorination of the native substrate. Alternatively, with a non-native substrate, variation in the O2 reaction coordinate can lead to an inter-mediate with its Fe\u2013oxo vector parallel to the substrate C\u2013H bond, leading to hydrogen-atom abstraction via a s-pathway and a substrate radical positioned for HON rebound and resultant hydroxylation.",

Solvation effects were taken into account by using the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) method38,39 with a dielectric constant er 5 4 as is appropriate for the protein environment (the COSMO radii were set as follows: H, 1.30 A\u030a; C, 2.00 A\u030a; N, 1.83 A\u030a; O, 1.72 A\u030a; Cl, 2.05 A\u030a; Br, 2.16 A\u030a; S, 2.16 A\u030a; and Fe, 2.23 A\u030a). This is referred to as the RI-BP86/ def2-SVP (or def2-TZVP)/COSMO approach or level of theory.",
        "Gaussian 09 was used to perform geometry optimizations and frequency cal-culations of the structural candidates 1Cpg\u2013X in Fig. 3, with the functional/basis set combination BP86/6-311G*40\u201343. Solvation effects were taken into account with the polarized continuum model (PCM)44\u201347, using e 5 4.0. This is referred to as the BP86/6-311G*/PCM approach or level of theory.",

        "The initial structure of the SyrB2 Fe(II) active site used for DFT calculations was taken from its crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. 1 and ref. 19). Inclusion of the substrate (L-Cpg-SH, where the terminal \u2013SH group represents truncation at the thioester linkage to the phosphopantetheine cofactor) was modelled according to ref. 12. Except where stated, the S atom of the substrate was frozen during geo-metry optimization. Note that the substrate does indeed fit well in the cavity of the active site (Supplementary Fig. 1d).",
        "The O2-reaction coordinate starting from the SyrB2\u2013Cl Fe(II) active site was pursued analogously to ref. 24, at the RI-BP86/def2-SVP(def2-TZVP)/COSMO level of theory. The complete O2-reaction coordinate for the L-Cpg-bound active site (with either Cl\u2013 or Br\u2013) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the final O\u2013O cleavage step, leading to the Fe(IV)5O intermediate, for three versions of the active site containing L-Cpg (inert substrate), L-Thr (native substrate) and L-Nva (non-native substrate).",
        "The hydrogen-atom abstraction reaction coordinates of the SyrB2\u2013Cl Fe(IV)5O intermediate were evaluated using the Turbomole 6.3 program30. 1Thr\u2013Cl was optimized at the B3LYP51\u2013531D2/def2-SVP level (where 1D2 stands for the second version of Grimme\u2019s empirical dispersion correction54,55). Ther-modynamic corrections to give enthalpic (DH) and Gibbs (DG) energies were calculated at T 5 278.15 K to reproduce experimental conditions7. Single-point energies were calculated at the B3LYP1D2/def2-TZVP/ COSMO(er 5 4.0) level. The calculated NRVS spectra of these Thr-bound species (Supplementary Fig. 10) are similar to those of their L-Cpg-bound counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 6), showing that the substrate does not affect the NRVS spectra because it is not directly coordinated to the Fe centre. Starting with 1Thr\u2013Cl and 2Thr\u2013Cl as the reactant complexes, each hydrogen-atom abstraction reaction was pursued along the oxo\u2013H(L-Thr) coordinate and each transition state was optimized from the highest-energy structure along the reaction coordinate. An internal reaction coordinate was calculated from each optimized transition state (forward) to obtain the product (Fe(III)\u2013OH 1 substrate radical) and (backward) to confirm the validity of the reactant complex structure. 30.
