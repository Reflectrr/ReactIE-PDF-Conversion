However, the role of complex formation in enabling reactivity and guiding selectivity is poorly understood, owing to the challenges associated with obtaining detailed structural information on the dynamically associating protein complexes. Combining over 10 \u03bcs of classical molecular dynamics of SyrB2 and the acyl carrier protein SyrB1 with large-scale QM/MM simulation, we investigate the substrate-protein and protein-protein dynam-ics that give rise to experimentally observed substrate positioning and reactivity trends. We confirm the presence of a hypothesized substrate-delivery channel in SyrB2 through free energy simulations that show channel opening with a low free energy barrier. We identify stabilizing interactions at the SyrB2/SyrB1 interface that are compatible with phosphopantetheine (PPant) delivery of substrate to SyrB2. By sampling metal-substrate distances observed in experimental spectroscopy of native SyrB2/SyrB1-PPant-S-Thr and non-native substrates, we characterize essential protein-substrate interactions that are responsible for substrate positioning, and thus, reactivity. We observe the hydroxyl side chain and terminal amine of the native Thr substrate to form cooperative hydrogen bonds with a single N123 residue in SyrB2. In comparison, non-native substrates that lack the hydroxyl interact more flexibly with the protein and therefore can orient closer to the Fe center, explaining their preferential hydroxylation.

INTRODUCTION Mononuclear non-heme iron enzymes1-6 have attracted great interest for their ability to selectively functionalize otherwise unreactive C-H bonds, playing an essential role in biosyn-thesis pathways that produce clinically relevant natural products.7 As a result, the development of mimetic inorganic complexes of these enzymes has been an area of intense focus.8-12 Non-heme iron enzymes differ from their mimetics by operating under a distinct catalytic paradigm in which the enzyme environment protects a deeply buried but reactive metal center and controls specificity in part through substrate delivery.1-6 One such enzyme is SyrB2,13,14 an Fe/\u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG)-dependent halogenase13-20 from Pseudo-monas syringae in which the Fe(II) center is coordinated by two protein His, one Cl, and \u03b1KG. Once activated21 by substrate delivery via a prosthetic phosphopantetheine (PPant) arm attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) SyrB1,13 SyrB2 chlorinates the C4 position of a native L-Thr substrate. Halogenases like SyrB2 share structural and mechanistic commonalities with well-studied, non-heme iron hydroxy-lases.15,22 In both hydroxylases and halogenases, an Fe(IV)\ue0c8O intermediate forms, which carries out H atom abstraction followed by either hydroxylation or halogenation, respectively.1,13,14,21,23-28 For hydroxylases a 2His/1(Asp/ Glu) facial triad29,30 is essential for hydroxylation, whereas the Asp is replaced with Ala or Gly in halogenases to enable Cl binding to the metal center. Although Ala to Asp mutation in SyrB2 leads to some L-Thr hydroxylation,14 and replacement of Cl with N donors has catalyzed C-N bond formation,31 these substitutions alone do not confer native enzyme efficiency. Although substrate selectivity is governed in part by the ability of SyrB1 to link the amino acid residue substrate (Res) to PPant and form a PPant-S-Res moiety, non-native substrates that differ from Thr by lacking its hydroxyl side chain (i.e., aminobutyric acid or Aba) and/or containing a longer carbon chain (i.e., norvaline or Nva) have been successfully tethered to SyrB1/PPant.32 Reactivity studies32 on these substrates have revealed surprising reactivity patterns: H atom abstraction occurs up to 130\u00d7 faster for non-native substrates, concomitant with an increase in rebound hydroxylation Received: February 27, 2019 Revised: April 11, 2019 Published: April 18, 2019 Research Article pubs.acs.org/acscatalysisCite This: ACS Catal. 2019, 9, 4930-4943 \u00a9 2019 American Chemical Society 4930 DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.9b00865 ACS Catal. 2019, 9, 4930-4943 D ow nl oa de d vi a U N IV  IL L IN O IS  UR B A N A -C H A M PA IG N  on M ar ch  21,  202 3 at  20: 56 :4 9 (U T C ).

Thus, it appears that SyrB2 has a substrate-specific catalytic inefficiency for the native substrate that coincides with halogenation being favored over hydroxylation.32 This unexpected behavior has sparked vigorous computational33-38 and spectroscopic39,40 study of SyrB2 to better understand its unexpected reactivity. One suggestion18,37,40,41 has been that configurational isomerization of the active site, during18 or after formation of the oxo intermediate,38,41 reorients Cl to an axial position to make it more accessible for halogenation. However, this mechanism still requires some substrate-specific protein interaction and thus positioning that would enable isomerization for one substrate (e.g., Thr) while disfavoring it for others (e.g., Nva, Aba). Challenges remain in understanding the role that the greater protein and protein-protein complex must play in SyrB2/ SyrB1 reactivity. The crystal structure of SyrB214 was obtained with no obvious channel for substrate delivery, and SyrB1 has not been crystallographically characterized in isolation or in complex with SyrB2. Advances in structural characterization by cross-linking enzyme/ACP complexes42 and forming inter-mediate analogues,43 e.g., vanadyl44,45 intermediate mimics, have provided insight through static snapshots into protein-protein interactions or active site rearrangements during the catalytic cycle of related enzymes. Computational modeling can provide complementary insight into transient interactions and in cases where structural characterization is incomplete. However, most modeling has been carried out on cluster models of SyrB2 with few exceptions,36,38 despite the wider use of whole-protein multiscale modeling for other non-heme iron enzymes.46-51 To date, no SyrB2/SyrB1 complexes have been simulated, with the largest models using truncated34,36-38 PPant-S-Thr models placed in SyrB2 by rotating or mutating F196. Shedding insight into structural features of the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex, Silakov and co-workers52 recently employed hyper-fine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE)53 spectroscopy to estimate average positions and angles of PPant-loaded substrate methyl and methylene/hydroxymethylene carbons with respect to the iron center in the active site of the SyrB2/ SyrB1 complex, similar to previous efforts that had provided insight into non-heme iron hydroxylases.54,55 This analysis provided a basis for observed reactivity patterns,32 previously only inferred32 or suggested from simulation34 to be a consequence of positioning, by identifying a greater distance between Fe and the native Thr substrate than non-native Nva or Aba. Although providing essential quantitative insight into substrate/active-site positioning, the HYSCORE models cannot be used to determine which protein-substrate interactions give rise to these observed positions or which configurational isomer the active site samples when the distances are measured. The role of the greater protein environment in conferring differences in substrate-specific reactivity thus remains unknown in SyrB2. In this work, we employ long-time classical molecular dynamics (MD) and large-scale quantum mechan-ics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulation to reveal the nature of the protein-protein and protein-substrate inter-actions that confer reactivity and selectivity in the SyrB2/ SyrB1 complex. These simulations provide detailed informa-tion about how differences between the orientation of the native Thr substrate and those of non-native Nva or Aba result from distinct interactions between Thr and active-site residues. These data represent the first guidance on protein-substrate interactions that govern positioning and reactivity in SyrB2 and reveal the enzyme-specific origins of divergent reactivity. Beyond SyrB2/SyrB1, the protocol described here to use experimental guidance of local active site interactions in dynamics simulations is anticipated to be broadly useful for other multiprotein complexes, e.g., the PPant-dependent halogenase CytC315,16,56 that has only been crystallized in an inactive form, as well as in carrier-protein-free enzymes (e.g., WelO5).18 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.a. Dynamics of Isolated SyrB2 and SyrB1 Proteins. SyrB1, a member of the ACP family, contains two domains,13,57 the adenylation, or A, domain and a thiolation, or T, domain. The T domain is responsible for delivering substrate to SyrB2 via a PPant arm that is connected by a phosphate group to a Ser residue in SyrB1 (Figure 1). Although SyrB1 has not been crystallographically character-ized, ACP T domains are highly conserved, and homology modeling of the SyrB1 T domain based on a related ACP58 afforded a stable structure as evaluated over 500 ns of dynamics (see Computational Details). In solution, the PPant-S-Thr arm on SyrB1 samples a very broad conformational ensemble, characterized by the radius of gyration, Rg, defined from the phosphate group to the terminal carbon of the Thr substrate, having a peak below 4 \u00c5 but a broad overall distribution from 3.5 to more than 7.0 \u00c5 (Figure 1 and Supporting Information Figure S1). In the smallest Rg configurations, the substrate curls on itself, minimizing solvent exposure, whereas the largest Rg values correspond to an extended, nearly linear configuration of PPant (Figure 1 and Supporting Information Figure S2 and Table S1). The observations on the MD ensemble suggest that PPant frequently samples bent, compact configurations but will extend with a small barrier (\u223c1.5 kcal/mol) to form a configuration slightly higher in free energy (\u223c0.5 kcal/mol) that is compatible with docking to SyrB2. This analysis is consistent with the modest fraction (\u223c20%) of the NMR ensemble58 of the ACP on which SyrB1 was homology modeled in which the PPant structure is extended (Supporting Information Table S2 and Figure S3). In comparison to free SyrB1 PPant, PPant dynamics in a docked SyrB2/SyrB1 complex show a considerably narrower Rg distribution centered around 6.7 \u00c5 (Figure 1). The Figure 1. (a) Normalized histograms of Rg (in \u00c5) for PPant evaluated configurations sampled in the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex are consistent with the elongated local minimum observed in free SyrB1 dynamics, and overall geometries are comparable (Supporting Information Figure S2 and Table S1). Thus, at room temperature, SyrB1 likely samples geometries that enable SyrB2/SyrB1 docking through PPant/substrate chain elonga-tion, although this configuration is not the global minimum for isolated SyrB1 PPant in solution. This computational characterization of ACP dynamics in a SyrB1 model provides important insight into SyrB2/SyrB1 complexation in the absence of prior crystallographic characterization. The SyrB2 holoenzyme\u2019s crystal structure has been obtained14 with no apparent opening for SyrB1 to deliver substrate to the SyrB2 active site. It has been proposed14 that rotation of a phenylalanine residue (F196) could allow PPant and substrate to access the non-heme Fe(II) active site, but it is unknown if the free energy landscape and dynamics of residues surrounding F196 would then allow substrate delivery by PPant. Here, we employ long-time MD and umbrella sampling to quantify structural properties and free energies of SyrB2 protein configurations that enable substrate delivery to the active site. In the crystal structure, F196 in SyrB2 closes the channel entry to the active site with a \u03c71, \u03c72 dihedral pair of (-42\u00b0, 98\u00b0), where \u03c71 represents the rotation of F196 about the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 axis, and \u03c72 represents the tilt of F196 with respect to the backbone with 180\u00b0 periodicity due to symmetry in the phenyl ring (Figure 2 inset and Supporting Information Figure S4). We first carried out over 1.6 \u03bcs of aggregate MD simulations of SyrB2 starting from the experimental structure and nine other rotameric states of F196 (Supporting Information Table S3 and Figure S5). Six of the simulations exclusively sampled in the vicinity of the crystal structure F196 configuration, albeit with broad distributions having widths of 60\u00b0 in \u03c71 and 90\u00b0 in \u03c72 (Supporting Information Figure S6). Without apparent dependence on starting rotamer, four other simulations sampled a number of distinct rotameric states, with multiple nanosecond time scale transitions observed during each 250 ns simulation (Supporting Information Figure S7). To identify the relative free energy of metastable F196 rotameric states, we then computed the two-dimensional free energy surface (FES) defined by \u03c71 and \u03c72 of F196 (see Computational Details). Consistent with the equilibrium MD simulations, the crystal structure minimum is observed to be the FES global minimum, but other local minima are evident (Figure 2). Namely, a second minimum near (-165\u00b0, 95\u00b0) is about 1 kcal/mol above the global minimum. The path connecting the two minima corresponds to rotation of the F196 phenyl ring around the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 axis without significant change in the tilt of the ring and is characterized by a 2.5 kcal/ mol free energy barrier (i.e., \u03c71 variation with fixed \u03c72, Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure S8). To confirm that this second minimum corresponds to an open, active-site-accessible configuration of SyrB2 in compar-ison to the closed crystal structure configuration, we carried out cavity analysis59 that has previously been fruitfully applied to related non-heme iron dioxygenases60 (see Computational Details). In the crystal configuration, the cavity connecting the solvated exterior of SyrB2 and the Fe(II)-centered active site appears pinched at F196, with a large number of MD snapshots having a cavity radius at the C\u03b2 of F196 of only approximately 1.2 \u00c5 (Figure 2). Repeating this analysis on the (-165\u00b0, 95\u00b0) local minimum reveals a uniformly wider cavity with a radius of approximately 2.5 \u00c5 at the C\u03b2 of F196 (Figure 2). Analysis on the overall bottleneck of the channel, rather than just the width at the F196 C\u03b2, shows consistent results (Supporting Information Figure S9). Thus, rotation of F196 about the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 axis, which likely occurs on nanosecond time scales, will make substrate delivery to the active site possible. We also evaluated the F196 dihedral in a SyrB2/SyrB1 complex to identify how F196 orientations and the channel might change in the presence of PPant and the SyrB2/SyrB1 interface. Overall, the \u03c71 distribution is unchanged, but the average value of \u03c72 decreases slightly, indicative of a tilting of the phenyl ring that would have a small free-energy cost in isolated SyrB2 (Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure S10). Cavity analysis on the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex with SyrB1 removed reveals an enlarged cavity in the complex with a radius of approximately 3.4 \u00c5 to accommodate PPant and substrate (Figure 2). The slight change in F196 tilt can only partly explain the enlargement, as cavity analysis of SyrB2-only configurations with the shifted dihedral of the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex only increases the peak of the radius distribution at Figure 2. (Top) Visualization of median cavities connecting SyrB2 the C\u03b2 of F196 by approximately 0.4 \u00c5 (Supporting Information Figure S11). Comparing SyrB2 in the SyrB2/ SyrB1 complex with isolated SyrB2 in the open or closed configuration indeed reveals additional differences beyond just F196 rotation. Namely, the F196-containing loop moves to open the cavity, a short N62-N65 \u03b1-helix is displaced, and an adjacent I57-G59 loop reorients (Supporting Information Figure S12). These motions all contribute to enlarging the cavity for PPant/substrate delivery upon complexation. 2.b. SyrB2/SyrB1 Interface Interactions and Dynam-ics. After docking SyrB1-PPant-S-Thr to an open configuration of SyrB2, the overall complex is stable, without significant increases in center-of-mass distances between the two proteins over long-time dynamics (Supporting Information Figure S13). Classical energy decomposition analysis (i.e., generalized Born or GBSA; see Computational Details) reveals that several protein-protein interface interactions stabilize the complex. Favorable interactions are predominantly electrostatic in nature and occur at the interface of flexible loops and small helices on SyrB2 with adjacent residues on SyrB1 that were shown to shift upon complexation (Supporting Information Figure S12 and Table S4). The strongest such interactions occur between SyrB1 D589 and SyrB2 S58 and in the form of a salt bridge between SyrB1 R575 and SyrB2 D181 (Supporting Information Tables S4 and S5). This model of the SyrB2/ SyrB1 interface provides targets for experimental mutagenesis to stabilize a long-lived SyrB2/SyrB1 complex (Supporting Information Figure S14). Within the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex, the PPant arm forms a number of favorable stabilizing interactions with the SyrB2 cavity, as judged through geometric hydrogen bonding (HB) and GBSA analysis. These interactions are distributed along the 14 \u00c5 length of the PPant. The PPant phosphate group hydrogen bonds at the SyrB2 surface with N184, which also participates in SyrB2/SyrB1 interface interactions (Figure 3). Favorable van der Waals interactions are observed between the gating F196 and PPant as well as the adjacent F195 (Figure 3 and Supporting Information Table S5). HB analysis reveals a strong interaction between an E111 HB acceptor and a PPant hydroxyl (\u223c2.6-2.7 \u00c5) with high frequency (>70% of all MD snapshots, Supporting Information Table S6). The SyrB2 S185 is a HB donor (40%) to the PPant phosphate, and N62 is a HB donor to a carbonyl in a PPant amide bond with a longer bond length (2.8-2.9 \u00c5) that means it is detected less frequently (6%, Supporting Information Table S7). In recent HYSCORE experiments by Silakov and co-workers,52 an Fe-bound NO molecule provided an EPR-active probe, revealing that native Thr substrates are positioned further from the metal center than non-native substrates as judged by the distance of iron to the closest terminal hydrogen atoms (Thr, 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5; Nva, 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5; Aba, 3.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5).52 Overall, the substrates were observed to be at an acute angle to the Fe-N bond (85 \u00b1 10\u00b0 for Thr/Aba and 64 \u00b1 7\u00b0 for Nva52), but these distances and angles leave open several possibilities for how the substrate could be oriented in the active site given ongoing uncertainty over the configurational isomer of the active site37,38,41,52 (Supporting Information Figure S15). In the absence of available high-resolution crystal structures, MD simulation of the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex is expected to provide valuable insight into substrate delivery, substrate-protein interactions that drive substrate specificity, and dynamics at the SyrB2 active site. However, the noncovalent interactions that govern the substrate-protein positioning in the active site are notoriously difficult to describe correctly with standard, point-charge force fields.61-67 Indeed, micro-second-length MD of SyrB1-PPant loaded with each of the three substrates in combination with the three most probable active-site configurational isomers seldom samples the HYSCORE distances or angles, instead favoring a broad distribution (approximately 4-11 \u00c5 and up to 15 \u00c5 for Aba substrates) of terminal methyl H atom (Me) to Fe distances (Fe-Me, Supporting Information Table S8). The experimen-tally observed, substrate specific Fe-Me distance trend (i.e., Thr > Aba > Nva) can be discerned from the minimum sampled distances in any of the configurational isomers but is not preserved for the average sampled distances (Supporting Information Table S8). Unlike experiments52 that show longer methylene hydrogen (Mt) atom distances to Fe (i.e., Fe-Mt) in comparison to Fe-Me (\u223c1.0 \u00c5 for Aba and substantial for Nva), MD-sampled distances are instead comparable (Supporting Information Table S8). Longer Fe-Me and Fe-Mt distances lead to sampling of a wide range of Fe-N-Me and Fe-N-Mt angles (0-125\u00b0) in all configurational isomers. At these longer distances, equatorial (eq)-NO configurations are more likely than axial (ax)-NO to sample the experimental Fe-N-Me and Fe-N-Mt angles regardless of substrate (Supporting Information Figures S16-S22 and Table S8). In cases where free dynamics of ax-\u03b1KG samples better distances, such as for Nva and Aba substrates, agreement with experimental angles worsens (Supporting Information Figures S23 and S24). Over all sampled configurations, no substrate/configura-tional isomer combination yields a structure with all four distances and angles within the experimental measurement uncertainty. However, configurations close to the experimental values are infrequently observed, especially for Thr, which had the longest experimental target distances (Figure 4 and Supporting Information Figure S15 and Tables S9-S17). To overcome limitations of classical MD that often prevent the sampling of short noncovalent interactions,66-68 we therefore turn to enforcing the HYSCORE distances and identifying the protein-substrate interactions favored in configurations that satisfy experimental restraints. 2.c. Restrained MD Identifies Protein-Substrate Interactions. Adjusted restraints (see Computational Details) were used to enforce experimentally observed52 distances and angles. In all cases, reasonable structures were achieved Figure 3. Schematic of key hydrogen bonding interactions (blue without any apparent distortion of the bond lengths and angles of the substrate or the active site, supporting the reported experimental values as feasible in the active SyrB2/SyrB1 complex for any of the configurational isomers. In all cases, the Fe-Me distances are sampled more readily, and all target distances are most easily satisfied in the crystal-structure-like ax-NO isomers (Figure 5 and Supporting Information Figures S25-S33). Our observation is in contrast to earlier motivations52 for alternative configurational isomers to the ax-NO crystal structure analogue based on the expectation that acute Fe-N-Me/Mt angles would be hard to satisfy at such short distances in the ax-NO isomer. Average distances and angles preserve observed HYSCORE trends52 in all isomers, suggesting we cannot immediately rule out any of the configurational isomers as incompatible with the spectroscopi-cally inferred distances and angles52 (Figure 5 and Supporting Information Table S18). An open question is whether target distances may be satisfied in only one substrate orientation. Most distance and angle distributions are approximately normal with a single distinct pose (e.g., for Nva or Thr in ax/eq-NO isomers) except for Aba that samples multiple configurations as indicated by analysis of representative poses (Figure 5 and Supporting Information Figures S27, S30, and S33 and Table S19). This difference in Aba corresponds to its ability to satisfy Fe-Me target distances with both gauche and trans dihedral (i.e., N(H3 +)-C-C(Mt)-C(Me)) angles (Supporting Information Table S19 and structures provided in the Supporting Information). To determine which favorable protein-substrate interac-tions underlie the experimentally observed substrate position-ing and, secondarily, to rationalize why these distances were not predominantly sampled in free MD, we analyze and compare interaction energies (i.e., GBSA) and hydrogen bonding strengths of the trajectories (see Computational Details). In the ax/eq-NO isomers, strong interactions (i.e., from GBSA or HB analysis) are observed between all substrates and polar, neutral residues (i.e., N62, Y66, N123, and Y272). This is in contrast to unrestrained MD, in which interactions with charged residues (i.e., E102, E271) dominate, as well as to prior computational modeling37,38,40 that had sampled substrate positioning in the active site without enforcing HYSCORE distances and angles52 (Supporting Information Figure S34). These interactions are reduced in strength in the restrained MD of Thr/Nva and absent in the case of Aba (Supporting Information Tables S12-S17 and S20-S25). For Thr, HYSCORE-restrained MD shifts -OH HBs to N123 instead of E102, which instead interacts with the NH3 + group (Supporting Information Tables S15 and S22). Poor sampling of experimentally observed52 distances in free MD can be attributed to limitations of point charge force fields.61-67 The critical role of N123 in substrate positioning will be revisited in the following section. Although all three configurational isomers can support the experimentally observed distances, observations thus far Figure 4. Representative frames from classical MD that correspond most closely to experimentally observed distances for Thr in three suggest eliminating ax-\u03b1KG as a probable isomer. With respect to other configurational isomers, fewer protein-substrate interactions are observed in ax-\u03b1KG: the NH3 + groups of Nva and Aba form no substantial HBs and, when present, the Thr -OH/E102 HB prevents E102 from cooperatively interacting with NH3 +, which occurs readily in other isomers (Supporting Information Tables S14-S17 and S22-S25). Additionally, the larger \u03b1KG (vs NO or Cl) in the axial position orients the substrate, and the NH3 + group in particular, away from enzyme active-site residues (Supporting Information Figure S35). These structural differences also explain the difficulty with which Fe-Mt distances and angles were satisfied in this isomer (Figure 5). Although ax-\u03b1KG has been observed in clavaminate synthase,69 this alternative active-site configuration for SyrB2 was proposed in the context of the expected difficulty of satisfying the restraint distances with crystal structure analogue ax-NO. Given the lack of disproportionate support for eq-NO or ax-\u03b1KG in our work, we focus on the crystal-structure analogue ax-NO isomer for further consideration of substrate-specific differences, with alternative isomer data provided in the Supporting Informa-tion. In experimentally guided simulations, Fe-Me and Fe-Mt distances appear to be related to the depth at which substrates sit in the active-site cavity. We now define a quantitative measure of the depth of the PPant-substrate delivery to SyrB2 to provide more insight into substrate-active-site interactions. After identifying immobile regions of the protein, we selected two subsets of \u03b2-sheet residues, over which we track the center of mass of all C\u03b1 atoms to serve as reference points: B11, M249-V256; B12, Y255-V256 (Supporting Information Figure S36). In addition to following the same \u03b2-sheet strand, these two points run adjacent to the vector along which PPant enters SyrB2, with B12 corresponding to greater active-site depth than B11. Thus, substrate delivery depth can be judged by relative distance to B11 and B12, dB12-dB11, where smaller values correspond to deeper substrate delivery. As expected, smaller dB12-dB11 values for the Me carbon of Thr (i.e., 2.7 \u00c5 average in ax-NO) than for Nva or Aba (i.e., around 3.5-3.6 \u00c5) indicate deeper substrate delivery for Thr (Figure 6 and Supporting Information Table S26). The dB12-dB11 values for the N in NH3 + rank the substrates as Thr < Aba < Nva (i.e., 2.6 \u00c5 Thr average in ax-NO vs 3.2 and 4.5 \u00c5 for Aba and Nva), indicating the native substrate is distinguished by positioning away from the axial NO species and deeper into the active site (Figure 6 and Supporting Information Table S26). In comparison to these observations on ax-NO, eq-NO and ax-\u03b1KG isomers do not preserve these trends, positioning Thr equivalently to either Nva or Aba Me C, respectively, due to shallower and broader overall positioning of substrates in the active sites, especially for ax-\u03b1KG (Supporting Information Table S26 and Figure S36). It has been argued32,34,52 that substrate-and atom-specific hydroxylation/halogenation branching ratios result from substrate positioning: suboptimal proximity to the Fe(IV)\ue0c8O intermediate should lead to chlorination rather than rebound hydroxylation. The C-to-N distance clearly distinguishes substrates with Nva \u226a Aba < Thr for both ax-NO and eq-NO (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Table S27). At the same time, for both ax-NO and eq-NO configurations, distances of the methyl C to Cl span a narrow 3-4 \u00c5 range, with all substrates having average distances of around 3.3-3.5 \u00c5 (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Table S27 and Figures S38 and S39). The enforcement of experimentally observed Fe-Me/Mt distances and Fe-N-Me/Mt angles provides an indirect enforcement of this order, but C-N or C-Cl distances have not been constrained in any way. According to previous experimental studies, the methylene carbon (C4) of Nva reacts similarly to the methylene carbon of Aba in terms of both rates and branching ratios with both carbon atoms undergoing a mixture of hydroxylation and chlorination.32 Similar orientations with respect to the Fe center have also been indicated,52 and thus in our experimentally restrained simulations the Nva C4 has similar Figure 6. (Left) Substrate depth delivery metric (dB12-dB11, in \u00c5) for C-Cl and C-N distance distributions to Aba (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Figure S40). This correspondence is clearest in the ax-NO isomer (Supporting Information Figure S40). In comparison, the methylene and hydroxymethylene carbons of Aba and Thr, respectively, sample much longer C-N distances in both isomers (Supporting Information Figure S41). Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that increased halogenation of Thr with lower turnover rates32,52 is governed by longer Thr (vs Nva or Aba) distances to the oxo species rather than reduced distances to Cl (Figure 7). Both ax-NO and eq-NO isomers obey this trend, indicating that the active-site configuration does not control relative C-Cl vs C-N distance (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Figure S40). 2.d. Analysis of Substrate-Dependent Hydrogen Bonding. Although we have shown that experimentally observed distances could be enforced in dynamics, longer distances were preferred in free dynamics. Owing to the limitations of point charge force fields, we therefore turn to QM/MM geometry optimizations to further characterize active site interactions and to determine if the experimentally observed substrate/active-site positions are favorable at the QM/MM level of theory. Over nearly 50 QM/MM geometry optimizations, the distances and angles remained close to the experimental distances, with up to 0.15 \u00c5 elongation in the Fe-Me distance, especially for Nva or Aba in the ax-NO and eq-NO isomers (Supporting Information Table S28). This elongation corresponds to a small change (typically, a decrease) in the Fe-N-Me angle (approximately 5-10\u00b0) with similar or smaller changes to the Mt distances and angles (Supporting Information Table S28). In comparison, Thr Fe-Me/Mt distances elongate only slightly (\u223c0.01 \u00c5 on average), and angle changes are also smaller (Supporting Information Table S28). Having confirmed that we are able to sample experimentally observed distances, we now turn to analyzing substrate/active-site interactions through QM/MM simulation. We particularly focus on electronic structure properties by using bond critical points (BCPs70) from quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM, see Computational Details) to identify and quantify the strength of HB interactions. QM analysis of HBs between the substrates and the greater protein active site largely confirms observations based on classical geometric HB analysis but provides additional insight (Supporting Information Tables S15-S17 and S22-S24). Notably, Thr forms addi-tional HBs in the ax-NO configuration, as judged by QM analysis after QM/MM optimization, that were not observed in geometric analysis alone (Supporting Information Figure S42 and Table S29). The HB between the side chain amide H of N123 and Thr -OH that was observed in geometric analysis is confirmed here with an estimated -7.2 kcal/mol stabilizing interaction with an O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H distance of 1.9 \u00c5 (Supporting Information Table S29). In addition, a second strong interaction of -5.2 kcal/mol is simultaneously observed between the carbonyl O of the N123 side chain and the NH3 + of the Thr substrate with approximately 2.2 \u00c5 O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H separation (Figure 8 and Supporting Information Table S29). Aba also interacts with N123 in the ax-NO configurational isomer, but the single HB (d = 1.9 \u00c5) between the carbonyl O of N123 and Aba\u2019s NH3 + of -6.9 kcal/mol is much weaker than the sum of the two cooperative interactions for Thr (Supporting Information Table S29). The single interaction with the NH3 + functional group also allows Aba to position closer to the Fe center than the simultaneous interactions do in the case of Thr, as we will discuss next (Figure 8 and Supporting Information Table S29). The same closer position-ing of Nva due to a single interaction with NH3 + is also observed, but the HB interactions are formed instead with Y66, E102, and E271 (Supporting Information Table S29). No HBs are detected for the Nva substrate in the ax-\u03b1KG isomer, and no OH-specific HBs are detected for Thr, in comparison to those present in the other two isomers, meaning that an alternative explanation would be required to explain the experimentally observed distances (see Supporting Information Table S29). To further quantify the unique HB configuration observed in Thr, we extracted for QM/MM optimization MD snapshots at varying Thr NH3 +/N123 carbonyl distances that were identified less frequently as HBs by classical analysis (Supporting Information Table S30). For MD snapshots with two initially short HBs, QM/MM optimization preserves the double HB configuration and exhibits total HB energies as large as -21 kcal/mol for the shortest QM/MM-stabilized 1.7-1.9 \u00c5 HBs (Supporting Information Table S30). These bond lengths are similar to those in a spectroscopically characterized cooperative hydrogen bonding interaction between formamide and a water chain.71 Optimization of structures with a single HB to the Thr -OH does not result in reorientation to recapture the second HB, as expected from a double well potential (Supporting Information Table S30). In fact, in intermediate orientations, the single HB (d = 1.8 \u00c5) that remains between Thr -OH and N123 amide H (where d = 4.0 \u00c5 for the other HB) can be as strong as -10 kcal/mol, which is stronger than the same interaction in double HB configurations (Supporting Information Table S30). Although the double HB configuration was not frequently observed in classical geometric HB analysis, such analysis employs a tight heavy atom cutoff (d(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X) = 3.0 \u00c5), and short noncovalent interactions are disfavored by standard force field parameters. Thus, we directly computed the distances of the Thr -OH and -NH3+ to the N123 amide H and carbonyl O throughout MD (Supporting Information Figures S43 and S44). With extensive sampling, we indeed observed distances Figure 8. Comparison of quantum mechanical properties of hydrogen consistent with a double HB configuration, although it occurred less frequently than a single HB (Supporting Information Figure S43). Over 1 \u03bcs of dynamics, we estimate the relative free energy of the configurations from their probabilities and find the double HB to be within 1 kcal/mol of the single HB global minimum and separated by a small free energy barrier (Figure 9). Single HB configurations are strongly preferred in the eq-NO configuration over comparable sampling times (Supporting Information Figure S44). Neither HB to N123 is observed over 500 ns of MD for the ax-\u03b1KG case, with the non-Thr-specific NH3 + HB being the only one that forms appreciably (Supporting Information Figure S44). Analyzing the ax-NO double HB approximate free energies, we conclude that the relative stability of the two configurations is likely sensitive to the force field parameters, and both ax-NO and eq-NO isomers have the potential to favor a double HB configuration with N123 (Figure 9). Although the double HB configuration from classical MD is destabilized by 0.5 kcal/mol with respect to the single HB configuration, MD bias against short noncovalent distances in comparison to computationally expensive QM methods is known to be on the order of several kcal/mol.72 Thus, we shift our focus to the relative QM favorability of the two configurations. Given that QM HB analysis revealed interactions and distances shorter than had been observed in MD, we investigated the interaction of minimal QM-only models of not just N123 but also the active-site N62, Y66, E102, and E271 residues with truncated PPant-S-Res (Res = Thr, Nva, or Aba) models (Supporting Information Table S31). When the substrates and protein residues are no longer restrained in any way by the protein, Nva and Aba form multiple, strong HBs (d = 1.7-2.0 \u00c5) with N123, including to the backbone carbonyl O (Supporting Information Table S31 and Figure S45). When we freeze backbone atoms of the PPant-S-Res fragment and the protein residues, interactions comparable to the QM/MM model are instead recovered: Nva forms no HBs with N123, instead forming HBs with E271, and Aba forms one only to the side chain carbonyl O atom (Supporting Information Table S32 and Figure S45). Throughout MD, the distance of the amine N of any substrate to the backbone carbonyl O atom is never less than 4.5 \u00c5 (this shortest value is observed only for Aba) for any of the configurational isomers (Supporting Information Figure S46). Thus, it appears that the greater protein environment is essential in positioning N123 to form a double HB with the Thr amine and -OH side chain that is not observed for the non-native substrates (Thr and Aba are compared in Figure 10; Nva is also shown in Supporting Information Figure S45). On the basis of the distinct HB interactions observed in the native and non-native substrates, it is now possible to rationalize the difference in reactivity based on different substrate positions. Previous experimental and theoretical studies32,34 have emphasized the importance of substrate positioning in the diverging reactivity of SyrB2 for native and non-native substrates and suggested that residues (e.g., R254) could interact with the Fe-OH moiety to prevent rebound hydroxylation for Thr.38 However, substrate-specific hydrogen bonding to the protein that is compatible with HYSCORE-determined52 substrate positioning has not yet been identified (Supporting Information Figure S34). The protein environ-ment provides two strong HBs between the Thr and N123 that are stabilizing by up to 21 kcal/mol (Figure 10). Alternative interactions observed in non-native substrates through only the NH3 + group are smaller (around 15 kcal/mol) and less directional for Aba or involve interacting with multiple residues, e.g., as in Nva with Y66, E102, and E271 (Figure 8). These more flexible interactions with only one functional group on the substrate (i.e., for Nva or Aba) allow the substrate to remain near Fe (Figure 10). The double HB configuration, on the other hand, pulls Thr further away from the Fe in the active site, and consequently from the reactive Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate in the catalytic cycle, but at an optimum distance from Cl thus allowing SyrB2 to favor chlorination for Thr instead of hydroxylation as in Nva (Figure 10). Prior computational studies had instead identified interactions of Thr with E102, an interaction observed in our unrestrained MD but one that produces substrate orientations inconsistent with HYSCORE angles (Supporting Information Figure S34). Replacing the spectroscopically relevant active site model (i.e., \u03b1KG and bound NO) with the reactive Fe(IV)\ue0c8O/succinate intermediate and carrying out QM/MM geometry optimizations preserves placement of the substrate and hydrogen bonding with N123 suggesting the catalytic Figure 9. Approximate free energy (in kcal/mol) from -kT ln \u27e8P\u27e9 of relevance of this interaction (Supporting Information Figure S34). On the basis of these observations, we would expect mutation of N123 to significantly affect the chlorination of native substrate Thr by the multiprotein assembly SyrB2-SyrB1. Review of the literature allowed us to identify a prior experimental study that showed that the mutation of N123 causes a decrease in production of syringomycin E by SyrB2 as shown by a decrease in antifungal activity. The residual activity after mutation was shown to be 26-30% for N123A in SyrB2,27 potentially due to loss of the critical substrate positioning interaction. This relationship could be explored further through HYSCORE of N123A or N123Q mutants that should influence substrate-active-site distances. The protocol we have described here could likely be even more robustly applied to the halogenase WelO5,18 where an available crystal structure could be readily compared to observed protein-substrate interactions during MD or QM/MM simulation (Supporting Information Figure S47). 3. CONCLUSIONS From well over 10 \u03bcs of MD of both free and complexed SyrB2 and SyrB1 along with large-scale QM/MM simulation, we have investigated the substrate-protein and protein-protein dynamics that give rise to experimentally observed substrate positioning and reactivity trends. First, we confirmed low 2-3 kcal/mol free energy barriers for F196 rotation in SyrB2 to open a channel for substrate delivery. We identified concomitant rearrangement of surface residues on SyrB1 (i.e., N62-N65 and I57-G59) that further widened the substrate delivery cavity when a SyrB1 model was docked to SyrB2, indicating concerted motions that enable substrate delivery. Although in solution the SyrB1 PPant-S-Res arm prefers a closed conformation, the elongated orientation compatible with substrate delivery is also transiently observed in solution. In the context of the SyrB2 channel, PPant is restricted in its motion both due to the shape of the cavity and the formation of interactions with essential residues that stabilize PPant (e.g., N184, F195, F196) and the SyrB2/SyrB1 (e.g., D181/R575 and S58/D589) interface. Although free dynamics of the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex did not sample experimentally observed substrate-Fe active site distances, HYSCORE-derived52 restraints easily satisfied target distances and angles to enable investigation of protein-substrate interactions. We observed a unique, cooperative pattern of hydrogen bonding that occurred only for the native Thr substrate: both hydroxyl and amine functional groups formed hydrogen bonds with N123. As judged through QM/ MM analysis, this interaction was stronger than any alternative amine-only hydrogen bonding configurations and favored in both spectroscopic Fe-NO/\u03b1KG and catalytic Fe(IV)\ue0c8O/ succinate active site configurations. Conversely, Nva and Aba are only able to form hydrogen bonds to the protein with their amine functional groups, enabling them the flexibility to position closer to the Fe center. This analysis could explain the experimental observations given either an ax-NO or eq-NO active site configuration but not ax-\u03b1KG. Overall, the unique orientation of native Thr corresponded to quantitatively deeper substrate delivery than non-native substrates. All substrates had similar proximity to Cl, but Thr was most distant from the anticipated location of the oxo species. Although SyrB2/SyrB1 was the focus of the present work, we expect the protocol of using experimental active site interactions to guide dynamics simulations to be broadly useful in natural product biosynthesis pathways. In many such enzymes, either prosthetic-arm-guided substrate positioning is essential or protein-substrate dynamics are anticipated to play a key role. However, capturing these key interactions is often challenging without molecular simulation. This work thus demonstrates how spectroscopically guided simulation pro-vides essential insight into protein-substrate and protein-protein interactions in biosynthetic enzyme complexes and paves the way for equivalent interactions to be incorporated into biomimetic catalysts for challenging reactions. 4. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS Protein Structure and Preparation. Chain A of the crystal structure of a SyrB2 dimer (PDB code 2FCT14) was used for simulation with crystallizing agents removed. The structure was missing two residues at the N-terminus, which were omitted (i.e., the third residue was treated as the N-terminal residue), but a second loop of four missing residues (I57, S58, G59, G60) was added back by hand in PyMOL.73 The thiolation (T) domain of SyrB1 (residues 538-609) was homology modeled against an ACP (PDB code 2KR5,58 sequence identity 28%, model confidence 99.6%) using Phyre74 and equilibrated to remove steric clashes (see equilibration protocol next). The charge states of SyrB2 and SyrB1 apoenzymes were assigned using the H++ Web server75-77 assuming a pH of 7.0 with all other defaults applied (Supporting Information Tables S33 and S34). After manual charge assignment of residues adjacent to cofactors/ substrates, the SyrB2 holoenzyme (apoenzyme) has a net charge of -12 (-11), and SyrB1 holo/apo forms both have a net charge of -2 (Supporting Information Tables S33 and S34). The SyrB2/SyrB1 complex was obtained by aligning S570 of equilibrated SyrB1 to the Ser residue of a previously docked34 Ser-PPant-S-Thr structure in SyrB2. This procedure was repeated for Nva and Aba substrates in the three active site configurational isomers equatorial-NO (eq-NO), axial-NO (ax-NO), and axial-\u03b1KG (ax-\u03b1KG) and prepared for simulation with AMBER78 using the tleap utility (Supporting Informa-tion). For nonstandard residues (\u03b1KG, NO, and PPant), we use the generalized AMBER force field (GAFF)79 with restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charges80 obtained at the Hartree-Fock/6-31G* 81 level using GAMESS-US,82 as implemented by the R.E.D.S. Web server.83-85 Cl86 and Fe(II) parameters87 were obtained from the literature, and standard parameters were used for Fe(II)-coordinating H116 and H235 residues. In eq-NO, Cl-and Fe(II) partial charges were rescaled to -0.5 e and +1.5 e, respectively, to improve sampling dynamics, consistent with recommendations in MM modeling of ions.88 The complex was solvated in a periodic rectangular prism box with at least a 10 \u00c5 buffer of TIP3P89 water and neutralized with 14 Na+ counterions for a total simulation of 48 954-48 957 atoms (5998-6001 protein/ substrate atoms). MM Equilibration and Dynamics. The complexes were equilibrated with MM MD using the GPU-accelerated PMEMD code in AMBER.78 Equilibration steps were (i) restrained (1000 steps) and unrestrained (2000 steps) minimizations, (ii) 10 ps NVT heating to 300 K with a Langevin thermostat with collision frequency of 5.0 ps-1 and a random seed, and (iii) 1 ns NpT equilibration using the Berendsen barostat with a pressure relaxation time of 2 ps. The ACS Catalysis Research Article DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.9b00865 ACS Catal. 2019, 9, 4930-4943 4938 core active site was held fixed throughout the simulation with 200 kcal/(mol\u00b7\u00c52) bond distance force constants around experimental crystal structure14 values (Supporting Informa-tion Table S35). Unrestrained production dynamics were collected for at least 250 ns for each active site configurational isomer and substrate combination (Supporting Information Table S36). The SHAKE algorithm90 was applied with a 2 fs time step for all MD, and the particle mesh Ewald method was used for long-range electrostatics with a 10 \u00c5 electrostatic cutoff. Restrained MD Dynamics. Snapshots in which a weighted average of the core-substrate distances and angles sampled were closest to target values from free production MM dynamics were chosen for subsequent restrained dynamics (see files in Supporting Information and Supporting Information Tables S37-S38). Starting from step ii of the equilibration procedure, harmonic restraints were added to enforce the target distances and angles between the active site Fe and N and the methyl and methylene/hydroxymethylene carbon atoms of the substrate, as obtained from experimental HYSCORE data52 with the flat portion of the restraint corresponding to reported values and their uncertainties52 (Supporting Information Tables S37 and S38). These restraints were then adjusted iteratively in 10\u00b0 or 0.1 \u00c5 increments to enforce sampling of target distances (Supporting Information Table S39). Umbrella Sampling and Analysis. MD free energy surfaces were obtained for the SyrB2 F196 channel-gating mechanism by applying the weighted-histogram analysis method (WHAM)91,92 using the Grossfield software package93 to unbias distributions obtained with umbrella sampling.94 In total, 400 ps NpT equilibration and 200 ps NpT production was obtained for each equally spaced window. Over the \u03c71 = -180\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 and \u03c72 = 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 ranges in F196 dihedrals, 5\u00b0 windows were sampled with targets enforced by 200 kcal/ (mol\u00b7rad2) force constants. The WHAM free energy weights were converged to within 1 \u00d7 10-8. For each relevant configuration, 50 representative snapshots were extracted and analyzed with CAVER59 to quantify cavities, with a probe radius of 1.0 \u00c5, shell radius of 5.5 \u00c5, shell depth of 7.0 \u00c5, and a starting point in the center of the protein active site. We verified visually that the cavity was between the protein exterior and the active site via F196, which was also the largest detected cavity in most cases. The overall cavity bottleneck was extracted directly from CAVER output, and the sphere radius in the path closest to the C\u03b2 of F196 was used to determine the cavity radius at F196. Analysis of MD Trajectories. Snapshots from trajectories spaced 16 ps apart were clustered by rmsd on heavy atoms in the PPant/substrate using a bottom-up approach with minimum distance between clusters of 4 \u00c5 and the average linkage algorithm and a target of five clusters based on guidelines in ref 95. Interaction analysis employed the AMBER MMPBSA.py96 utility, which follows protocols outlined in ref 97. This analysis used the generalized Born (GB)98 approximation on snapshots obtained from MD with a noncovalent ligand present and rigidly removed for up to 625 snapshots from a cluster spaced 2 ps frames apart. Pairwise residue interactions and residue electrostatic and van der Waals\u2019 contributions to binding were computed using the \u201cOBC1\u201d model,99 as suggested by benchmarks.100 Geometric hydrogen bonding strength and other computed distances and angles in the active site were obtained with the ptraj utility in AMBER.78 QM/MM or QM-Only Simulation and Analysis. Snap-shots from MD production runs were extracted for QM/MM geometry optimizations. The periodic box was postprocessed using PyMOL73 to generate the largest spherical droplet centered around each protein and prepared with tleap to enforce spherical cap boundary conditions with a restraining potential of 1.5 kcal/(mol\u00b7\u00c52). All QM/MM simulations were carried out using TeraChem101,102 for the QM portion as was previously motivated.103 The 382-atom (410 with link atoms) QM region (net charge of -1, spin multiplicity of 6) was selected with systematic analysis104-106 of PPant/protein interactions (Supporting Information Table S40). The QM region is modeled with unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) using the range-separated hybrid \u03c9PBEh107 (\u03c9 = 0.2 bohr-1) with an LANL2DZ effective core potential108 on Fe and 6-31G* 81 for the remaining atoms. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) bond critical points (BCPs)70 were identified with Multiwfn109 on QM/MM snapshots, and HB energies were estimated from the potential energy density of the closest BCP.110 QM-only optimizations were carried out at the same level of theory on minimal models of the PPant-bound substrate (i.e., to the thioester linkage, which was capped with CH3) and protein residues (H-capped N123, Y66, E102, and E271). Structures were extracted from protein snapshots for optimizations in which the backbone atoms (i.e., C\u03b1, N, C, O in the residue, methyl C for the substrate) were either free or constrained, and the protein environment was mimicked with the COSMO111,112 implicit solvent model (\u03b5 = 4).

        "ABSTRACT: Biosynthetic enzyme complexes selectively cata-lyze challenging chemical transformations, including alkane functionalization (e.g., halogenation of threonine, Thr, by the non-heme iron halogenase SyrB2). However, the role of complex formation in enabling reactivity and guiding selectivity is poorly understood, owing to the challenges associated with obtaining detailed structural information on the dynamically associating protein complexes. Combining over 10 \u03bcs of classical molecular dynamics of SyrB2 and the acyl carrier protein SyrB1 with large-scale QM/MM simulation, we investigate the substrate-protein and protein-protein dynam-ics that give rise to experimentally observed substrate positioning and reactivity trends. We confirm the presence of a hypothesized substrate-delivery channel in SyrB2 through free energy simulations that show channel opening with a low free energy barrier. We identify stabilizing interactions at the SyrB2/SyrB1 interface that are compatible with phosphopantetheine (PPant) delivery of substrate to SyrB2. By sampling metal-substrate distances observed in experimental spectroscopy of native SyrB2/SyrB1-PPant-S-Thr and non-native substrates, we characterize essential protein-substrate interactions that are responsible for substrate positioning, and thus, reactivity. We observe the hydroxyl side chain and terminal amine of the native Thr substrate to form cooperative hydrogen bonds with a single N123 residue in SyrB2. In comparison, non-native substrates that lack the hydroxyl interact more flexibly with the protein and therefore can orient closer to the Fe center, explaining their preferential hydroxylation.

INTRODUCTION Mononuclear non-heme iron enzymes1-6 have attracted great interest for their ability to selectively functionalize otherwise unreactive C-H bonds, playing an essential role in biosyn-thesis pathways that produce clinically relevant natural products.7 As a result, the development of mimetic inorganic complexes of these enzymes has been an area of intense focus.8-12 Non-heme iron enzymes differ from their mimetics by operating under a distinct catalytic paradigm in which the enzyme environment protects a deeply buried but reactive metal center and controls specificity in part through substrate delivery.1-6 One such enzyme is SyrB2,13,14 an Fe/\u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG)-dependent halogenase13-20 from Pseudo-monas syringae in which the Fe(II) center is coordinated by two protein His, one Cl, and \u03b1KG. Once activated21 by substrate delivery via a prosthetic phosphopantetheine (PPant) arm attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) SyrB1,13 SyrB2 chlorinates the C4 position of a native L-Thr substrate. Halogenases like SyrB2 share structural and mechanistic commonalities with well-studied, non-heme iron hydroxy-lases.15,22 In both hydroxylases and halogenases, an Fe(IV)\ue0c8O intermediate forms, which carries out H atom abstraction followed by either hydroxylation or halogenation, respectively.1,13,14,21,23-28 For hydroxylases a 2His/1(Asp/ Glu) facial triad29,30 is essential for hydroxylation, whereas the Asp is replaced with Ala or Gly in halogenases to enable Cl binding to the metal center. Although Ala to Asp mutation in SyrB2 leads to some L-Thr hydroxylation,14 and replacement of Cl with N donors has catalyzed C-N bond formation,31 these substitutions alone do not confer native enzyme efficiency.",
        "Although substrate selectivity is governed in part by the ability of SyrB1 to link the amino acid residue substrate (Res) to PPant and form a PPant-S-Res moiety, non-native substrates that differ from Thr by lacking its hydroxyl side chain (i.e., aminobutyric acid or Aba) and/or containing a longer carbon chain (i.e., norvaline or Nva) have been successfully tethered to SyrB1/PPant.32 Reactivity studies32 on these substrates have revealed surprising reactivity patterns: H atom abstraction occurs up to 130\u00d7 faster for non-native substrates, concomitant with an increase in rebound hydroxylation",

        "propensity over native halogenation. Thus, it appears that SyrB2 has a substrate-specific catalytic inefficiency for the native substrate that coincides with halogenation being favored over hydroxylation.32 This unexpected behavior has sparked vigorous computational33-38 and spectroscopic39,40 study of SyrB2 to better understand its unexpected reactivity. One suggestion18,37,40,41 has been that configurational isomerization of the active site, during18 or after formation of the oxo intermediate,38,41 reorients Cl to an axial position to make it more accessible for halogenation. However, this mechanism still requires some substrate-specific protein interaction and thus positioning that would enable isomerization for one substrate (e.g., Thr) while disfavoring it for others (e.g., Nva, Aba).",
        "Challenges remain in understanding the role that the greater protein and protein-protein complex must play in SyrB2/ SyrB1 reactivity. The crystal structure of SyrB214 was obtained with no obvious channel for substrate delivery, and SyrB1 has not been crystallographically characterized in isolation or in complex with SyrB2. Advances in structural characterization by cross-linking enzyme/ACP complexes42 and forming inter-mediate analogues,43 e.g., vanadyl44,45 intermediate mimics, have provided insight through static snapshots into protein-protein interactions or active site rearrangements during the catalytic cycle of related enzymes. Computational modeling can provide complementary insight into transient interactions and in cases where structural characterization is incomplete. However, most modeling has been carried out on cluster models of SyrB2 with few exceptions,36,38 despite the wider use of whole-protein multiscale modeling for other non-heme iron enzymes.46-51 To date, no SyrB2/SyrB1 complexes have been simulated, with the largest models using truncated34,36-38 PPant-S-Thr models placed in SyrB2 by rotating or mutating F196.",
        "Shedding insight into structural features of the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex, Silakov and co-workers52 recently employed hyper-fine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE)53 spectroscopy to estimate average positions and angles of PPant-loaded substrate methyl and methylene/hydroxymethylene carbons with respect to the iron center in the active site of the SyrB2/ SyrB1 complex, similar to previous efforts that had provided insight into non-heme iron hydroxylases.54,55 This analysis provided a basis for observed reactivity patterns,32 previously only inferred32 or suggested from simulation34 to be a consequence of positioning, by identifying a greater distance between Fe and the native Thr substrate than non-native Nva or Aba. Although providing essential quantitative insight into substrate/active-site positioning, the HYSCORE models cannot be used to determine which protein-substrate interactions give rise to these observed positions or which configurational isomer the active site samples when the distances are measured.",
        "The role of the greater protein environment in conferring differences in substrate-specific reactivity thus remains unknown in SyrB2. In this work, we employ long-time classical molecular dynamics (MD) and large-scale quantum mechan-ics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulation to reveal the nature of the protein-protein and protein-substrate inter-actions that confer reactivity and selectivity in the SyrB2/ SyrB1 complex. These simulations provide detailed informa-tion about how differences between the orientation of the native Thr substrate and those of non-native Nva or Aba result from distinct interactions between Thr and active-site residues. These data represent the first guidance on protein-substrate interactions that govern positioning and reactivity in SyrB2 and reveal the enzyme-specific origins of divergent reactivity. Beyond SyrB2/SyrB1, the protocol described here to use experimental guidance of local active site interactions in dynamics simulations is anticipated to be broadly useful for other multiprotein complexes, e.g., the PPant-dependent halogenase CytC315,16,56 that has only been crystallized in an inactive form, as well as in carrier-protein-free enzymes (e.g., WelO5).18",
        "2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION",
        "2.a. Dynamics of Isolated SyrB2 and SyrB1 Proteins. SyrB1, a member of the ACP family, contains two domains,13,57 the adenylation, or A, domain and a thiolation, or T, domain. The T domain is responsible for delivering substrate to SyrB2 via a PPant arm that is connected by a phosphate group to a Ser residue in SyrB1 (Figure 1).",
        "Although SyrB1 has not been crystallographically character-ized, ACP T domains are highly conserved, and homology modeling of the SyrB1 T domain based on a related ACP58 afforded a stable structure as evaluated over 500 ns of dynamics (see Computational Details). In solution, the PPant-S-Thr arm on SyrB1 samples a very broad conformational ensemble, characterized by the radius of gyration, Rg, defined from the phosphate group to the terminal carbon of the Thr substrate, having a peak below 4 \u00c5 but a broad overall distribution from 3.5 to more than 7.0 \u00c5 (Figure 1 and Supporting Information Figure S1). In the smallest Rg configurations, the substrate curls on itself, minimizing solvent exposure, whereas the largest Rg values correspond to an extended, nearly linear configuration of PPant (Figure 1 and Supporting Information Figure S2 and Table S1). The observations on the MD ensemble suggest that PPant frequently samples bent, compact configurations but will extend with a small barrier (\u223c1.5 kcal/mol) to form a configuration slightly higher in free energy (\u223c0.5 kcal/mol) that is compatible with docking to SyrB2. This analysis is consistent with the modest fraction (\u223c20%) of the NMR ensemble58 of the ACP on which SyrB1 was homology modeled in which the PPant structure is extended (Supporting Information Table S2 and Figure S3).",
        "In comparison to free SyrB1 PPant, PPant dynamics in a docked SyrB2/SyrB1 complex show a considerably narrower Rg distribution centered around 6.7 \u00c5 (Figure 1). The",
        "Figure 1. (a) Normalized histograms of Rg (in \u00c5) for PPant evaluated",
        "configurations sampled in the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex are consistent with the elongated local minimum observed in free SyrB1 dynamics, and overall geometries are comparable (Supporting Information Figure S2 and Table S1). Thus, at room temperature, SyrB1 likely samples geometries that enable SyrB2/SyrB1 docking through PPant/substrate chain elonga-tion, although this configuration is not the global minimum for isolated SyrB1 PPant in solution. This computational characterization of ACP dynamics in a SyrB1 model provides important insight into SyrB2/SyrB1 complexation in the absence of prior crystallographic characterization.",
        "The SyrB2 holoenzyme\u2019s crystal structure has been obtained14 with no apparent opening for SyrB1 to deliver substrate to the SyrB2 active site. It has been proposed14 that rotation of a phenylalanine residue (F196) could allow PPant and substrate to access the non-heme Fe(II) active site, but it is unknown if the free energy landscape and dynamics of residues surrounding F196 would then allow substrate delivery by PPant. Here, we employ long-time MD and umbrella sampling to quantify structural properties and free energies of SyrB2 protein configurations that enable substrate delivery to the active site. In the crystal structure, F196 in SyrB2 closes the channel entry to the active site with a \u03c71, \u03c72 dihedral pair of (-42\u00b0, 98\u00b0), where \u03c71 represents the rotation of F196 about the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 axis, and \u03c72 represents the tilt of F196 with respect to the backbone with 180\u00b0 periodicity due to symmetry in the phenyl ring (Figure 2 inset and Supporting Information Figure S4).",
        "We first carried out over 1.6 \u03bcs of aggregate MD simulations of SyrB2 starting from the experimental structure and nine other rotameric states of F196 (Supporting Information Table S3 and Figure S5). Six of the simulations exclusively sampled in the vicinity of the crystal structure F196 configuration, albeit with broad distributions having widths of 60\u00b0 in \u03c71 and 90\u00b0 in \u03c72 (Supporting Information Figure S6). Without apparent dependence on starting rotamer, four other simulations sampled a number of distinct rotameric states, with multiple nanosecond time scale transitions observed during each 250 ns simulation (Supporting Information Figure S7).",
        "To identify the relative free energy of metastable F196 rotameric states, we then computed the two-dimensional free energy surface (FES) defined by \u03c71 and \u03c72 of F196 (see Computational Details). Consistent with the equilibrium MD simulations, the crystal structure minimum is observed to be the FES global minimum, but other local minima are evident (Figure 2). Namely, a second minimum near (-165\u00b0, 95\u00b0) is about 1 kcal/mol above the global minimum. The path connecting the two minima corresponds to rotation of the F196 phenyl ring around the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 axis without significant change in the tilt of the ring and is characterized by a 2.5 kcal/ mol free energy barrier (i.e., \u03c71 variation with fixed \u03c72, Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure S8).",
        "To confirm that this second minimum corresponds to an open, active-site-accessible configuration of SyrB2 in compar-ison to the closed crystal structure configuration, we carried out cavity analysis59 that has previously been fruitfully applied to related non-heme iron dioxygenases60 (see Computational Details). In the crystal configuration, the cavity connecting the solvated exterior of SyrB2 and the Fe(II)-centered active site appears pinched at F196, with a large number of MD snapshots having a cavity radius at the C\u03b2 of F196 of only approximately 1.2 \u00c5 (Figure 2). Repeating this analysis on the (-165\u00b0, 95\u00b0) local minimum reveals a uniformly wider cavity with a radius of approximately 2.5 \u00c5 at the C\u03b2 of F196 (Figure 2). Analysis on the overall bottleneck of the channel, rather than just the width at the F196 C\u03b2, shows consistent results (Supporting Information Figure S9). Thus, rotation of F196 about the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 axis, which likely occurs on nanosecond time scales, will make substrate delivery to the active site possible.",
        "We also evaluated the F196 dihedral in a SyrB2/SyrB1 complex to identify how F196 orientations and the channel might change in the presence of PPant and the SyrB2/SyrB1 interface. Overall, the \u03c71 distribution is unchanged, but the average value of \u03c72 decreases slightly, indicative of a tilting of the phenyl ring that would have a small free-energy cost in isolated SyrB2 (Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure S10). Cavity analysis on the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex with SyrB1 removed reveals an enlarged cavity in the complex with a radius of approximately 3.4 \u00c5 to accommodate PPant and substrate (Figure 2). The slight change in F196 tilt can only partly explain the enlargement, as cavity analysis of SyrB2-only configurations with the shifted dihedral of the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex only increases the peak of the radius distribution at",

        "the C\u03b2 of F196 by approximately 0.4 \u00c5 (Supporting Information Figure S11). Comparing SyrB2 in the SyrB2/ SyrB1 complex with isolated SyrB2 in the open or closed configuration indeed reveals additional differences beyond just F196 rotation. Namely, the F196-containing loop moves to open the cavity, a short N62-N65 \u03b1-helix is displaced, and an adjacent I57-G59 loop reorients (Supporting Information Figure S12). These motions all contribute to enlarging the cavity for PPant/substrate delivery upon complexation.",
        "2.b. SyrB2/SyrB1 Interface Interactions and Dynam-ics. After docking SyrB1-PPant-S-Thr to an open configuration of SyrB2, the overall complex is stable, without significant increases in center-of-mass distances between the two proteins over long-time dynamics (Supporting Information Figure S13). Classical energy decomposition analysis (i.e., generalized Born or GBSA; see Computational Details) reveals that several protein-protein interface interactions stabilize the complex. Favorable interactions are predominantly electrostatic in nature and occur at the interface of flexible loops and small helices on SyrB2 with adjacent residues on SyrB1 that were shown to shift upon complexation (Supporting Information Figure S12 and Table S4). The strongest such interactions occur between SyrB1 D589 and SyrB2 S58 and in the form of a salt bridge between SyrB1 R575 and SyrB2 D181 (Supporting Information Tables S4 and S5). This model of the SyrB2/ SyrB1 interface provides targets for experimental mutagenesis to stabilize a long-lived SyrB2/SyrB1 complex (Supporting Information Figure S14).",
        "Within the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex, the PPant arm forms a number of favorable stabilizing interactions with the SyrB2 cavity, as judged through geometric hydrogen bonding (HB) and GBSA analysis. These interactions are distributed along the 14 \u00c5 length of the PPant. The PPant phosphate group hydrogen bonds at the SyrB2 surface with N184, which also participates in SyrB2/SyrB1 interface interactions (Figure 3).",
        "Favorable van der Waals interactions are observed between the gating F196 and PPant as well as the adjacent F195 (Figure 3 and Supporting Information Table S5). HB analysis reveals a strong interaction between an E111 HB acceptor and a PPant hydroxyl (\u223c2.6-2.7 \u00c5) with high frequency (>70% of all MD snapshots, Supporting Information Table S6). The SyrB2 S185 is a HB donor (40%) to the PPant phosphate, and N62 is a HB donor to a carbonyl in a PPant amide bond with a longer bond length (2.8-2.9 \u00c5) that means it is detected less frequently (6%, Supporting Information Table S7).",
        "In recent HYSCORE experiments by Silakov and co-workers,52 an Fe-bound NO molecule provided an EPR-active probe, revealing that native Thr substrates are positioned further from the metal center than non-native substrates as judged by the distance of iron to the closest terminal hydrogen atoms (Thr, 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5; Nva, 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5; Aba, 3.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5).52 Overall, the substrates were observed to be at an acute angle to the Fe-N bond (85 \u00b1 10\u00b0 for Thr/Aba and 64 \u00b1 7\u00b0 for Nva52), but these distances and angles leave open several possibilities for how the substrate could be oriented in the active site given ongoing uncertainty over the configurational isomer of the active site37,38,41,52 (Supporting Information Figure S15).",
        "In the absence of available high-resolution crystal structures, MD simulation of the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex is expected to provide valuable insight into substrate delivery, substrate-protein interactions that drive substrate specificity, and dynamics at the SyrB2 active site. However, the noncovalent interactions that govern the substrate-protein positioning in the active site are notoriously difficult to describe correctly with standard, point-charge force fields.61-67 Indeed, micro-second-length MD of SyrB1-PPant loaded with each of the three substrates in combination with the three most probable active-site configurational isomers seldom samples the HYSCORE distances or angles, instead favoring a broad distribution (approximately 4-11 \u00c5 and up to 15 \u00c5 for Aba substrates) of terminal methyl H atom (Me) to Fe distances (Fe-Me, Supporting Information Table S8). The experimen-tally observed, substrate specific Fe-Me distance trend (i.e., Thr > Aba > Nva) can be discerned from the minimum sampled distances in any of the configurational isomers but is not preserved for the average sampled distances (Supporting Information Table S8).",
        "Unlike experiments52 that show longer methylene hydrogen (Mt) atom distances to Fe (i.e., Fe-Mt) in comparison to Fe-Me (\u223c1.0 \u00c5 for Aba and substantial for Nva), MD-sampled distances are instead comparable (Supporting Information Table S8). Longer Fe-Me and Fe-Mt distances lead to sampling of a wide range of Fe-N-Me and Fe-N-Mt angles (0-125\u00b0) in all configurational isomers. At these longer distances, equatorial (eq)-NO configurations are more likely than axial (ax)-NO to sample the experimental Fe-N-Me and Fe-N-Mt angles regardless of substrate (Supporting Information Figures S16-S22 and Table S8). In cases where free dynamics of ax-\u03b1KG samples better distances, such as for Nva and Aba substrates, agreement with experimental angles worsens (Supporting Information Figures S23 and S24).",
        "Over all sampled configurations, no substrate/configura-tional isomer combination yields a structure with all four distances and angles within the experimental measurement uncertainty. However, configurations close to the experimental values are infrequently observed, especially for Thr, which had the longest experimental target distances (Figure 4 and Supporting Information Figure S15 and Tables S9-S17). To overcome limitations of classical MD that often prevent the sampling of short noncovalent interactions,66-68 we therefore turn to enforcing the HYSCORE distances and identifying the protein-substrate interactions favored in configurations that satisfy experimental restraints.",
        "2.c. Restrained MD Identifies Protein-Substrate Interactions. Adjusted restraints (see Computational Details) were used to enforce experimentally observed52 distances and angles. In all cases, reasonable structures were achieved",
        "Figure 3. Schematic of key hydrogen bonding interactions (blue",
        "without any apparent distortion of the bond lengths and angles of the substrate or the active site, supporting the reported experimental values as feasible in the active SyrB2/SyrB1 complex for any of the configurational isomers. In all cases, the Fe-Me distances are sampled more readily, and all target distances are most easily satisfied in the crystal-structure-like ax-NO isomers (Figure 5 and Supporting Information Figures S25-S33). Our observation is in contrast to earlier motivations52 for alternative configurational isomers to the ax-NO crystal structure analogue based on the expectation that acute Fe-N-Me/Mt angles would be hard to satisfy at such short distances in the ax-NO isomer. Average distances and angles preserve observed HYSCORE trends52 in all isomers, suggesting we cannot immediately rule out any of the configurational isomers as incompatible with the spectroscopi-cally inferred distances and angles52 (Figure 5 and Supporting Information Table S18). An open question is whether target distances may be satisfied in only one substrate orientation. Most distance and angle distributions are approximately normal with a single distinct pose (e.g., for Nva or Thr in ax/eq-NO isomers) except for Aba that samples multiple configurations as indicated by analysis of representative poses (Figure 5 and Supporting Information Figures S27, S30, and S33 and Table S19). This difference in Aba corresponds to its ability to satisfy Fe-Me target distances with both gauche and trans dihedral (i.e., N(H3 +)-C-C(Mt)-C(Me)) angles (Supporting Information Table S19 and structures provided in the Supporting Information).",
        "To determine which favorable protein-substrate interac-tions underlie the experimentally observed substrate position-ing and, secondarily, to rationalize why these distances were not predominantly sampled in free MD, we analyze and compare interaction energies (i.e., GBSA) and hydrogen bonding strengths of the trajectories (see Computational Details). In the ax/eq-NO isomers, strong interactions (i.e., from GBSA or HB analysis) are observed between all substrates and polar, neutral residues (i.e., N62, Y66, N123, and Y272). This is in contrast to unrestrained MD, in which interactions with charged residues (i.e., E102, E271) dominate, as well as to prior computational modeling37,38,40 that had sampled substrate positioning in the active site without enforcing HYSCORE distances and angles52 (Supporting Information Figure S34). These interactions are reduced in strength in the restrained MD of Thr/Nva and absent in the case of Aba (Supporting Information Tables S12-S17 and S20-S25). For Thr, HYSCORE-restrained MD shifts -OH HBs to N123 instead of E102, which instead interacts with the NH3 + group (Supporting Information Tables S15 and S22). Poor sampling of experimentally observed52 distances in free MD can be attributed to limitations of point charge force fields.61-67 The critical role of N123 in substrate positioning will be revisited in the following section.",
        "Although all three configurational isomers can support the experimentally observed distances, observations thus far",
        "Figure 4. Representative frames from classical MD that correspond most closely to experimentally observed distances for Thr in three",
        "suggest eliminating ax-\u03b1KG as a probable isomer. With respect to other configurational isomers, fewer protein-substrate interactions are observed in ax-\u03b1KG: the NH3 + groups of Nva and Aba form no substantial HBs and, when present, the Thr -OH/E102 HB prevents E102 from cooperatively interacting with NH3 +, which occurs readily in other isomers (Supporting Information Tables S14-S17 and S22-S25). Additionally, the larger \u03b1KG (vs NO or Cl) in the axial position orients the substrate, and the NH3 + group in particular, away from enzyme active-site residues (Supporting Information Figure S35). These structural differences also explain the difficulty with which Fe-Mt distances and angles were satisfied in this isomer (Figure 5). Although ax-\u03b1KG has been observed in clavaminate synthase,69 this alternative active-site configuration for SyrB2 was proposed in the context of the expected difficulty of satisfying the restraint distances with crystal structure analogue ax-NO. Given the lack of disproportionate support for eq-NO or ax-\u03b1KG in our work, we focus on the crystal-structure analogue ax-NO isomer for further consideration of substrate-specific differences, with alternative isomer data provided in the Supporting Informa-tion.",
        "In experimentally guided simulations, Fe-Me and Fe-Mt distances appear to be related to the depth at which substrates sit in the active-site cavity. We now define a quantitative measure of the depth of the PPant-substrate delivery to SyrB2 to provide more insight into substrate-active-site interactions. After identifying immobile regions of the protein, we selected two subsets of \u03b2-sheet residues, over which we track the center of mass of all C\u03b1 atoms to serve as reference points: B11, M249-V256; B12, Y255-V256 (Supporting Information Figure S36). In addition to following the same \u03b2-sheet strand, these two points run adjacent to the vector along which PPant enters SyrB2, with B12 corresponding to greater active-site depth than B11. Thus, substrate delivery depth can be judged by relative distance to B11 and B12, dB12-dB11, where smaller values correspond to deeper substrate delivery. As expected, smaller dB12-dB11 values for the Me carbon of Thr (i.e., 2.7 \u00c5 average in ax-NO) than for Nva or Aba (i.e., around 3.5-3.6 \u00c5) indicate deeper substrate delivery for Thr (Figure 6 and Supporting Information Table S26). The dB12-dB11 values for the N in NH3 + rank the substrates as Thr < Aba < Nva (i.e., 2.6 \u00c5 Thr average in ax-NO vs 3.2 and 4.5 \u00c5 for Aba and Nva), indicating the native substrate is distinguished by positioning away from the axial NO species and deeper into the active site (Figure 6 and Supporting Information Table S26). In comparison to these observations on ax-NO, eq-NO and ax-\u03b1KG isomers do not preserve these trends, positioning Thr equivalently to either Nva or Aba Me C, respectively, due to shallower and broader overall positioning of substrates in the active sites, especially for ax-\u03b1KG (Supporting Information Table S26 and Figure S36).",
        "It has been argued32,34,52 that substrate-and atom-specific hydroxylation/halogenation branching ratios result from substrate positioning: suboptimal proximity to the Fe(IV)\ue0c8O intermediate should lead to chlorination rather than rebound hydroxylation. The C-to-N distance clearly distinguishes substrates with Nva \u226a Aba < Thr for both ax-NO and eq-NO (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Table S27). At the same time, for both ax-NO and eq-NO configurations, distances of the methyl C to Cl span a narrow 3-4 \u00c5 range, with all substrates having average distances of around 3.3-3.5 \u00c5 (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Table S27 and Figures S38 and S39). The enforcement of experimentally observed Fe-Me/Mt distances and Fe-N-Me/Mt angles provides an indirect enforcement of this order, but C-N or C-Cl distances have not been constrained in any way.",
        "According to previous experimental studies, the methylene carbon (C4) of Nva reacts similarly to the methylene carbon of Aba in terms of both rates and branching ratios with both carbon atoms undergoing a mixture of hydroxylation and chlorination.32 Similar orientations with respect to the Fe center have also been indicated,52 and thus in our experimentally restrained simulations the Nva C4 has similar",

        "C-Cl and C-N distance distributions to Aba (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Figure S40). This correspondence is clearest in the ax-NO isomer (Supporting Information Figure S40). In comparison, the methylene and hydroxymethylene carbons of Aba and Thr, respectively, sample much longer C-N distances in both isomers (Supporting Information Figure S41).",
        "Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that increased halogenation of Thr with lower turnover rates32,52 is governed by longer Thr (vs Nva or Aba) distances to the oxo species rather than reduced distances to Cl (Figure 7). Both ax-NO and eq-NO isomers obey this trend, indicating that the active-site configuration does not control relative C-Cl vs C-N distance (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Figure S40).",
        "2.d. Analysis of Substrate-Dependent Hydrogen Bonding. Although we have shown that experimentally observed distances could be enforced in dynamics, longer distances were preferred in free dynamics. Owing to the limitations of point charge force fields, we therefore turn to QM/MM geometry optimizations to further characterize active site interactions and to determine if the experimentally observed substrate/active-site positions are favorable at the QM/MM level of theory. Over nearly 50 QM/MM geometry optimizations, the distances and angles remained close to the experimental distances, with up to 0.15 \u00c5 elongation in the Fe-Me distance, especially for Nva or Aba in the ax-NO and eq-NO isomers (Supporting Information Table S28). This elongation corresponds to a small change (typically, a decrease) in the Fe-N-Me angle (approximately 5-10\u00b0) with similar or smaller changes to the Mt distances and angles (Supporting Information Table S28). In comparison, Thr Fe-Me/Mt distances elongate only slightly (\u223c0.01 \u00c5 on average), and angle changes are also smaller (Supporting Information Table S28).",
        "Having confirmed that we are able to sample experimentally observed distances, we now turn to analyzing substrate/active-site interactions through QM/MM simulation. We particularly focus on electronic structure properties by using bond critical points (BCPs70) from quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM, see Computational Details) to identify and quantify the strength of HB interactions. QM analysis of HBs between the substrates and the greater protein active site largely confirms observations based on classical geometric HB analysis but provides additional insight (Supporting Information Tables S15-S17 and S22-S24). Notably, Thr forms addi-tional HBs in the ax-NO configuration, as judged by QM analysis after QM/MM optimization, that were not observed in geometric analysis alone (Supporting Information Figure S42 and Table S29). The HB between the side chain amide H of N123 and Thr -OH that was observed in geometric analysis is confirmed here with an estimated -7.2 kcal/mol stabilizing interaction with an O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H distance of 1.9 \u00c5 (Supporting Information Table S29). In addition, a second strong interaction of -5.2 kcal/mol is simultaneously observed between the carbonyl O of the N123 side chain and the NH3 + of the Thr substrate with approximately 2.2 \u00c5 O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H separation (Figure 8 and Supporting Information Table S29). Aba also interacts with N123 in the ax-NO configurational isomer, but the single HB (d = 1.9 \u00c5) between the carbonyl O of N123 and Aba\u2019s NH3 + of -6.9 kcal/mol is much weaker than the sum of the two cooperative interactions for Thr (Supporting Information Table S29). The single interaction with the NH3 + functional group also allows Aba to position closer to the Fe center than the simultaneous interactions do in the case of Thr, as we will discuss next (Figure 8 and Supporting Information Table S29). The same closer position-ing of Nva due to a single interaction with NH3 + is also observed, but the HB interactions are formed instead with Y66, E102, and E271 (Supporting Information Table S29). No HBs are detected for the Nva substrate in the ax-\u03b1KG isomer, and no OH-specific HBs are detected for Thr, in comparison to those present in the other two isomers, meaning that an alternative explanation would be required to explain the experimentally observed distances (see Supporting Information Table S29).",
        "To further quantify the unique HB configuration observed in Thr, we extracted for QM/MM optimization MD snapshots at varying Thr NH3 +/N123 carbonyl distances that were identified less frequently as HBs by classical analysis (Supporting Information Table S30). For MD snapshots with two initially short HBs, QM/MM optimization preserves the double HB configuration and exhibits total HB energies as large as -21 kcal/mol for the shortest QM/MM-stabilized 1.7-1.9 \u00c5 HBs (Supporting Information Table S30). These bond lengths are similar to those in a spectroscopically characterized cooperative hydrogen bonding interaction between formamide and a water chain.71 Optimization of structures with a single HB to the Thr -OH does not result in reorientation to recapture the second HB, as expected from a double well potential (Supporting Information Table S30). In fact, in intermediate orientations, the single HB (d = 1.8 \u00c5) that remains between Thr -OH and N123 amide H (where d = 4.0 \u00c5 for the other HB) can be as strong as -10 kcal/mol, which is stronger than the same interaction in double HB configurations (Supporting Information Table S30).",
        "Although the double HB configuration was not frequently observed in classical geometric HB analysis, such analysis employs a tight heavy atom cutoff (d(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X) = 3.0 \u00c5), and short noncovalent interactions are disfavored by standard force field parameters. Thus, we directly computed the distances of the Thr -OH and -NH3+ to the N123 amide H and carbonyl O throughout MD (Supporting Information Figures S43 and S44). With extensive sampling, we indeed observed distances",
        "Figure 8. Comparison of quantum mechanical properties of hydrogen",
        "consistent with a double HB configuration, although it occurred less frequently than a single HB (Supporting Information Figure S43). Over 1 \u03bcs of dynamics, we estimate the relative free energy of the configurations from their probabilities and find the double HB to be within 1 kcal/mol of the single HB global minimum and separated by a small free energy barrier (Figure 9). Single HB configurations are",
        "strongly preferred in the eq-NO configuration over comparable sampling times (Supporting Information Figure S44). Neither HB to N123 is observed over 500 ns of MD for the ax-\u03b1KG case, with the non-Thr-specific NH3 + HB being the only one that forms appreciably (Supporting Information Figure S44). Analyzing the ax-NO double HB approximate free energies, we conclude that the relative stability of the two configurations is likely sensitive to the force field parameters, and both ax-NO and eq-NO isomers have the potential to favor a double HB configuration with N123 (Figure 9). Although the double HB configuration from classical MD is destabilized by 0.5 kcal/mol with respect to the single HB configuration, MD bias against short noncovalent distances in comparison to computationally expensive QM methods is known to be on the order of several kcal/mol.72 Thus, we shift our focus to the relative QM favorability of the two configurations.",
        "Given that QM HB analysis revealed interactions and distances shorter than had been observed in MD, we investigated the interaction of minimal QM-only models of not just N123 but also the active-site N62, Y66, E102, and E271 residues with truncated PPant-S-Res (Res = Thr, Nva, or Aba) models (Supporting Information Table S31). When the substrates and protein residues are no longer restrained in any way by the protein, Nva and Aba form multiple, strong HBs (d = 1.7-2.0 \u00c5) with N123, including to the backbone carbonyl O (Supporting Information Table S31 and Figure S45). When we freeze backbone atoms of the PPant-S-Res fragment and the protein residues, interactions comparable to the QM/MM model are instead recovered: Nva forms no HBs with N123, instead forming HBs with E271, and Aba forms one only to the side chain carbonyl O atom (Supporting Information Table S32 and Figure S45). Throughout MD, the distance of the amine N of any substrate to the backbone carbonyl O atom is never less than 4.5 \u00c5 (this shortest value is observed only for Aba) for any of the configurational isomers (Supporting Information Figure S46). Thus, it appears that the greater protein environment is essential in positioning N123 to form a double HB with the Thr amine and -OH side chain that is not observed for the non-native substrates (Thr and Aba are compared in Figure 10; Nva is also shown in Supporting Information Figure S45).",
        "On the basis of the distinct HB interactions observed in the native and non-native substrates, it is now possible to rationalize the difference in reactivity based on different substrate positions. Previous experimental and theoretical studies32,34 have emphasized the importance of substrate positioning in the diverging reactivity of SyrB2 for native and non-native substrates and suggested that residues (e.g., R254) could interact with the Fe-OH moiety to prevent rebound hydroxylation for Thr.38 However, substrate-specific hydrogen bonding to the protein that is compatible with HYSCORE-determined52 substrate positioning has not yet been identified (Supporting Information Figure S34). The protein environ-ment provides two strong HBs between the Thr and N123 that are stabilizing by up to 21 kcal/mol (Figure 10). Alternative interactions observed in non-native substrates through only the NH3 + group are smaller (around 15 kcal/mol) and less directional for Aba or involve interacting with multiple residues, e.g., as in Nva with Y66, E102, and E271 (Figure 8). These more flexible interactions with only one functional group on the substrate (i.e., for Nva or Aba) allow the substrate to remain near Fe (Figure 10). The double HB configuration, on the other hand, pulls Thr further away from the Fe in the active site, and consequently from the reactive Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate in the catalytic cycle, but at an optimum distance from Cl thus allowing SyrB2 to favor chlorination for Thr instead of hydroxylation as in Nva (Figure 10). Prior computational studies had instead identified interactions of Thr with E102, an interaction observed in our unrestrained MD but one that produces substrate orientations inconsistent with HYSCORE angles (Supporting Information Figure S34). Replacing the spectroscopically relevant active site model (i.e., \u03b1KG and bound NO) with the reactive Fe(IV)\ue0c8O/succinate intermediate and carrying out QM/MM geometry optimizations preserves placement of the substrate and hydrogen bonding with N123 suggesting the catalytic",
        "Figure 9. Approximate free energy (in kcal/mol) from -kT ln \u27e8P\u27e9 of",
        "relevance of this interaction (Supporting Information Figure S34).",
        "On the basis of these observations, we would expect mutation of N123 to significantly affect the chlorination of native substrate Thr by the multiprotein assembly SyrB2-SyrB1. Review of the literature allowed us to identify a prior experimental study that showed that the mutation of N123 causes a decrease in production of syringomycin E by SyrB2 as shown by a decrease in antifungal activity. The residual activity after mutation was shown to be 26-30% for N123A in SyrB2,27 potentially due to loss of the critical substrate positioning interaction. This relationship could be explored further through HYSCORE of N123A or N123Q mutants that should influence substrate-active-site distances. The protocol we have described here could likely be even more robustly applied to the halogenase WelO5,18 where an available crystal structure could be readily compared to observed protein-substrate interactions during MD or QM/MM simulation (Supporting Information Figure S47).",
        "3. CONCLUSIONS From well over 10 \u03bcs of MD of both free and complexed SyrB2 and SyrB1 along with large-scale QM/MM simulation, we have investigated the substrate-protein and protein-protein dynamics that give rise to experimentally observed substrate positioning and reactivity trends. First, we confirmed low 2-3 kcal/mol free energy barriers for F196 rotation in SyrB2 to open a channel for substrate delivery. We identified concomitant rearrangement of surface residues on SyrB1 (i.e., N62-N65 and I57-G59) that further widened the substrate delivery cavity when a SyrB1 model was docked to SyrB2, indicating concerted motions that enable substrate delivery. Although in solution the SyrB1 PPant-S-Res arm prefers a closed conformation, the elongated orientation compatible with substrate delivery is also transiently observed in solution. In the context of the SyrB2 channel, PPant is restricted in its motion both due to the shape of the cavity and the formation of interactions with essential residues that stabilize PPant (e.g., N184, F195, F196) and the SyrB2/SyrB1 (e.g., D181/R575 and S58/D589) interface.",
        "Although free dynamics of the SyrB2/SyrB1 complex did not sample experimentally observed substrate-Fe active site distances, HYSCORE-derived52 restraints easily satisfied target distances and angles to enable investigation of protein-substrate interactions. We observed a unique, cooperative pattern of hydrogen bonding that occurred only for the native Thr substrate: both hydroxyl and amine functional groups formed hydrogen bonds with N123. As judged through QM/ MM analysis, this interaction was stronger than any alternative amine-only hydrogen bonding configurations and favored in both spectroscopic Fe-NO/\u03b1KG and catalytic Fe(IV)\ue0c8O/ succinate active site configurations. Conversely, Nva and Aba are only able to form hydrogen bonds to the protein with their amine functional groups, enabling them the flexibility to position closer to the Fe center. This analysis could explain the experimental observations given either an ax-NO or eq-NO active site configuration but not ax-\u03b1KG. Overall, the unique orientation of native Thr corresponded to quantitatively deeper substrate delivery than non-native substrates. All substrates had similar proximity to Cl, but Thr was most distant from the anticipated location of the oxo species.",
        "Although SyrB2/SyrB1 was the focus of the present work, we expect the protocol of using experimental active site interactions to guide dynamics simulations to be broadly useful in natural product biosynthesis pathways. In many such enzymes, either prosthetic-arm-guided substrate positioning is essential or protein-substrate dynamics are anticipated to play a key role. However, capturing these key interactions is often challenging without molecular simulation. This work thus demonstrates how spectroscopically guided simulation pro-vides essential insight into protein-substrate and protein-protein interactions in biosynthetic enzyme complexes and paves the way for equivalent interactions to be incorporated into biomimetic catalysts for challenging reactions.",

        "Protein Structure and Preparation. Chain A of the crystal structure of a SyrB2 dimer (PDB code 2FCT14) was used for simulation with crystallizing agents removed. The structure was missing two residues at the N-terminus, which were omitted (i.e., the third residue was treated as the N-terminal residue), but a second loop of four missing residues (I57, S58, G59, G60) was added back by hand in PyMOL.73 The thiolation (T) domain of SyrB1 (residues 538-609) was homology modeled against an ACP (PDB code 2KR5,58 sequence identity 28%, model confidence 99.6%) using Phyre74 and equilibrated to remove steric clashes (see equilibration protocol next). The charge states of SyrB2 and SyrB1 apoenzymes were assigned using the H++ Web server75-77 assuming a pH of 7.0 with all other defaults applied (Supporting Information Tables S33 and S34). After manual charge assignment of residues adjacent to cofactors/ substrates, the SyrB2 holoenzyme (apoenzyme) has a net charge of -12 (-11), and SyrB1 holo/apo forms both have a net charge of -2 (Supporting Information Tables S33 and S34). The SyrB2/SyrB1 complex was obtained by aligning S570 of equilibrated SyrB1 to the Ser residue of a previously docked34 Ser-PPant-S-Thr structure in SyrB2. This procedure was repeated for Nva and Aba substrates in the three active site configurational isomers equatorial-NO (eq-NO), axial-NO (ax-NO), and axial-\u03b1KG (ax-\u03b1KG) and prepared for simulation with AMBER78 using the tleap utility (Supporting Informa-tion).",
