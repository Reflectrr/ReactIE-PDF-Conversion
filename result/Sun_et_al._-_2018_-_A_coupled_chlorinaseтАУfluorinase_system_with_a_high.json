Commun., 2018, 54, 9458 A coupled chlorinase\u2013fluorinase system with a high efficiency of trans-halogenation and a shared substrate tolerance\u2020 H. Sun, a H. Zhao *ab and E. L. Ang *a Enzymatic trans-halogenation enables radiolabeling under mild and aqueous conditions, but rapid reactions are desired. We developed a coupled chlorinase\u2013fluorinase system for rapid trans-halogenation. Notably, the chlorinase shares a substrate tolerance with the fluorinase, enabling these two enzymes to cooperatively produce 50-fluorodeoxy-2-ethynyladenosine (50-FDEA) in up to 91.6% yield in 1 h. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent nucleophilic halo-genating enzymes are a newly discovered family of halogenases, which convert SAM and fluoride/chloride ions to 50-fluoro-5 0-deoxyadenosine (50-FDA)/50-chloro-50-deoxyadenosine (50-ClDA) and L-methionine (L-Met)1 (Scheme 1A). To date, only five fluorinases2\u20137 and one chlorinase8 within this unique halogenase family have been discovered and characterized. Fluorinases enable selective C\u2013F bond formation under mild conditions in an aqueous phase. The aqueous method of fluorination is especially desirable for positron emission tomo-graphy (PET) application. Aqueous [18F]-fluoride ions generated in a cyclotron from [18O]-water can be utilized directly by the fluorinase, and [18F]-labeling of soluble biomolecules can be readily achieved in a buffer solution near physiological pH.9 Fluorinase-mediated trans-halogenation has emerged as a useful strategy for PET probe synthesis.10\u201312 Fluorinases can catalyze the trans-halogenation of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA in two steps: (1) in situ SAM synthesis from 50-ClDA and L-Met/L-seleno-methionine (L-SeMet) and (2) 50-FDA generation from SAM and fluoride ions.13 Thus, cheap and stable 50-ClDA can be converted to [18F]-50-FDA,14 a potential PET probe that can also be further converted to a wide range of potentially useful probes such as [18F]-fluoroacetate,15 [18F]-fluororibose,16 and [18F]-fluoronucleosides.17 The fluorinase was demonstrated to tolerate the acetylene functionality at the C-2 position of the adenine ring, leading to the conversion of 50-chlorodeoxy-2-ethynyladenosine (50-ClDEA) to 50-fluorodeoxy-2-ethynyladenosine (50-FDEA).10 The acetylene moiety on FDEA enabled a \u2018\u2018click\u2019\u2019 reaction to an azide-bearing arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptide. RGD-based PET tracers with high affinity and specificity for integrin avb3 have been used in clinical trials for tumor detection and staging.18 Fluorinase-mediated trans-halogenation can even be employed for direct radiolabeling of RGD tethered to the C-2 position of the adenine ring.10,12 Due to the short half-life of F-18 (t1/2 = 109.7 min), it is important to develop rapid enzymatic protocols. Our results showed that fluorinase-mediated trans-halogenation is slow even for the fluorinase from Streptomyces xinghaiensis (FlA4), the most efficient fluorinase7 among the Scheme 1 Fluorinase-mediated trans-halogenation and its rate-limiting step.

Commun., 2018, 54, 9458--9461 | 9459 five reported ones (Scheme 1A). Comparing the two separate reaction steps, we found that the SAM synthesis is the rate-limiting step (Scheme 1B and Table S1, ESI\u2020). Hence, fast in situ SAM synthesis will be the key to improving the overall trans-halogenation efficiency. The first SAM-dependent chlorinase SalL was reported to prefer the conversion of 50-ClDA to SAM in vitro.8 Here, our newly discovered SAM-dependent chlorinases, ClA1 and ClA2, showed that they are significantly more efficient in SAM synthesis from 50-ClDA than the fluorinase FlA4. Based on this, we developed a coupled chlorinase\u2013fluorinase system for efficient trans-halogenation of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA. The chlorinase was for the first time found to exhibit substrate tolerance at the C-2 position of the substrate and to work together with the fluorinase, enabling improved trans-halogenation of 50-ClDEA to 50-FDEA. ClA1 (WP_078486934) was identified via BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) server. It shares 59.6% amino acid identity with SalL. Coding sequences (CDSs) for the ClA1 protein are present in the genomes of Streptomyces ahygroscopicus subsp. wuyiensis CK-1519 and four strains of Streptomyces albulus,20\u201323 all isolated from soil (Table S2, ESI\u2020). ClA2 (P077_11362) was identified via BLAST search of a collection of actinomycete genome sequences24,25 (PRJNA238534). It shares 52.7% amino acid identity with SalL. CDS for ClA2 is present in the genome of Umezawaea tangerina NRRL B-24463 isolated from soil. Multiple sequence alignments showed that ClA1, ClA2 and SalL do not have the 22-residue loop region, which can be found in all five known fluorinases (FlA 92-113) (Fig. S1, ESI\u2020). Unlike SalL discovered from a high-chloride marine source,8 the two new chlorinases were unveiled from soil bacteria. To find whether terrestrial bacteria could evolve more efficient chlorinases than SalL, kinetic studies of SalL, ClA1 and ClA2 were carried out for the chlorination reaction with varying concentrations of ClNone (Table S3 and Fig. S2, ESI\u2020). The relative catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) of ClA1 and ClA2 are quite similar to that of SalL. The affinity of ClA1 for ClNone is lower than that of SalL. These two new chlorinases may rely on subsequent steps in the biosynthetic pathway to pull the reaction forward. Prediction of secondary metabolite clusters by antiSMASH (antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell)26 showed that clA1 is within the putative biosynthetic gene cluster for g-butyrolactone (GBL) biosynthesis. GBLs are small signaling molecules (also known as autoregulators) that trigger antibiotic biosynthesis and morphological development in Streptomyces species at nanomolar concentrations.27 The gene encoding ClA1 is close to the genes coding for putative NAD(P)-dependent oxidor-eductase, g-butyrolactone biosynthesis enzyme and g-butyrolactone receptor protein (Fig. S3, ESI\u2020). Though 14 GBLs with a shared GBL core and varied fatty acid side chains are known,28 no halogenated GBL has ever been discovered. The conversion of 50-ClDA to SAM is more efficient than the conversion of SAM to 50-ClDA for both ClA1 and ClA2 (Table 1 and Fig. S4 and S5, ESI\u2020). The kcat/KM value also showed that the two chlorinases are significantly more efficient in SAM formation from 50-ClDA than the fluorinase FlA4 (Table 1). Thus, the rate-limiting step of fluorinase-mediated trans-halogenation can be accelerated by the chlorinases. This led us to couple the chlorinases, the robust SAM synthesis enzymes, to the fluorinase for improved overall trans-halogenation. The chlorinases were coupled to FlA4 for one-pot conversion of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA in the presence of L-Met or L-SeMet at 37 1C for 1 h (Table 2 and Fig. S6A, ESI\u2020). The trans-halogenation reactions with the chlorinases coupled to FlA4 were compared with the reactions without the chlorinases. In the presence of L-Met, the trans-halogenation reaction with 50 mM FlA4 alone produced 50-FDA in only 3.2% yield. Addition of 30 mM chlorinase improved the 50-FDA yield by up to 25.6 fold. However, addition of 30 mM FlA4 just increased the yield by 1.5 fold. Although a higher concentration of the fluorinase is often believed to increase the product yields, a cocktail of chlorinase and fluorinase achieved significantly higher yields than the fluorinase alone with the same total amount of enzyme. The trans-halogenation reactions were further improved in the presence of L-SeMet, leading to 490% 50-FDA yields obtained by the coupling of FlA4 and the chlorinase. Thus, the chlorinase\u2013fluorinase system is able to accelerate the enzymatic trans-halogenation of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA. To probe whether the chlorinase can tolerate the C-2 position of the adenine ring of the substrate 50-ClDA, we coupled the chlorinase to the fluorinase for the trans-halogenation of 50-ClDEA to 50-FDEA (Table 2 and Fig. S6B, ESI\u2020). The reactions were run under the same conditions for the trans-halogenation of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA. In the presence of L-Met, the trans-halogenation efficiencies decreased dramatically compared to the conversion of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA. L-SeMet10,11,13 was used instead of L-Met to improve the trans-halogenation efficiency on 50-ClDEA. In the presence of L-SeMet, the reaction with 50 mM FlA4 alone produced 50-FDEA in only 4.7% yield in 1 h. Addition of 30 mM FlA4 only increased the yield by 1.7 fold. Impressively, addition of 30 mM ClA2 led to the highest 50-FDEA yield (91.6%), with a 19.6-fold improvement. A compar-ison of the conversion of 50-ClDEA and L-SeMet to the SAM derivative by the three chlorinases showed that ClA2 exhibited the highest consumption rate of 50-ClDEA to produce the SAM derivative (Fig. S7, ESI\u2020). Thus, the chlorinase is able to tolerate the linear acetylene moiety at the C-2 position of the adenine ring and work together with the fluorinase for highly efficient trans-halogenation of 50-ClDEA to 50-FDEA. In conclusion, we discovered two new SAM-dependent chlor-inases from soil bacteria and developed a coupled chlorinase\u2013 fluorinase system for highly improved trans-halogenation reactions.

        "five reported ones (Scheme 1A). Comparing the two separate reaction steps, we found that the SAM synthesis is the rate-limiting step (Scheme 1B and Table S1, ESI\u2020). Hence, fast in situ SAM synthesis will be the key to improving the overall trans-halogenation efficiency. The first SAM-dependent chlorinase SalL was reported to prefer the conversion of 50-ClDA to SAM in vitro.8 Here, our newly discovered SAM-dependent chlorinases, ClA1 and ClA2, showed that they are significantly more efficient in SAM synthesis from 50-ClDA than the fluorinase FlA4. Based on this, we developed a coupled chlorinase\u2013fluorinase system for efficient trans-halogenation of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA. The chlorinase was for the first time found to exhibit substrate tolerance at the C-2 position of the substrate and to work together with the fluorinase, enabling improved trans-halogenation of 50-ClDEA to 50-FDEA.",
        "ClA1 (WP_078486934) was identified via BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) server. It shares 59.6% amino acid identity with SalL. Coding sequences (CDSs) for the ClA1 protein are present in the genomes of Streptomyces ahygroscopicus subsp. wuyiensis CK-1519 and four strains of Streptomyces albulus,20\u201323 all isolated from soil (Table S2, ESI\u2020). ClA2 (P077_11362) was identified via BLAST search of a collection of actinomycete genome sequences24,25 (PRJNA238534). It shares 52.7% amino acid identity with SalL. CDS for ClA2 is present in the genome of Umezawaea tangerina NRRL B-24463 isolated from soil. Multiple sequence alignments showed that ClA1, ClA2 and SalL do not have the 22-residue loop region, which can be found in all five known fluorinases (FlA 92-113) (Fig. S1, ESI\u2020).",
        "Unlike SalL discovered from a high-chloride marine source,8 the two new chlorinases were unveiled from soil bacteria. To find whether terrestrial bacteria could evolve more efficient chlorinases than SalL, kinetic studies of SalL, ClA1 and ClA2 were carried out for the chlorination reaction with varying concentrations of ClNone (Table S3 and Fig. S2, ESI\u2020). The relative catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) of ClA1 and ClA2 are quite similar to that of SalL. The affinity of ClA1 for ClNone is lower than that of SalL. These two new chlorinases may rely on subsequent steps in the biosynthetic pathway to pull the reaction forward.",
        "Prediction of secondary metabolite clusters by antiSMASH (antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell)26 showed that clA1 is within the putative biosynthetic gene cluster for g-butyrolactone (GBL) biosynthesis. GBLs are small signaling molecules (also known as autoregulators) that trigger antibiotic biosynthesis and morphological development in Streptomyces species at nanomolar concentrations.27 The gene encoding ClA1 is close to the genes coding for putative NAD(P)-dependent oxidor-eductase, g-butyrolactone biosynthesis enzyme and g-butyrolactone receptor protein (Fig. S3, ESI\u2020). Though 14 GBLs with a shared GBL core and varied fatty acid side chains are known,28 no halogenated GBL has ever been discovered.",
        "The conversion of 50-ClDA to SAM is more efficient than the conversion of SAM to 50-ClDA for both ClA1 and ClA2 (Table 1 and Fig. S4 and S5, ESI\u2020). The kcat/KM value also showed that the two chlorinases are significantly more efficient in SAM formation from 50-ClDA than the fluorinase FlA4 (Table 1). Thus, the rate-limiting step of fluorinase-mediated trans-halogenation can be accelerated by",
        "the chlorinases. This led us to couple the chlorinases, the robust SAM synthesis enzymes, to the fluorinase for improved overall trans-halogenation. The chlorinases were coupled to FlA4 for one-pot conversion of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA in the presence of L-Met or L-SeMet at 37 1C for 1 h (Table 2 and Fig. S6A, ESI\u2020). The trans-halogenation reactions with the chlorinases coupled to FlA4 were compared with the reactions without the chlorinases. In the presence of L-Met, the trans-halogenation reaction with 50 mM FlA4 alone produced 50-FDA in only 3.2% yield. Addition of 30 mM chlorinase improved the 50-FDA yield by up to 25.6 fold. However, addition of 30 mM FlA4 just increased the yield by 1.5 fold. Although a higher concentration of the fluorinase is often believed to increase the product yields, a cocktail of chlorinase and fluorinase achieved significantly higher yields than the fluorinase alone with the same total amount of enzyme. The trans-halogenation reactions were further improved in the presence of L-SeMet, leading to 490% 50-FDA yields obtained by the coupling of FlA4 and the chlorinase. Thus, the chlorinase\u2013fluorinase system is able to accelerate the enzymatic trans-halogenation of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA. To probe whether the chlorinase can tolerate the C-2 position of the adenine ring of the substrate 50-ClDA, we coupled the chlorinase to the fluorinase for the trans-halogenation of 50-ClDEA to 50-FDEA (Table 2 and Fig. S6B, ESI\u2020). The reactions were run under the same conditions for the trans-halogenation of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA. In the presence of L-Met, the trans-halogenation efficiencies decreased dramatically compared to the conversion of 50-ClDA to 50-FDA. L-SeMet10,11,13 was used instead of L-Met to improve the trans-halogenation efficiency on 50-ClDEA. In the presence of L-SeMet, the reaction with 50 mM FlA4 alone produced 50-FDEA in only 4.7% yield in 1 h. Addition of 30 mM FlA4 only increased the yield by 1.7 fold. Impressively, addition of 30 mM ClA2 led to the highest 50-FDEA yield (91.6%), with a 19.6-fold improvement. A compar-ison of the conversion of 50-ClDEA and L-SeMet to the SAM derivative by the three chlorinases showed that ClA2 exhibited the highest consumption rate of 50-ClDEA to produce the SAM derivative (Fig. S7, ESI\u2020). Thus, the chlorinase is able to tolerate the linear acetylene moiety at the C-2 position of the adenine ring and work together with the fluorinase for highly efficient trans-halogenation of 50-ClDEA to 50-FDEA. In conclusion, we discovered two new SAM-dependent chlor-inases from soil bacteria and developed a coupled chlorinase\u2013 fluorinase system for highly improved trans-halogenation reactions.",
