To further investigate the 34 secondary metabolite repertoire of underexploited bacterial families, we chose to analyze a novel representative 35 of the yet untapped bacterial phylum Planctomycetes for the production of secondary metabolites under 36 laboratory culture conditions. Development of a planctomycetal high density cultivation technique in 37 combination with high resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed Planctomycetales strain 10988 to produce 38 the plant toxin 3,5 dibromo p-anisic acid. This molecule represents the first secondary metabolite reported from 39 any planctomycete. Genome mining revealed the biosynthetic origin of this doubly brominated secondary 40 metabolite and a biosynthesis model for the com-pound was devised. Comparison of the biosynthetic route to 41 biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for formation of polybrominated small aromatic compounds reveals 42 evidence for an evolutionary link, while the compound\u2019s herbicidal activity points towards an ambivalent role of 43 the metabolite in the planctomycetal ecosystem. 44 1 Introduction 45 Bacterial secondary metabolism has long been a source of chemically diverse and biologically active natural 46 products.1,2 In fact, large numbers of biologically active entities have been isolated from extensively screened 47 phyla such as actinobacteria, firmicutes and proteobacteria.3\u20135 To establish alternative sources, natural products 48 research is increasingly focusing on taxa that have been less exploited to date, but show potential for production 49 of secondary metabolites according to the presence of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in 50 their genomes.2 This strategic shift towards new producers increases chances for the discovery of novel bioactive 51 secondary metabolite scaffolds that are chemically distinct from the scaffolds found in previously screened 52 bacteria. While it has long been stated that phylogenetically distant species have a more distinct secondary 53 metabolism, recent comprehensive secondary metabolome studies were able to validate this claim.6,7 54 Accordingly, it is now widely recognized that there is an urgent need to scrutinize novel bacterial taxa, alongside 55 the use of sensitive mass spectrometry and varied cultivation conditions to unearth novel natural products from 56 bacterial secondary metabolomes.8 Planctomycetes represent an underexploited phylum of bacteria in terms of 57 their secondary metabolite potential.9 Although planctomycetes have been already discovered in 1924, until now 58 no secondary metabolite of planctomycetal origin has been reported.10 This bleak picture is in clear contrast to 59 previous in-silico genome analysis that suggested planctomycetes to contain a significant number of secondary 60 metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).9,11 In this work, we describe the first secondary metabolite from 61 any planctomycete including its structural characterization and biosynthesis, whereas its biological activity sheds 62 light on the putative ecological role within the planctomycete\u2019s natural habitat. 63 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under anot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Our efforts revealed a swarming, rose colored bacterial isolate 66 that was designated as strain 10988 (see Figure 1). 67 68 Figure 1. Growth characteristics of Planctomycetales strain 10988 on solid medium displaying swarming (I and III), fruiting 69  4  75 Figure 2. Phylogenetic tree inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity showing Planctomycetales strain 10988 among 76  5  This finding is well in line with planctomycetal growth in nature that occurs in parts fixed to the surfaces of 98 macroalgae.9 The slow growth of this isolate in combination with initially low secondary metabolite production 99 rates \u2013 as judged by LC-MS analysis -led us to devise a fermenter based cultivation to obtain increased secondary 100 metabolite yields that could not be achieved in shake flask cultivations. As a means to stimulate productivity of 101 the planctomycetal strain for secondary metabolite isolation, we added adsorber resin to shake flask cultures. 102 This should circumvent productivity limitations arising from feedback inhibition mechanisms.18 However, addition 103 of adsorber resin led to complete suppression of planctomycetal growth unless the culture was inoculated with a 104 high concentration of actively growing cells. When strain 10988 was grown in absence of adsorber resin, 105 inoculation of liquid cultures with a very low concentration of live cells was sufficient to stimulate planctomycetal 106 growth. The most probable explanation for this phenomenon is that the presence of adsorber resin in low density 107 cultures masks certain quorum sensing signals by binding them, inhibiting cooperative growth of planctomycetes. 108 While quorum sensing has been linked to different effects such as the inhibition of biofilm formation or virulence, 109 a quorum sensing signal that increases or stalls cell division speed has not been described yet.19  As a result, in 110 order to avoid lack of growth or unnecessarily lengthy lag phases in planctomycetal fermentations in larger scale 111 production cultures, adsorber resin addition was performed several days post inoculation of the respective 112 fermenter. In analytical scale shake flask cultivations, the effect of adding resin directly could be mitigated by 113 inoculation of the cultures with a higher concentration of live cells. 114 Discovery of 3,5-dibromo p-anisic acid To assess the secondary metabolome of planctomycetal strain 10988, methanolic extracts of the strain\u2019s 115 culture supplemented with adsorber resin were prepared and compared to methanolic extracts of the 116 corresponding medium (\u201cblank\u201d sample) to obtain an overview about its secondary metabolome. The bacterial 117 extract as well as the blank were subjected to high-resolution LC-MS analysis using a reverse-phase UPLC-118 coupled qTOF setup (supporting information). This analysis revealed an intriguing signal presenting a 119 monoisotopic mass of 308.873 Da [M+H]+ (C8H6Br2O3, \u0394 m/z = 6 ppm) and an isotope pattern that pointed 120 towards double bromination.20 Maximum cell density as well as the production rate of this doubly brominated 121 compound remained limiting for material supply in shake flask cultures even after media optimization 122 (supporting information). We therefore developed a method to grow strain 10988 in a fermenter which allowed 123 to purify the candidate compound by semi-preparative HPLC (supporting information). 124 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under anot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

I) LC-MS chromatogram of Planctomycetales strain 10988 with magnification of the MS signal for 3,5 dibromo p-126  7  Biosynthesis of 3,5-dibromo p-anisic acid In order to identify the biosynthetic origin of 1, we determined the complete genome of Planctomycetales 141 strain 10988 using PacBio long read sequencing technology (supporting information). Genome assembly resulted 142 in a single circular bacterial chromosome of 6.6 Mbp with a total GC content of 50.4% (GenBank accession number 143 XXX). AntiSMASH analysis of the bacterial genome annotated 3 terpene biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), an 144 ectoine BGC, a cluster for lassopeptide biosynthesis and a PKS type III BGC.21 Contrary to earlier genome mining 145 results from planctomycetes, the genome of strain 10988 does not encode any multimodular secondary 146 metabolite pathways in its genome.11,22 Since our newly elucidated secondary metabolite is likely not produced 147 by a multimodular megasynthase, the biosynthesis gene cluster predictors run by antiSMASH are in this case 148 unsuitable to annotate the corresponding biosynthesis pathway, which possibly consists of a set of \u2018stand-alone\u2019 149 enzymes.21 We therefore searched the obtained genome for flavin dependent halogenase enzymes, as most 150 region selective bromination or chlorination reactions on aromatic systems are catalyzed by this protein family in 151 nature. 23,24 The flavoprotein showing highest homology to halogenating enzymes was named BaaB. It was found 152 encoded adjacent to -and putatively on the same mRNA strand as -a chorismate lyase-like protein termed BaaA. 153 This protein could plausibly deliver the precursor para-hydroxy benzoeic acid from the cellular chorismic acid pool 154 (Figure 4). 25 Homology modelling of the two proteins on the protein fold recognition server Phyre2 supports this 155 finding, as both proteins involved in biosynthesis of 1 are correctly mapped onto the expected protein families.26 156 Unfortunately, and despite serious efforts we were unable to develop methods to genetically manipulate the 157 planctomycetal strain and we were thus unable to further validate our hypothesis by an inactivation mutant of 158 the baaA and baaB locus. The mechanism of UbiC-like chorismate lyases such as BaaA is less studied in comparison 159 to the mechanism of chorismate mutases. Chorismate mutase reactions consist of an electrocyclic 6 electron 160 rearrangement reaction that leads to prephenate formation (Figure 4).25 Chorismate lyase enzymes like BaaA use 161 a closely related electrocyclic 6 electron rearrangement reaction that removes pyruvate from chorismate to form 162 p-hydroxy benzoeic acid.27 At this point we cannot differentiate whether p-hydroxybenzoeic acid is methylated 163 to p-anisic acid first or if methyl transfer occurs after double bromination of p-hydroxybezoeic acid by the 164 brominase enzyme BaaB. In order to finish biosynthesis of 1 after the action of BaaA and BaaB, an SAM dependent 165 O-methyl transferase (BaaC) is needed that transforms 2 into 1. When analyzing the genetic locus encoding BaaA 166 and BaaB we did not find such an enzyme, meaning BaaC is encoded in a different genetic locus. The fact that the 167 baaA and baaB genes are encoded adjacently in the genome, while the corresponding methyl transferase baaC 168 is encoded in a different location may indicate that dibromo p-hydroxybenzoeic acid is produced fist and 169 subsequently methylated. It is worth noting that we could not identify either of the possible intermediates via LC-170 MS from the 10988 strain extracts. As BaaB is the only halogenase enzyme encoded in the baa BGC, it is certainly 171 responsible for 3,5 dibromination of the aromatic moiety. As both positions that are brominated are chemically 172 equivalent it is not surprising that both halogenations are performed by the same enzyme. Furthermore, we 173 observe strict specificity of BaaB for bromine as no chlorinated or mixed brominated and chlorinated anisic acid 174 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under anot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Thus, BaaB is either unable to bind chloride anions instead 175 of bromide anions due to a difference in binding cavity size, or the redox potential of BaaB is not sufficient to 176 oxidize chloride anions but is sufficient to oxidize bromide ions to an activated species. Still, BaaB is not the only 177 such enzyme unable to process chlorine, as the brominase Bmp5 from Pseudoalteromonas strains involved in 178 biosynthesis of polybrominated phenols is also specific for bromine over chlorine.28 The architectures of the 179 responsible loci producing polybrominated biphenylic secondary metabolites show remarkable similarity to the 180 Baa operon even though the host organisms are phylogenetically very distant. While Bmp5-like proteins from P. 181 luteoviolacea 2ta16 and P. phenolica O-BC30 are very similar as they share 96% homology, their similarity to BaaB 182 remains around 44%. This finding is readily explained as Pseudoalteromonads and Planctomycetes are 183 phylogenetically far apart and BaaB only catalyzes meta-position bromination, while Bmp5 also catalyzes ipso 184 substitution of CO2 at the aromatic core. This reaction removes the carboxylic acid and the phenols are not 185 methylated afterwards.29,30 Furthermore, in biosynthesis of polybrominated biphenyl ethers in 186 Pseudoalteromonads, an additional enzyme called Bmp7 uses phenolic coupling reactions to form biphenyl 187 structures that do not exist in our planctomyces strain, as the baa gene cluster in strain 10988 does not possess 188 the corresponding CYP P450 enzymes. 30 The absence of CYP enzymes in the planctomycetal BGC explains why 189 the planctomycete only synthesizes monocyclic polybrominated aromatic compounds, as it lacks the CYP enzyme 190 required to perform phenol couplings leading to the formation of biphenylic compounds.30,31 191 192 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under anot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A) Gene cluster for 3,5 dibromo p-anisic acid (1) biosynthesis B) Proposed model for biosynthesis of 1 including the 194  10  Bioactivity evaluation of 1 and its analogs Due to the double bromination of 1, its biosynthesis is costly to the strain in terms of energy and resources. 210 Therefore, 1 can be plausibly expected to confer a competitive advantage to strain 10988 in its environment. To 211 evaluate this biological role of 1 we set out to profile its bioactivity as well as the bioactivity of its biological 212 precursor 2 and its isomer Methyl 3,5 p-hydroxy benzoeic acid (3). The compounds 2 and 3 that cannot be 213 obtained from the planctomycetal culture broth are commercially available. 214 215 Scheme 1. The natural product 3,5 dibromo p-anisic acid (1), its putative biological precursor 3,5 dibromo p-hydroxybenzoeic 216  11  On the potential biological role of 1 Many planctomycetes live in close association with macroalgae which they cover almost completely.34 Given 238 that the strain 10988 was isolated from a marine sediment, the strain is likely associated with marine algae in its 239 natural habitat. The exact mode of interaction between the planctomycetes and the macroalgae has yet to be 240 determined. Still, the high abundance of planctomycetes on algal species, which can reach up to 50 % of the algal 241 microbiome, indicates that these bacteria are significant interaction partners for the algae.34 One hypothesis 242 considers the algae as a food source for planctomycetes, since they are able to utilize uncommon sugars such as 243 rhamnose and fucose contained in algal biomass. In our case, strain 10988 \u2013 like other planctomycetes \u2013 was able 244 to grow on uncommon sugars such as galactose, mannose, lactose, sucrose, maltose raffinose, xylose and 245 rhamnose (supporting information, Figure S2), indicating that this nutritional option could apply to strain 10988. 246 11 As on the other hand, the planctomyces bacterium possesses the ability to produce the plant toxin 3,5 dibromo 247 p-anisic acid, whose production seems to be tightly controlled as judged by the low production titers under 248 laboratory conditions, we reason that an ambivalent interaction model might take place between planctomycetes 249 and their plant hosts. The planctomycetes strains probably live on the algal surface and modulate the local 250 microbial community until they sense the algal species they live on is weakening. This might trigger expression of 251 said plant toxin to kill and decay this part of the algae and the bacterium would subsequently move on to colonize 252 different algae. Similar \u2018Jeckyll and Hyde\u2019 behavior, meaning the ability to switch between commensalism and 253 symbiosis, comparable to planctomycetal colonization of algae, and a virulent state that is hostile to its host 254 organism has been described for the human pathogen C. albicans.35 The ability of strain 10988 to produce a plant 255 toxin as a bacterium associated to macroscopic plants can be seen as a strong hint that the bacterium adopts such 256 a strategy. 257 3 Conclusion  258 In this work we describe the cultivation of a new marine planctomycete that is genetically distant from all 259 planctomycetes known to date, and reveal Planctomycetales strain 10988 as producer of a dibrominated 260 secondary metabolite. Isolation of this secondary metabolite required a stirred tank reactor setting and optimized 261 medium and culture conditions. Subsequent structure elucidation of 1 by NMR revealed an intriguing structure 262 and thus sparked interest in the biosynthetic origin and ecological role of the compound. We were able to pinpoint 263 the core biosynthesis genes baaA and baaB that can accomplish the core structure of 1. Investigation of the 264 bioactivity of 1 as well as the bioactivity of its isomer 3 and putative precursor 2 showed that this compound class 265 displays herbicidal activity in A. stolonifera penncross germination assays, leading us to hypothesize on a biological 266 role of this compound in the life cycle of the algal symbiont Planctomycetales strain 10988. In conclusion, we 267 contribute to the understanding of the biogenesis of small polyhalogenated compounds in marine bacteria, 268 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under anot certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Thus, the overall potential of planctomycetes awaits further investigation. While 279 growing these bacteria under laboratory conditions may be tedious and non-trivial, devising methods for their 280 cultivation is a valuable tool to tap into the planctomycetal secondary metabolite space. The discovery of 281 polybrominated compounds in strain 10988 is well in line with both the observation that this bacterium is an 282 obligate halophile and reminiscent of the strain\u2019s marine origin. The isolated and characterized natural product 283 3,5 dibromo p-anisic acid shows that Nature, especially the marine microbial community is able to biosynthesize 284 polyhalogenated small aromatic compounds that look like anthropogenic products of chemical synthesis. 285 286 Acknowledgement 287 The authors would like to thank Anja Paluczak and Viktoria Schmitt for the herbicidal and antimicrobial assays 288 with 3,5 dibromo p-anisic acid and its analogs.

        "The roles of the majority of bacterial secondary metabolites, especially those from uncommon sources are 33",
        "yet elusive even though many of these compounds show striking biological activities. To further investigate the 34 secondary metabolite repertoire of underexploited bacterial families, we chose to analyze a novel representative 35 of the yet untapped bacterial phylum Planctomycetes for the production of secondary metabolites under 36 laboratory culture conditions. Development of a planctomycetal high density cultivation technique in 37 combination with high resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed Planctomycetales strain 10988 to produce 38 the plant toxin 3,5 dibromo p-anisic acid. This molecule represents the first secondary metabolite reported from 39 any planctomycete. Genome mining revealed the biosynthetic origin of this doubly brominated secondary 40 metabolite and a biosynthesis model for the com-pound was devised. Comparison of the biosynthetic route to 41 biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for formation of polybrominated small aromatic compounds reveals 42 evidence for an evolutionary link, while the compound\u2019s herbicidal activity points towards an ambivalent role of 43 the metabolite in the planctomycetal ecosystem. 44",

        "products.1,2 In fact, large numbers of biologically active entities have been isolated from extensively screened 47 phyla such as actinobacteria, firmicutes and proteobacteria.3\u20135 To establish alternative sources, natural products 48 research is increasingly focusing on taxa that have been less exploited to date, but show potential for production 49 of secondary metabolites according to the presence of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in 50 their genomes.2 This strategic shift towards new producers increases chances for the discovery of novel bioactive 51 secondary metabolite scaffolds that are chemically distinct from the scaffolds found in previously screened 52 bacteria. While it has long been stated that phylogenetically distant species have a more distinct secondary 53 metabolism, recent comprehensive secondary metabolome studies were able to validate this claim.6,7 54 Accordingly, it is now widely recognized that there is an urgent need to scrutinize novel bacterial taxa, alongside 55 the use of sensitive mass spectrometry and varied cultivation conditions to unearth novel natural products from 56 bacterial secondary metabolomes.8 Planctomycetes represent an underexploited phylum of bacteria in terms of 57 their secondary metabolite potential.9 Although planctomycetes have been already discovered in 1924, until now 58 no secondary metabolite of planctomycetal origin has been reported.10 This bleak picture is in clear contrast to 59 previous in-silico genome analysis that suggested planctomycetes to contain a significant number of secondary 60 metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).9,11 In this work, we describe the first secondary metabolite from 61 any planctomycete including its structural characterization and biosynthesis, whereas its biological activity sheds 62 light on the putative ecological role within the planctomycete\u2019s natural habitat. 63",

        "This finding is well in line with planctomycetal growth in nature that occurs in parts fixed to the surfaces of 98 macroalgae.9 The slow growth of this isolate in combination with initially low secondary metabolite production 99 rates \u2013 as judged by LC-MS analysis -led us to devise a fermenter based cultivation to obtain increased secondary 100 metabolite yields that could not be achieved in shake flask cultivations. As a means to stimulate productivity of 101 the planctomycetal strain for secondary metabolite isolation, we added adsorber resin to shake flask cultures. 102 This should circumvent productivity limitations arising from feedback inhibition mechanisms.18 However, addition 103 of adsorber resin led to complete suppression of planctomycetal growth unless the culture was inoculated with a 104 high concentration of actively growing cells. When strain 10988 was grown in absence of adsorber resin, 105 inoculation of liquid cultures with a very low concentration of live cells was sufficient to stimulate planctomycetal 106 growth. The most probable explanation for this phenomenon is that the presence of adsorber resin in low density 107 cultures masks certain quorum sensing signals by binding them, inhibiting cooperative growth of planctomycetes. 108 While quorum sensing has been linked to different effects such as the inhibition of biofilm formation or virulence, 109 a quorum sensing signal that increases or stalls cell division speed has not been described yet.19  As a result, in 110 order to avoid lack of growth or unnecessarily lengthy lag phases in planctomycetal fermentations in larger scale 111 production cultures, adsorber resin addition was performed several days post inoculation of the respective 112 fermenter. In analytical scale shake flask cultivations, the effect of adding resin directly could be mitigated by 113 inoculation of the cultures with a higher concentration of live cells. 114",

This analysis revealed an intriguing signal presenting a 119 monoisotopic mass of 308.873 Da [M+H]+ (C8H6Br2O3, \u0394 m/z = 6 ppm) and an isotope pattern that pointed 120 towards double bromination.20 Maximum cell density as well as the production rate of this doubly brominated 121 compound remained limiting for material supply in shake flask cultures even after media optimization 122 (supporting information).

        "strain 10988 using PacBio long read sequencing technology (supporting information). Genome assembly resulted 142 in a single circular bacterial chromosome of 6.6 Mbp with a total GC content of 50.4% (GenBank accession number 143 XXX). AntiSMASH analysis of the bacterial genome annotated 3 terpene biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), an 144 ectoine BGC, a cluster for lassopeptide biosynthesis and a PKS type III BGC.21 Contrary to earlier genome mining 145 results from planctomycetes, the genome of strain 10988 does not encode any multimodular secondary 146 metabolite pathways in its genome.11,22 Since our newly elucidated secondary metabolite is likely not produced 147 by a multimodular megasynthase, the biosynthesis gene cluster predictors run by antiSMASH are in this case 148 unsuitable to annotate the corresponding biosynthesis pathway, which possibly consists of a set of \u2018stand-alone\u2019 149 enzymes.21 We therefore searched the obtained genome for flavin dependent halogenase enzymes, as most 150 region selective bromination or chlorination reactions on aromatic systems are catalyzed by this protein family in 151 nature. 23,24 The flavoprotein showing highest homology to halogenating enzymes was named BaaB. It was found 152 encoded adjacent to -and putatively on the same mRNA strand as -a chorismate lyase-like protein termed BaaA. 153 This protein could plausibly deliver the precursor para-hydroxy benzoeic acid from the cellular chorismic acid pool 154 (Figure 4). 25 Homology modelling of the two proteins on the protein fold recognition server Phyre2 supports this 155 finding, as both proteins involved in biosynthesis of 1 are correctly mapped onto the expected protein families.26 156 Unfortunately, and despite serious efforts we were unable to develop methods to genetically manipulate the 157 planctomycetal strain and we were thus unable to further validate our hypothesis by an inactivation mutant of 158 the baaA and baaB locus. The mechanism of UbiC-like chorismate lyases such as BaaA is less studied in comparison 159 to the mechanism of chorismate mutases. Chorismate mutase reactions consist of an electrocyclic 6 electron 160 rearrangement reaction that leads to prephenate formation (Figure 4).25 Chorismate lyase enzymes like BaaA use 161 a closely related electrocyclic 6 electron rearrangement reaction that removes pyruvate from chorismate to form 162 p-hydroxy benzoeic acid.27 At this point we cannot differentiate whether p-hydroxybenzoeic acid is methylated 163 to p-anisic acid first or if methyl transfer occurs after double bromination of p-hydroxybezoeic acid by the 164 brominase enzyme BaaB. In order to finish biosynthesis of 1 after the action of BaaA and BaaB, an SAM dependent 165 O-methyl transferase (BaaC) is needed that transforms 2 into 1. When analyzing the genetic locus encoding BaaA 166 and BaaB we did not find such an enzyme, meaning BaaC is encoded in a different genetic locus. The fact that the 167 baaA and baaB genes are encoded adjacently in the genome, while the corresponding methyl transferase baaC 168 is encoded in a different location may indicate that dibromo p-hydroxybenzoeic acid is produced fist and 169 subsequently methylated. It is worth noting that we could not identify either of the possible intermediates via LC-170 MS from the 10988 strain extracts. As BaaB is the only halogenase enzyme encoded in the baa BGC, it is certainly 171 responsible for 3,5 dibromination of the aromatic moiety. As both positions that are brominated are chemically 172 equivalent it is not surprising that both halogenations are performed by the same enzyme. Furthermore, we 173 observe strict specificity of BaaB for bromine as no chlorinated or mixed brominated and chlorinated anisic acid 174",

        "derivatives can be identified in the fermentation broth. Thus, BaaB is either unable to bind chloride anions instead 175 of bromide anions due to a difference in binding cavity size, or the redox potential of BaaB is not sufficient to 176 oxidize chloride anions but is sufficient to oxidize bromide ions to an activated species. Still, BaaB is not the only 177 such enzyme unable to process chlorine, as the brominase Bmp5 from Pseudoalteromonas strains involved in 178 biosynthesis of polybrominated phenols is also specific for bromine over chlorine.28 The architectures of the 179 responsible loci producing polybrominated biphenylic secondary metabolites show remarkable similarity to the 180 Baa operon even though the host organisms are phylogenetically very distant. While Bmp5-like proteins from P. 181 luteoviolacea 2ta16 and P. phenolica O-BC30 are very similar as they share 96% homology, their similarity to BaaB 182 remains around 44%. This finding is readily explained as Pseudoalteromonads and Planctomycetes are 183 phylogenetically far apart and BaaB only catalyzes meta-position bromination, while Bmp5 also catalyzes ipso 184 substitution of CO2 at the aromatic core. This reaction removes the carboxylic acid and the phenols are not 185 methylated afterwards.29,30 Furthermore, in biosynthesis of polybrominated biphenyl ethers in 186 Pseudoalteromonads, an additional enzyme called Bmp7 uses phenolic coupling reactions to form biphenyl 187 structures that do not exist in our planctomyces strain, as the baa gene cluster in strain 10988 does not possess 188 the corresponding CYP P450 enzymes. 30 The absence of CYP enzymes in the planctomycetal BGC explains why 189 the planctomycete only synthesizes monocyclic polybrominated aromatic compounds, as it lacks the CYP enzyme 190 required to perform phenol couplings leading to the formation of biphenylic compounds.30,31 191",

        "Many planctomycetes live in close association with macroalgae which they cover almost completely.34 Given 238",
        "that the strain 10988 was isolated from a marine sediment, the strain is likely associated with marine algae in its 239 natural habitat. The exact mode of interaction between the planctomycetes and the macroalgae has yet to be 240 determined. Still, the high abundance of planctomycetes on algal species, which can reach up to 50 % of the algal 241 microbiome, indicates that these bacteria are significant interaction partners for the algae.34 One hypothesis 242 considers the algae as a food source for planctomycetes, since they are able to utilize uncommon sugars such as 243 rhamnose and fucose contained in algal biomass. In our case, strain 10988 \u2013 like other planctomycetes \u2013 was able 244 to grow on uncommon sugars such as galactose, mannose, lactose, sucrose, maltose raffinose, xylose and 245 rhamnose (supporting information, Figure S2), indicating that this nutritional option could apply to strain 10988. 246 11 As on the other hand, the planctomyces bacterium possesses the ability to produce the plant toxin 3,5 dibromo 247",
        "p-anisic acid, whose production seems to be tightly controlled as judged by the low production titers under 248 laboratory conditions, we reason that an ambivalent interaction model might take place between planctomycetes 249 and their plant hosts. The planctomycetes strains probably live on the algal surface and modulate the local 250 microbial community until they sense the algal species they live on is weakening. This might trigger expression of 251 said plant toxin to kill and decay this part of the algae and the bacterium would subsequently move on to colonize 252 different algae. Similar \u2018Jeckyll and Hyde\u2019 behavior, meaning the ability to switch between commensalism and 253 symbiosis, comparable to planctomycetal colonization of algae, and a virulent state that is hostile to its host 254 organism has been described for the human pathogen C. albicans.35 The ability of strain 10988 to produce a plant 255 toxin as a bacterium associated to macroscopic plants can be seen as a strong hint that the bacterium adopts such 256 a strategy. 257",

Subsequent structure elucidation of 1 by NMR revealed an intriguing structure 262 and thus sparked interest in the biosynthetic origin and ecological role of the compound. We were able to pinpoint 263 the core biosynthesis genes baaA and baaB that can accomplish the core structure of 1. Investigation of the 264 bioactivity of 1 as well as the bioactivity of its isomer 3 and putative precursor 2 showed that this compound class 265 displays herbicidal activity in A. stolonifera penncross germination assays, leading us to hypothesize on a biological 266 role of this compound in the life cycle of the algal symbiont Planctomycetales strain 10988.

        "whereas it remains astonishing to what extent such polybrominated aromatic substances are apparently released 269 into the ecosystem from biological instead of anthropogenic sources. 270",
        "This study also identifies planctomycetes as an underexploited source of biologically active secondary 271 metabolites, as 1 to the best of our knowledge is the first natural product described from this bacterial taxon. 272 However, we would like to point out that previous studies may have overestimated the genome encoded 273 secondary metabolite diversity of planctomycetes as a group, since strain 10988 under study here did not show 274 the presence of any multimodular megasynthetase.11,22 Even though strain 10988 shows some BGCs, especially 275 BGCs linked to terpene biosynthesis, megasynthase containing BGCs are often considered as benchmark indicators 276 for secondary metabolite production capability.2 On the other hand, the example presented here shows how 277 important it is to evaluate new taxa on the metabolomics stage, since metabolites of the type described here are 278 easily missed by genome mining. Thus, the overall potential of planctomycetes awaits further investigation. While 279 growing these bacteria under laboratory conditions may be tedious and non-trivial, devising methods for their 280 cultivation is a valuable tool to tap into the planctomycetal secondary metabolite space. The discovery of 281 polybrominated compounds in strain 10988 is well in line with both the observation that this bacterium is an 282 obligate halophile and reminiscent of the strain\u2019s marine origin. The isolated and characterized natural product 283 3,5 dibromo p-anisic acid shows that Nature, especially the marine microbial community is able to biosynthesize 284 polyhalogenated small aromatic compounds that look like anthropogenic products of chemical synthesis. 285",
