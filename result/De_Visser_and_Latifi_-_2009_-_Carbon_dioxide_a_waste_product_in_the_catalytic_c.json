Box 11155-3615, Tehran, Iran ReceiVed: NoVember 5, 2008 We present the first density functional theory study on R-ketoglutarate dependent halogenases and focus on the mechanism starting from the iron(IV)-oxo species. The studies show that the high-valent iron(IV)-oxo species reacts with substrates via an initial and rate determining hydrogen abstraction that is characterized by a large kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 26.7 leading to a radical intermediate. This KIE value is in good agreement with experimental data. The reaction proceeds via two-state reactivity patterns on competing quintet and septet spin state surfaces with close lying hydrogen abstraction barriers. However, the septet spin radical intermediate gives very high barriers for hydroxylation and chlorination whereas the barriers on the quintet spin state surface are much lower. The calculations give extra information regarding the nature of the intermediates and a prediction of a new low-energy mechanism starting from the radical intermediate, whereby a waste product from an earlier step in the catalytic cycle (CO2) is recycled and takes the hydroxyl radical away to form bicarbonate via an OH trapping mechanism. As a consequence, this mechanism prevents the occurrence of hydroxylated byproduct and gives a rationale for the sole observance of halogenated products. By contrast, a direct halogenation reaction cannot compete with hydroxylation due to higher reaction barriers. Our findings support experimental work in the field and give a rationale for the lack of hydroxylation products in R-ketoglutarate dependent halogenases. Many biological systems utilize molecular oxygen on an iron center for, for example, substrate monoxygenation, dioxygen-ation, as well as halogenation.1 The R-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases are a broad range of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of collagen in mammals, DNA and RNA base repair, and the biosynthesis of antibiotics in microbes.1,2 These enzymes typically contain a mononuclear nonheme iron center that is bound to two histidine and one aspartic acid residue via a 2His/1Asp structural motif.1,2 Spectroscopic studies character-ized the active species as an iron(IV)-oxo oxidant that reacts with substrates with a large kinetic isotope effect.3,4 A closely related group of enzymes are the R-ketoglutarate dependent halogenases (RKDH) that are involved in the production of halogenated compounds, as appear, for example, in the biosyn-thesis of vancomycin and chlortetracycline.5 The RKDH have a similar active site structure to the R-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases, such as taurine/R-ketoglutarate dioxygenase (TauD), but contain a 2His/1L (L ) halogen) motif. Neverthe-less, the catalytic cycle of RKDH closely resembles that of the TauD, whereby R-ketoglutarate, substrate, and molecular oxygen bind to an iron center. Subsequently, one oxygen atom of O2 is donated to R-ketoglutarate to form succinate, CO2 and a high-valent iron(IV)-oxo complex (Scheme 1). It has been proposed that after the hydrogen abstraction the halide is abstracted by the substrate rest-group to give halogenated products, but this hypothesis was disputed by recent density functional theory (DFT) studies on a biomimetic model complex that showed a preference of regioselective hydroxylation over chlorination.6 The question is therefore how these enzymes avoid generating hydroxylated byproduct. To resolve this tantalizing problem and to gain insight into how RKDH utilize molecular oxygen on an iron center to give chlorinated products, we set up a model of their active site and studied the competitive hydroxylation versus chlorination of a model substrate. The model of the active site of RKDH is based on that for TauD7 and contains an iron(IV)-oxo group linked to two imidazole groups (mimicking the two histidine ligands), a * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

SCHEME 1: Catalytic Cycle of r-Ketoglutarate chloride anion, R-ketopropionate (for R-ketoglutarate), carbon dioxide, and substrate (propene). All calculations were per-formed using the UB3LYP hybrid density functional method as implemented in Jaguar 7.0.8 We used a double-None quality LACVP basis set on iron that contains a core potential and 6-31G on the rest of the atoms (basis set B1) for optimizations and frequencies.9 Subsequent, single point calculations with a triple-None quality LACV3P+ basis set on iron in combination with 6-311+G* on the rest of the atoms confirmed the energetics. The effect of the environment on the ordering and relative energies of the reaction barriers was tested with the addition of a dielectric constant of magnitude \u03b5 ) 5.7 or 33.62 in Jaguar. Recent studies on a series of hydrogen abstraction reactions of substrates by the iron(IV)-oxo active species of cytochrome P450 enzymes showed that relative barrier heights can be calculated using these methods with a standard deviation of about 1-2 kcal mol-1.10 Therefore, relative barrier heights of about 2 kcal mol-1 should distinguish between different reaction mechanisms accurately. Figure 1 shows the potential energy landscape of competitive chlorination and hydroxylation of propene by our RKDH model as calculated with DFT. The reactant species is an iron(IV)-oxo (labeled 5Re) with a quintet spin ground-state that is well separated from the septet, triplet and singlet spin states in \u03b5 ) 5.7 (by 2.5, 9.1, and 18.1 kcal mol-1, respectively); the spin state ordering is similar to that obtained for TauD models.7 The reaction starts with a hydrogen atom abstraction from the substrate via a barrier TSHA to form a radical intermediate (RI). The barriers on the septet and quintet spin state surfaces are close in energy, but the septet spin state surface encounters high barriers for the subsequent steps in the reaction mechanism (Supporting Information), therefore, products are only formed on the quintet spin state surface. The rate determining step in the reaction mechanism is via 5,7TSHA and substitution of the hydrogen atoms of the substrate by deuterium atoms gives a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 26.7 with tunneling corrections included, in excellent agreement with experimentally determined KIE values.4 The barrier 5TSHA is 8.0 kcal mol-1 in a dielectric constant of \u03b5 ) 5.7, which is slightly higher in energy than that calculated for TauD using a similar model and the same methods.7 Therefore, the substitution of a carboxylic acid group of an aspartate residue by a chloride anion induces a destabiliz-ing effect on the hydrogen abstraction reaction and raises it by a couple of kcal mol-1. The radical intermediate (5RI) can transfer the chloride atom to the allyl radical via a barrier 5TSCl to form the chlorinated product (5PCl) or rebind the hydroxyl group via a barrier 5TSOH to form hydroxylated products (5POH). Thus, similarly to the studies of Noack and Siegbahn on a different biomimetic system, the direct chlorination reaction is higher in energy than the hydroxylation reaction so that dominant hydroxylation products would be expected, which is in disagreement with experiment. An alternative mechanism is shown in blue in Figure 1, whereby carbon dioxide byproduct from an earlier step in the catalytic cycle attacks the hydroxyl group in 5RI to form a bicarbonate complex (5B) via a barrier 5TSbi. A subsequent chlorination reaction via 5TSreb gives chlorinated products (5P\u2032Cl). As follows from Figure 1, this is a low-energy alternative that leads to chlorinated products by shuttling the hydroxyl group away from the reaction center and thereby preventing the formation of hydroxylated products. This is an essential reaction in RKDH enzymes because of the large exothermicity of the hydroxylation reaction. Although the OH trapping mechanism is entropically disfavored with respect to the hydroxylation reaction, even at the free energy scale it is the expected dominant reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, the formation of 5B from 5RI is thermoneutral at the free energy scale in a dielectric constant of \u03b5 ) 33.6. To ascertain that the OH trapping mechanism is unfeasible in hydroxylases, such as TauD, we calculated this mechanism for a TauD model (shown in the box in Figure 1). Thus, since Figure 1. Potential energy landscape of competitive hydroxylation and halogenation reactions of propene by the iron(IV)-oxo species (5Re) of the carboxylic acid group of Asp101 binds to the metal as a bidentate ligand in TauD, the metal in the hydroxo-iron complex (5RITauD) is hexa-coordinated, whereas it is pentacoordinated in the hydroxo-iron complex of RKHD (5RIRKHD). Thus, in the pentacoordinated system, the chloride and acetic acid groups bend away and make space for the incoming CO2 molecule thereby lowering the OH trapping barrier. By contrast, the repulsive interactions of CO2 with the anionic ligands in 5RITauD raise the OH trapping barrier and lead to dominant hydroxylated products. In summary, DFT calculations on the chlorination reaction of substrates by RKHD predict a novel mechanism whereby hydroxylated products are avoided. The reaction starts from the iron(IV)-oxo active species that abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate via a rate determining transition state and with an elevated KIE value in agreement with experimental studies. The hydroxo-iron complex reacts with CO2 products from an earlier step in the catalytic cycle that shuttles the hydroxo group away by forming bicarbonate and thereby preventing the occurrence of hydroxylated byproduct. This mechanism supports experi-mental studies in the field and gives a rationale for the lack of hydroxylated byproduct in the reaction mechanism of halogenases. Acknowledgment.
