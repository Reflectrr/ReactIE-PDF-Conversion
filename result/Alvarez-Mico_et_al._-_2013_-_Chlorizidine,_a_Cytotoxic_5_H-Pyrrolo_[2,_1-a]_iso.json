HughesCenter for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Scripps Institution of Oceanography,University of California\u2014San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0204Chambers C. Hughes: chughes@ucsd.eduAbstract Cultivation of an obligate marine Streptomyces strain has provided the cytotoxic natural productchlorizidine. X-Ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the metabolite is composed of achlorinated 2,3-dihydropyrrolizine ring attached to a chlorinated 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one.The carbon stereocenter in the dihydropyrrolizine is S-configured. Remarkably, the 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one moiety has no precedence in the field of natural products. Thepresence of this ring system, which was demonstrated to undergo facile nucleophilic substitutionreactions at the activated carbonyl group, is essential to the molecule\u2019s cytotoxicity againstHCT-116 human colon cancer cells.There are a substantial number of chemotherapeutic drugs on the market that are based onthe scaffolds of actinomycete-derived natural products.1 For instance, chemical studies ofterrestrial Streptomyces bacteria led to the discovery of actinomycin D,2a doxorubicin,2bbleomycin,2c carzinophilin,2d chromomycin A3,2e mithramycin,2f mitomycin C,2gsarkomycin,2h and streptozocin,2i and neocarzinostatin.2f No truly novel actinomycete-derived natural product structure has led to the development of a drug in recent years,1which at least suggests that terrestrial actinomycetes are no longer a viable source for newlead compounds. Studies of marine actinomycete bacteria, however, continue to yieldunique chemical structures with anticancer activity.3 For example, salinosporamide A fromSalinispora tropica is poised to enter phase II clinical trials.4In an effort to identify new chemotypes for therapeutic development, Streptomyces sp. strainCNH-287 was cultivated in a seawater-based medium (20 \u00d7 1 L).5 Notably, the strainrequired seawater for growth. Amberlite resin (XAD-18) was added after the first day ofcultivation. The resin was filtered and extracted with acetone after seven days, and the crudematerial was then fractionated on silica gel.

A cytotoxic metabolite with a prominent UV/visprofile was isolated from this fraction using C18 reversed-phase HPLC.It proved difficult to obtain pure compound sufficient for full spectroscopic analysis. Duringconcentration from either organic or aqueous solutions, extensive degradation occurred.Much less decomposition was observed when solutions were kept cool and dried under astream of nitrogen. In addition, the metabolite could be stored in dilute solutions away fromlight and air.A nonzero optical rotation, [\u03b1]D -35 (c 0.50, CH3CN), indicated that the natural productwas optically active, and a strong IR stretch at 1721 cm-1 revealed the presence of acarbonyl group. Mass spectrometry data for the natural product [HRESI-FT-MS m/z (M+H)+ = 442.9511, 444.9481, 446.9452, 448.9422] showed a molecular ion cluster consistentwith molecular formulae that include Cl2Br or Cl4. With 13 degrees of unsaturation,however, only C18H10Cl4N2O3 agreed with proton and carbon NMR data.We initially attempted to solve the structure of the natural product using 1D and 2D NMR(COSY, HSQC, HMBC) experiments (Table 1). The numbering of the molecule is shown inFigure 1. Low-field signals at \u03b4H 6.55 (\u03b4C 101.9) and 6.42 (\u03b4C 108.2) were conspicuous, inaddition to two overlapping signals at \u03b4H 5.80 (\u03b4C 99.3 and \u03b4C 53.0). A spin systemincluding a proton at \u03b4H 5.80 and the remaining upfield methylene protons at \u03b4H 3.08, 2.90,2.84, and 2.54 was apparent in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum. Interestingly, the upfield protonsignals from \u03b4 2.54-3.08 exhibited complex splitting patterns due to the flexibility in themolecule (vide infra). The paucity of hydrogen atoms and the plethora of quaternary carbonatoms made complete structural elucidation by NMR problematic.The structure of chlorizidine A (1) was finally determined using X-ray crystallographictechniques (Figure 2). Slow evaporation of a concentrated solution of 1 in benzene providedX-ray quality crystals. A molecule of benzene was incorporated into the crystal lattice.6Additionally, the lone tertiary carbon stereocenter was assigned an S-configuration [Flackparameter -0.02(2)].Chlorizidine A (1) displays an unprecedented structure involving a nitrogen-containingcarbon skeleton. The discovery of a naturally-occurring 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-onering system has not been previously described in the literature. Various synthetic accounts ofthe heterocycle, however, are well documented.7 The pyrroloisoindolone is connected to adichlorinated 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine at C-7.8 In the solid state, the congested regionabout the sp2-sp3 bond between the two ring systems forces the molecule to adopt a twistedconformation. In solution, though, 1 does not appear to exhibit atropisomerism.9The phenolic substituents at C-6 and C-8 of chlorizidine A (1) could be readilyfunctionalized. Treatment of 1 with acetic anhydride/triethylamine gave 2, and methylationwith dimethyl sulfate provided 3 (Scheme 1). Acetate 2 was a stable chemical entity muchless prone to degradation than 1. Interestingly, like the natural product, its proton NMRspectrum showed evidence of slow C-7/C-10 bond rotation relative to the NMR time scale.The well-resolved proton signals at C-1, C-9, C-10, and C-13 in 1 were now \u201cdoubled\u201d in 2.The diacetate structure was confirmed using X-ray crystallography. The crystal wascomposed of two low-energy \u201ctwisted\u201d conformers (see Supporting Information).The semisynthesis of bulkier phenolic esters\u2014isobutyrate 4, pivalate 5, and benzoate 6\u2014was undertaken in an attempt to produce an atropiosmeric mixture, but this approach wasnot successful (see Scheme 1).6 Analysis of these derivatives was much more complex, asthe ester functionalities revealed their own conformational preferences. The proton NMRAlvarez-Mico et al.Page 2Org Lett. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 March 01.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript spectra showed the simultaneous presence of several confomers with distinct chemical shifts(see Supporting Information).A second metabolite that was prone to degradation, chlorizidine B (7), was isolated fromculture extracts of CNH-287 (Scheme 2). A stable diacetate adduct 8 was constructed usingacetic anhydride. An additional aromatic NMR signal corresponding to C-7 was noticeable.Presumably, pyrrole 7 arises from hydrolysis and decarboxylation of chlorizidine A (1). Thenotion that 7 is an artifact of the culturing process was substantiated by treating 1 with a pH10 buffer composed of K2B4O7, K2CO3, and KOH.10 Under these conditions, the C-7carboxylic acid was observed [LRESI-MS m/z (M\u2013H)-= 459, 461, 463].11 Notably, manyother compounds are formed from the degradation of chlorizidine (1) under basic conditions(see Supporting Information).The central electrophilic carbonyl group of the 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one moietyengages sulfur-, oxygen-, and amine-containing nucleophiles in a substitution reaction,whereby the electron-poor dichloropyrrole functions as leaving group (see Scheme 2).5gWhen subjected to N-acetylcysteamine and potassium carbonate, thioester 9 was produced.Likewise, treatment of 1 with benzylamine gave amide 10 and treatment with potassiumcarbonate in methanol afforded ester 11. Unlike 9 and 10, ester 11 was not suitably stablefor complete purification and analysis. Peracetylation of 9-11 furnished stable derivatives12-14. A more efficient method for the synthesis of 14 was accomplished by treatingdiacetate 2 with aqueous NaOH in CH3OH followed by acetylation. Certainly, the isolationof pure chlorizidine A (1) is hindered, in part, by the lability of the pyrroloisoindolonemoeity toward nucleophiles.Chlorizidine A (1) and acylated derivatives 2, 4, and 5 exhibit noteworthy activity in a coloncancer cytotoxicity bioassay (Table 2).12 Against the HCT-116 adenocarcinoma cell line,131 showed an IC50 of 3.2-4.9 \u03bcM. Compounds 2, 4, and 5 showed similar activity.Irreversible methylation of the phenolic functionality in 1, yielding 3, rendered thecompound completely inactive. Any of the series of derivatives lacking the keypyrroloisoindolone ring system (7-14) had no measurable activity, strongly suggesting thatthis moiety is a crucial part of the metabolite\u2019s pharmacophore.Chlorizidine A diacetate (2) was tested against the NCI\u2019s panel of 60 tumor cell lines.14 Itwas modestly selective in terms of its cytotoxicity (See Supporting Information). However,against SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-2 melanoma cancer cells, 2 showed a pronounced LC50 of3.6 \u03bcM and 11 \u03bcM, respectively. Against MDA-MB-231/ATCC breast cancer cells, anLC50 of 11 \u03bcM was also determined.Chlorizidine A (1) has obvious structural similarity to marinopyrrole A (15), a secondarymetabolite from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. CNQ-418 (Scheme 3).15 Biosyntheticprecursor 16 is derived from a mixed NRPS-PKS pathway, whereby proline is loaded onto apeptidyl carrier protein, oxidized, chlorinated by an FADH2-dependent halogenase, andsubsequently extended by the PKS machinery.16 Cyclization/aromatization providesmonodeoxypyoluteorin (17).17 1,3\u2019-Bipyrrole 15 is then formed via a novel atroposelectiveN,C-pyrrole coupling reaction.18 An alternative route using 16 that includes N-acylation andreduction could yield chlorizidine A (1). That 16, despite its simplicity, may be utilized tomake two diverse, complex structure types is remarkable.Derived from what appears to represent a new, obligate marine Streptomyces sp.,chlorizidine is the first example of a natural product containing a 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one ring. Studies are now in progress to examine the biosynthesis andmechanism of action of these novel metabolites.Alvarez-Mico et al.Page 3Org Lett.

With 13 degrees of unsaturation,however, only C18H10Cl4N2O3 agreed with proton and carbon NMR",
        "data.We initially attempted to solve the structure of the natural product using 1D and 2D NMR(COSY, HSQC, HMBC) experiments (Table 1). The numbering of the molecule is shown inFigure 1. Low-field signals at \u03b4H 6.55 (\u03b4C 101.9) and 6.42 (\u03b4C 108.2) were conspicuous, inaddition to two overlapping signals at \u03b4H 5.80 (\u03b4C 99.3 and \u03b4C 53.0). A spin systemincluding a proton at \u03b4H 5.80 and the remaining upfield methylene protons at \u03b4H 3.08, 2.90,2.84, and 2.54 was apparent in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum. Interestingly, the upfield protonsignals from \u03b4 2.54-3.08 exhibited complex splitting patterns due to the flexibility in themolecule (vide infra). The paucity of hydrogen atoms and the plethora of quaternary carbonatoms made complete structural elucidation by NMR",
        "problematic.The structure of chlorizidine A (1) was finally determined using X-ray crystallographictechniques (Figure 2). Slow evaporation of a concentrated solution of 1 in benzene providedX-ray quality crystals. A molecule of benzene was incorporated into the crystal lattice.6Additionally, the lone tertiary carbon stereocenter was assigned an S-configuration [Flackparameter",
        "-0.02(2)].Chlorizidine A (1) displays an unprecedented structure involving a nitrogen-containingcarbon skeleton. The discovery of a naturally-occurring 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-onering system has not been previously described in the literature. Various synthetic accounts ofthe heterocycle, however, are well documented.7 The pyrroloisoindolone is connected to adichlorinated 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine at C-7.8 In the solid state, the congested regionabout the sp2-sp3 bond between the two ring systems forces the molecule to adopt a twistedconformation. In solution, though, 1 does not appear to exhibit",
        "atropisomerism.9The phenolic substituents at C-6 and C-8 of chlorizidine A (1) could be readilyfunctionalized. Treatment of 1 with acetic anhydride/triethylamine gave 2, and methylationwith dimethyl sulfate provided 3 (Scheme 1). Acetate 2 was a stable chemical entity muchless prone to degradation than 1. Interestingly, like the natural product, its proton NMRspectrum showed evidence of slow C-7/C-10 bond rotation relative to the NMR time scale.The well-resolved proton signals at C-1, C-9, C-10, and C-13 in 1 were now \u201cdoubled\u201d in 2.The diacetate structure was confirmed using X-ray crystallography.

        "Information).A second metabolite that was prone to degradation, chlorizidine B (7), was isolated fromculture extracts of CNH-287 (Scheme 2). A stable diacetate adduct 8 was constructed usingacetic anhydride. An additional aromatic NMR signal corresponding to C-7 was noticeable.Presumably, pyrrole 7 arises from hydrolysis and decarboxylation of chlorizidine A (1). Thenotion that 7 is an artifact of the culturing process was substantiated by treating 1 with a pH10 buffer composed of K2B4O7, K2CO3, and KOH.10 Under these conditions, the C-7carboxylic acid was observed [LRESI-MS m/z (M\u2013H)-= 459, 461, 463].11 Notably, manyother compounds are formed from the degradation of chlorizidine (1) under basic conditions(see Supporting",
        "Information).The central electrophilic carbonyl group of the 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one moietyengages sulfur-, oxygen-, and amine-containing nucleophiles in a substitution reaction,whereby the electron-poor dichloropyrrole functions as leaving group (see Scheme 2).5gWhen subjected to N-acetylcysteamine and potassium carbonate, thioester 9 was produced.Likewise, treatment of 1 with benzylamine gave amide 10 and treatment with potassiumcarbonate in methanol afforded ester 11. Unlike 9 and 10, ester 11 was not suitably stablefor complete purification and analysis. Peracetylation of 9-11 furnished stable derivatives12-14. A more efficient method for the synthesis of 14 was accomplished by treatingdiacetate 2 with aqueous NaOH in CH3OH followed by acetylation. Certainly, the isolationof pure chlorizidine A (1) is hindered, in part, by the lability of the pyrroloisoindolonemoeity toward",

Compounds 2, 4, and 5 showed similar activity.Irreversible methylation of the phenolic functionality in 1, yielding 3, rendered thecompound completely inactive. Any of the series of derivatives lacking the keypyrroloisoindolone ring system (7-14) had no measurable activity, strongly suggesting thatthis moiety is a crucial part of the metabolite\u2019s",

Against MDA-MB-231/ATCC breast cancer cells, anLC50 of 11 \u03bcM was also",
        "determined.Chlorizidine A (1) has obvious structural similarity to marinopyrrole A (15), a secondarymetabolite from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. CNQ-418 (Scheme 3).15 Biosyntheticprecursor 16 is derived from a mixed NRPS-PKS pathway, whereby proline is loaded onto apeptidyl carrier protein, oxidized, chlorinated by an FADH2-dependent halogenase, andsubsequently extended by the PKS machinery.16 Cyclization/aromatization providesmonodeoxypyoluteorin (17).17 1,3\u2019-Bipyrrole 15 is then formed via a novel atroposelectiveN,C-pyrrole coupling reaction.18 An alternative route using 16 that includes N-acylation andreduction could yield chlorizidine A (1).
