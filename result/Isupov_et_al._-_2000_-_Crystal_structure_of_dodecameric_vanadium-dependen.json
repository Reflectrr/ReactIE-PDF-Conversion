Brindley1 Yoshikazu Izumi2, Tadashi Tanabe3, Garib N. Murshudov4,5 and Jennifer A. Littlechild1* Introduction Many naturally occurring halogenated organic compounds have been isolated; this list is con-stantly increasing (Gribble, 1992). They are pro-duced by seaweeds, sponges, lichens and fungi and are thought to be associated with defence mechanisms preventing the organism from being eaten by predators and to aid colonisation in natu-ral habitats (Simons et al., 1995).

These enzymes have been isolated from a diverse range of organisms (Ahern et al., 1980; Manthey & Hager, 1981; Van Pee\u00c2 & Lingens, 1985; Zeng & Fenna, 1992; Itoh et al., 1994). Halo-peroxidases are named according to the most elec-tronegative halogen they oxidise (Hemrika et al., 1997). On the basis of their cofactor requirement they are classi\u00aeed into the three groups: heme-containing, vanadium-containing and metal-free haloperoxidases (Hemrika et al., 1997). A bromoperoxidase enzyme with an absolute requirement for vanadium (VBPO) was \u00aerst iso-lated from the brown macro-algae Ascophyllum nodosum (Wever et al., 1985). One molecule of vana-date per subunit was shown to be required for the enzyme activity (Wever et al., 1988).

The enzyme subunit is made up of 595 amino acid residues folded into a single a \u0087 b domain. There are 12 bromoperoxidase subunits, arranged with 23-point group symmetry. A cavity is formed by the N terminus of each subunit in the centre of the dodecamer. The subunit fold and dimer organisation of the Cor. of\u00aecinalis vanadium bromoperoxidase are similar to those of the dimeric enzyme from the brown algae Ascophyllum nodo-sum, with which it shares 33 % sequence identity. The different oligomeric state of the two algal enzymes seems to re\u00afect separate mechanisms of adaptation to harsh environmental conditions and/or to chemically active substrates and products. The residues involved in the vanadate binding are conserved between the two algal bromoperoxidases and the vanadium chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis. However, most of the other residues forming the active-site cavity are different in the three enzymes, which re\u00afects differences in the substrate speci\u00aecity and stereoselectivity of the reaction. A dimer of the Cor. of\u00aecinalis enzyme partially superimposes with the two-domain monomer of the fungal enzyme. # 2000 Academic Press Keywords: vanadium; haloperoxidase; dodecamer; enzyme structure; vanadium binding site *Corresponding author # 2000 Academic Press 1036 Vanadium-dependent Bromoperoxidase studies (Kusthardt et al., 1993) on the bromoperoxi-dase from A. nodosum (AVBPO) showed that the oxidation state of the metal was vanadium V. The redox state of the metal is not thought to change during turnover of the enzyme. It has been pro-posed that the function of the vanadium is to bind hydrogen peroxide to yield an activated peroxo intermediate, which is able to react with bromide to produce HOBr (Wever et al., 1988). Vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase enzymes have now been isolated from a number of marine algae (Wever et al., 1985; Itoh et al., 1986; Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1993 ) and also from some lichens and fungi (Van Schijndel et al., 1993; Plat et al., 1987). The primary amino acid sequence of the vanadium chloroperoxidases from the fungal species Curvularia inaequalis (Simons et al., 1995), Embellisia didymospora (Barnett et al., 1998) and Drechslera biseptata (partial sequence; Hemrika et al., 1997) show sequence identity in the range of 65-95 %. The two vanadium bromoperoxidases from the red macroalgae Corallina pilulifera (Shimonishi et al., 1998) show sequence identity of 91 % and the VBPOs from the brown macroalgae Fucus distichus (Vreeland et al., 1998) and A. nodosum (Vilter, 1995; Weyand et al., 1999) have a sequence identity of 86 %. The VBPO enzymes from the red algae show 32-34 % identity to those from the brown algae. There is, however, less sequence identity between the algal VBPO and the fungal vanadium chloro-peroxidase enzymes. Only the catalytic C-terminal regions can be aligned with no more than 26 % identity within a 103 amino acid residue overlap. The acid phosphatases show sequence identity to the vanadium-binding site motifs in haloperoxi-dase enzymes (Hemrika et al., 1997). The X-ray crystallographic structures of the chloroperoxidase from the fungus Cur. inaequalis in both the native and peroxide-bound forms have been determined (Messerschmidt & Wever, 1996; Messerschmidt et al., 1997). The monomer of the enzyme has two a-helical domains with a similar fold, the four a-helix bundles of each domain are related by approximately 180 None rotation (Messerschmidt & Wever, 1996). The active site is located at the end of a four-a-helix cluster in the C-terminal domain, the residues of the N-terminal domain contribute to the active site. Kinetic (Hemrika et al., 1999) and structural (Macedo-Ribeiro et al., 1999) studies of mutant chloroperoxi-dase proteins have recently shown the importance of histidine, which forms a chemical bond to vana-date and three basic residues involved in the vana-date-binding site for this chloroperoxidase reaction. A mechanism for the halogenation reac-tion was proposed by Messerschmidt & Wever (1996) and this has been developed by Hemrika et al. (1999). The crystal structure of the dimeric VBPO from the marine brown algae A. nodosum (Weyand et al., 1999) was recently reported which reinforced the proposed mechanism for chloroper-oxidase. Bromine K-edge EXAFS studies used to investigate the binding of bromide to AVBPO have suggested that the bromide ion does not coordinate to the vanadium centre, but is bound covalently to a carbon atom (Dau et al., 1999). The VBPO from the red macroalgae Cor. of\u00aecina-lis (CVBPO), a seaweed found on the south Devon coast, has been isolated and characterised (Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1993). It was suggested to be a homododecamer based on its subunit molecular mass of 64 kDa from SDS-gel electrophoresis, and a total molecular mass from equilibrium centrifu-gation studies of 740 kDa (Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1993). Itoh et al. (1986) reported the same subunit mol-ecular mass and the oligomer molecular mass of 790(None20) kDa for the related enzyme from Cor. pilulifera. The VBPO enzymes from Corallina species have been shown to be thermostable, stable to organic solvents and also resistant to high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1993; Itoh et al., 1986). These features make VBPO a candidate for use as an industrial catalyst in biotransform-ation reactions (Soedjak & Butler, 1990; Neidleman & Geigert, 1987; Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1995). CVBPO has been shown to perform regio-speci\u00aec bromination of cinnamyl substrates and aromatic heterocycles as well as the stereo-speci\u00aec oxidation of pro-chiral sulphide ions (Itoh et al., 1987, 1988; Coughlin et al., 1993; Anderson et al., 1997). The enzyme from Cor. of\u00aecinalis has been crystal-lised in two different forms (Rush et al., 1995; Brindley et al., 1998). A cubic crystal form was grown in the presence of vanadium, and a tetra-gonal form was grown from ammonium phos-phate. The phosphate group has been shown to compete with vanadate for binding in the enzyme active site (Hemrika et al., 1997). Preliminary crys-tallographic analysis has shown that the CVBPO dodecamer has its subunits arranged with a cubic 23-point group symmetry (Brindley et al., 1998). We report here the CVBPO crystal structure deter-mined to 2.3 A\u00ca resolution in its complex with inor-ganic phosphate and its comparison with the AVBPO and the Cur. inaequalis chloroperoxidase structures. Results and Discussion Quality of the model The CVBPO structure has been re\u00aened to an R-factor of 0.172 for all data in the resolution range 22-2.3 A\u00ca without a s cut-off. This excluded 2.0 % of the randomly distributed re\u00afections assigned to calculate the Rfree of 0.227. The asymmetric unit contains six subunits. One of the molecular dyads of the CVBPO dodecamer coincides with a diag-onal crystallographic 2-fold axis. The electron den-sity allowed the positioning of all 595 amino acid residues within each subunit. The model also con-tains 2186 water molecules, six phosphate ions and six magnesium ions. The dispersion-precision indicator (Murshudov & Dodson, 1997) gives an overall estimate of root Vanadium-dependent Bromoperoxidase 1037 mean square error in the co-ordinates of 0.18 A\u00ca for the well-de\u00aened part of the structure. The overall G-factor is 0.0 as calculated by the program PRO-CHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) used as a measure of the stereochemical quality of the model, which is better than expected for 2.3 A\u00ca resolution. Gly482 and Pro527 are in the cis conformation. 93 % of the non-glycine residues fall in the most favourable regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishan & Ramachandran, 1965) as de\u00aened by PROCHECK. Ala304 (f \u0088 83 None; c \u0088 11 None) and Phe371 (f \u0088 \u00ff 158 None; c \u0088 \u00ff 77 None) have unfavourable main-chain torsion angles in all six subunits. However, the electron density for these residues is unam-biguous and their B-factors are low. Approxi-mately 39 % of the amino acid residues are in a-helices, 7 % in b-sheets and 3 % in 310 helices. The six subunits were rebuilt independently and were re\u00aened with strict non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints, however, these were loosened for some loops involved in crystallo-graphic contacts. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between Ca positions of the six subunits is in the range 0.07-0.12 A\u00ca . Sequence building The complete amino acid sequence of the Cor. of-\u00aecinalis VBPO is not currently known. The partial sequence information for the enzyme has shown that it is closely related to the two VBPOs from the red algae Cor. pilulifera (Shimonishi et al., 1998) with over 90 % identity for the \u00aeve regions sequenced (C. Rush & J.A.L., unpublished data). The two amino acid sequences of the Cor. pilulifera enzymes were used as a basis for the side-chain assignments in the CVBPO X-ray structure. No electron density was observed for the N-terminal Met1 in any subunit, although glycine residues at position 2 are clearly de\u00aened in the electron density in each subunit. This is in agree-ment with the N-terminal sequence of the CVBPO (C. Rush & J.A.L., unpublished data) where Met at position 1 was absent. The VBPO1 sequence from Cor. pilulifera has a two-residue insertion after pos-ition 49 and VBPO2 sequence has a one-residue insertion (Shimonishi et al., 1998) after position 423. Neither of these insertions has been observed in the CVBPO electron density maps. The numbering of residues will be according to the CVBPO crystal model. The electron density maps were calculated using phases from the CVBPO enzyme structure with zero side-chain occupancy of the residue in ques-tion in order to resolve the sequence ambiguities in the primary structure of the Cor. of\u00aecinalis enzyme. The resulting 2Fo \u00ff Fc and Fo \u00ff Fc maps were inspected in all six subunits. These maps were con-sistent with the consensus sequence between the two Cor. pilulifera enzymes for 534 amino acid resi-dues out of 595 (89.7 % of total). Ten amino acid residues in each subunit were assigned to a differ-ent residue type from the consensus sequence (Figure 1). Out of 51 sequence differences between the two enzymes of the Cor. pilulifera, 33 were resolved in favour of VBPO2, 13 in favour of VBPO1 and \u00aeve were assigned a different amino acid type. An example of such an assignment is shown in Figure 2 for Asn419. This assignment was based not only on the shape of the electron density, but also on the H bonding which was not consistent with either Ile (VBPO1) or Lys (VBPO2). The cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the CVBPO gene is in progress (J.A.L., unpublished data). Once this is complete, further re\u00aenement of the X-ray model will be carried out. CVBPO structure The CVBPO subunit (Figure 3) measures approximately 85 A\u00ca None 56 A\u00ca None 55 A\u00ca in size. It is folded into a single a \u0087 b type domain of 595 amino acid residues. The \u00aerst ten N-terminal amino acid residues point away from the body of the domain which is composed of 19 a-helices from 6 to 26 residues in length. There are also eight 310 helices and 14 b-strands. The b-strands are mainly involved in b-hairpins. One of the sur-faces of the subunit is \u00afat. The assignment of the CVBPO secondary structural elements is shown in Figure 1. The CVBPO dimer is shown in Figure 4. The \u00afat surfaces of the two subunits complement each other, covering an area of 5260 A\u00ca 2 or 20.5 % of the subunit solvent accessible surface (AREAIMOL; CCP4, 1994). The residues 123-124 from one sub-unit and 368-369 from the other subunit in the dimer form a parallel two-stranded b-sheet. The b-hairpins 270-273 and 276-279 from each subunit in the dimer form an antiparallel four-stranded b-sheet. The vanadate-binding site is located at the bottom of the active-site cleft, which is about 20 A\u00ca deep and 14 A\u00ca wide. The active-site cleft is formed from residues of two different subunits in the dimer (Figure 4(b)). The residues of one subunit form the bottom of the cleft, and the top of the cleft is formed predominantly from the residues of the other subunit of the dimer. The involvement of residues from the neighbouring subunit in the active-site cleft would suggest that the CVBPO dimer is required to maintain speci\u00aecity and stereoselectivity for halogenation of organic substrates, despite the fact that all vanadate-binding residues come from one subunit. The CVBPO dodecamer measures None150 A\u00ca in diameter. Some 12 subunits are arranged with 23 cubic point group symmetry (Figure 5). This sym-metry has only been observed in two other enzyme structures to date, a DNA protection protein Dps from Escherichia coli (Grant et al., 1998) and an ornithine carbamoyltransferase enzyme from Pyro-coccus furiosus (Villeret et al., 1998). Each of the cubic faces is made up of a dimer. The N-terminal region of each subunit contributes to the formation of the central cavity (Figure 6). The diameter of this cavity is about 26 A\u00ca and does not have any Figure 1.

Summary of data collection and phasing 1048 Vanadium-dependent Bromoperoxidase was not in\u00afuenced by this co-ordinate error. However, phasing at 3 A\u00ca and the density modi\u00aecation at 2.5 A\u00ca were affected. Fortunately, the co-ordinate error intro-duced by re-indexing of the data was smaller for a sub-unit which belongs to a dimer related by a crystallographic dyad, since it lies closer to this dyad. This allowed the building of most of this subunit in the reduced cell. To summarise, the most computationally demanding steps of the structure determination can be accelerated in the reduced cell for which pseudosymme-try is treated as a proper crystallographic symmetry. The resulting phases are correct within the certain resolution limit which is determined by the deviation of the pseu-dosymmetry from the assumed crystal symmetry. This approach in the case of CVBPO gave reasonably good phases up to 3 A\u00ca resolution. These phases were then extended to the whole data set by the re\u00aenement in the proper unit cell.

        "The three-dimensional structure of the vanadium bromoperoxidase pro-tein from the marine red macroalgae Corallina of\u00aecinalis has been deter-mined by single isomorphous replacement at 2.3 A\u00ca resolution. The enzyme subunit is made up of 595 amino acid residues folded into a single a \u0087 b domain. There are 12 bromoperoxidase subunits, arranged with 23-point group symmetry. A cavity is formed by the N terminus of each subunit in the centre of the dodecamer. The subunit fold and dimer organisation of the Cor. of\u00aecinalis vanadium bromoperoxidase are similar to those of the dimeric enzyme from the brown algae Ascophyllum nodo-sum, with which it shares 33 % sequence identity. The different oligomeric state of the two algal enzymes seems to re\u00afect separate mechanisms of adaptation to harsh environmental conditions and/or to chemically active substrates and products. The residues involved in the vanadate binding are conserved between the two algal bromoperoxidases and the vanadium chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis. However, most of the other residues forming the active-site cavity are different in the three enzymes, which re\u00afects differences in the substrate speci\u00aecity and stereoselectivity of the reaction.

        "studies (Kusthardt et al., 1993) on the bromoperoxi-dase from A. nodosum (AVBPO) showed that the oxidation state of the metal was vanadium V. The redox state of the metal is not thought to change during turnover of the enzyme. It has been pro-posed that the function of the vanadium is to bind hydrogen peroxide to yield an activated peroxo intermediate, which is able to react with bromide to produce HOBr (Wever et al., 1988). Vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase enzymes have now been isolated from a number of marine algae (Wever et al., 1985; Itoh et al., 1986; Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1993 ) and also from some lichens and fungi (Van Schijndel et al., 1993; Plat et al., 1987).",
        "The primary amino acid sequence of the vanadium chloroperoxidases from the fungal species Curvularia inaequalis (Simons et al., 1995), Embellisia didymospora (Barnett et al., 1998) and Drechslera biseptata (partial sequence; Hemrika et al., 1997) show sequence identity in the range of 65-95 %. The two vanadium bromoperoxidases from the red macroalgae Corallina pilulifera (Shimonishi et al., 1998) show sequence identity of 91 % and the VBPOs from the brown macroalgae Fucus distichus (Vreeland et al., 1998) and A. nodosum (Vilter, 1995; Weyand et al., 1999) have a sequence identity of 86 %. The VBPO enzymes from the red algae show 32-34 % identity to those from the brown algae. There is, however, less sequence identity between the algal VBPO and the fungal vanadium chloro-peroxidase enzymes. Only the catalytic C-terminal regions can be aligned with no more than 26 % identity within a 103 amino acid residue overlap. The acid phosphatases show sequence identity to the vanadium-binding site motifs in haloperoxi-dase enzymes (Hemrika et al., 1997).",
        "The X-ray crystallographic structures of the chloroperoxidase from the fungus Cur. inaequalis in both the native and peroxide-bound forms have been determined (Messerschmidt & Wever, 1996; Messerschmidt et al., 1997). The monomer of the enzyme has two a-helical domains with a similar fold, the four a-helix bundles of each domain are related by approximately 180 None rotation (Messerschmidt & Wever, 1996). The active site is located at the end of a four-a-helix cluster in the C-terminal domain, the residues of the N-terminal domain contribute to the active site. Kinetic (Hemrika et al., 1999) and structural (Macedo-Ribeiro et al., 1999) studies of mutant chloroperoxi-dase proteins have recently shown the importance of histidine, which forms a chemical bond to vana-date and three basic residues involved in the vana-date-binding site for this chloroperoxidase reaction. A mechanism for the halogenation reac-tion was proposed by Messerschmidt & Wever (1996) and this has been developed by Hemrika et al. (1999). The crystal structure of the dimeric VBPO from the marine brown algae A. nodosum (Weyand et al., 1999) was recently reported which reinforced the proposed mechanism for chloroper-oxidase. Bromine K-edge EXAFS studies used to investigate the binding of bromide to AVBPO have suggested that the bromide ion does not coordinate to the vanadium centre, but is bound covalently to a carbon atom (Dau et al., 1999).",
        "The VBPO from the red macroalgae Cor. of\u00aecina-lis (CVBPO), a seaweed found on the south Devon coast, has been isolated and characterised (Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1993). It was suggested to be a homododecamer based on its subunit molecular mass of 64 kDa from SDS-gel electrophoresis, and a total molecular mass from equilibrium centrifu-gation studies of 740 kDa (Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1993). Itoh et al. (1986) reported the same subunit mol-ecular mass and the oligomer molecular mass of 790(None20) kDa for the related enzyme from Cor. pilulifera.",
        "The VBPO enzymes from Corallina species have been shown to be thermostable, stable to organic solvents and also resistant to high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1993; Itoh et al., 1986). These features make VBPO a candidate for use as an industrial catalyst in biotransform-ation reactions (Soedjak & Butler, 1990; Neidleman & Geigert, 1987; Shef\u00aeeld et al., 1995). CVBPO has been shown to perform regio-speci\u00aec bromination of cinnamyl substrates and aromatic heterocycles as well as the stereo-speci\u00aec oxidation of pro-chiral sulphide ions (Itoh et al., 1987, 1988; Coughlin et al., 1993; Anderson et al., 1997).",
        "The enzyme from Cor. of\u00aecinalis has been crystal-lised in two different forms (Rush et al., 1995; Brindley et al., 1998). A cubic crystal form was grown in the presence of vanadium, and a tetra-gonal form was grown from ammonium phos-phate. The phosphate group has been shown to compete with vanadate for binding in the enzyme active site (Hemrika et al., 1997). Preliminary crys-tallographic analysis has shown that the CVBPO dodecamer has its subunits arranged with a cubic 23-point group symmetry (Brindley et al., 1998). We report here the CVBPO crystal structure deter-mined to 2.3 A\u00ca resolution in its complex with inor-ganic phosphate and its comparison with the AVBPO and the Cur. inaequalis chloroperoxidase structures.",
        "Results and Discussion Quality of the model",
        "The CVBPO structure has been re\u00aened to an R-factor of 0.172 for all data in the resolution range 22-2.3 A\u00ca without a s cut-off. This excluded 2.0 % of the randomly distributed re\u00afections assigned to calculate the Rfree of 0.227. The asymmetric unit contains six subunits. One of the molecular dyads of the CVBPO dodecamer coincides with a diag-onal crystallographic 2-fold axis. The electron den-sity allowed the positioning of all 595 amino acid residues within each subunit. The model also con-tains 2186 water molecules, six phosphate ions and six magnesium ions.",

        "mean square error in the co-ordinates of 0.18 A\u00ca for the well-de\u00aened part of the structure. The overall G-factor is 0.0 as calculated by the program PRO-CHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) used as a measure of the stereochemical quality of the model, which is better than expected for 2.3 A\u00ca resolution. Gly482 and Pro527 are in the cis conformation. 93 % of the non-glycine residues fall in the most favourable regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishan & Ramachandran, 1965) as de\u00aened by PROCHECK. Ala304 (f \u0088 83 None; c \u0088 11 None) and Phe371 (f \u0088 \u00ff 158 None; c \u0088 \u00ff 77 None) have unfavourable main-chain torsion angles in all six subunits. However, the electron density for these residues is unam-biguous and their B-factors are low. Approxi-mately 39 % of the amino acid residues are in a-helices, 7 % in b-sheets and 3 % in 310 helices.",
        "The six subunits were rebuilt independently and were re\u00aened with strict non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints, however, these were loosened for some loops involved in crystallo-graphic contacts. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between Ca positions of the six subunits is in the range 0.07-0.12 A\u00ca .",
        "Sequence building",
        "The complete amino acid sequence of the Cor. of-\u00aecinalis VBPO is not currently known. The partial sequence information for the enzyme has shown that it is closely related to the two VBPOs from the red algae Cor. pilulifera (Shimonishi et al., 1998) with over 90 % identity for the \u00aeve regions sequenced (C. Rush & J.A.L., unpublished data). The two amino acid sequences of the Cor. pilulifera enzymes were used as a basis for the side-chain assignments in the CVBPO X-ray structure.",
        "No electron density was observed for the N-terminal Met1 in any subunit, although glycine residues at position 2 are clearly de\u00aened in the electron density in each subunit. This is in agree-ment with the N-terminal sequence of the CVBPO (C. Rush & J.A.L., unpublished data) where Met at position 1 was absent. The VBPO1 sequence from Cor. pilulifera has a two-residue insertion after pos-ition 49 and VBPO2 sequence has a one-residue insertion (Shimonishi et al., 1998) after position 423. Neither of these insertions has been observed in the CVBPO electron density maps. The numbering of residues will be according to the CVBPO crystal model.",
        "The electron density maps were calculated using phases from the CVBPO enzyme structure with zero side-chain occupancy of the residue in ques-tion in order to resolve the sequence ambiguities in the primary structure of the Cor. of\u00aecinalis enzyme. The resulting 2Fo \u00ff Fc and Fo \u00ff Fc maps were inspected in all six subunits. These maps were con-sistent with the consensus sequence between the two Cor. pilulifera enzymes for 534 amino acid resi-dues out of 595 (89.7 % of total). Ten amino acid residues in each subunit were assigned to a differ-ent residue type from the consensus sequence (Figure 1). Out of 51 sequence differences between the two enzymes of the Cor. pilulifera, 33 were resolved in favour of VBPO2, 13 in favour of VBPO1 and \u00aeve were assigned a different amino acid type. An example of such an assignment is shown in Figure 2 for Asn419. This assignment was based not only on the shape of the electron density, but also on the H bonding which was not consistent with either Ile (VBPO1) or Lys (VBPO2).",
        "The cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the CVBPO gene is in progress (J.A.L., unpublished data). Once this is complete, further re\u00aenement of the X-ray model will be carried out.",
        "CVBPO structure",
        "The CVBPO subunit (Figure 3) measures approximately 85 A\u00ca None 56 A\u00ca None 55 A\u00ca in size. It is folded into a single a \u0087 b type domain of 595 amino acid residues. The \u00aerst ten N-terminal amino acid residues point away from the body of the domain which is composed of 19 a-helices from 6 to 26 residues in length. There are also eight 310 helices and 14 b-strands. The b-strands are mainly involved in b-hairpins. One of the sur-faces of the subunit is \u00afat. The assignment of the CVBPO secondary structural elements is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The CVBPO dimer is shown in Figure 4. The \u00afat surfaces of the two subunits complement each other, covering an area of 5260 A\u00ca 2 or 20.5 % of the subunit solvent accessible surface (AREAIMOL; CCP4, 1994). The residues 123-124 from one sub-unit and 368-369 from the other subunit in the dimer form a parallel two-stranded b-sheet. The b-hairpins 270-273 and 276-279 from each subunit in the dimer form an antiparallel four-stranded b-sheet. The vanadate-binding site is located at the bottom of the active-site cleft, which is about 20 A\u00ca deep and 14 A\u00ca wide. The active-site cleft is formed from residues of two different subunits in the dimer (Figure 4(b)). The residues of one subunit form the bottom of the cleft, and the top of the cleft is formed predominantly from the residues of the other subunit of the dimer. The involvement of residues from the neighbouring subunit in the active-site cleft would suggest that the CVBPO dimer is required to maintain speci\u00aecity and stereoselectivity for halogenation of organic substrates, despite the fact that all vanadate-binding residues come from one subunit.",
        "The CVBPO dodecamer measures None150 A\u00ca in diameter. Some 12 subunits are arranged with 23 cubic point group symmetry (Figure 5). This sym-metry has only been observed in two other enzyme structures to date, a DNA protection protein Dps from Escherichia coli (Grant et al., 1998) and an ornithine carbamoyltransferase enzyme from Pyro-coccus furiosus (Villeret et al., 1998). Each of the cubic faces is made up of a dimer. The N-terminal region of each subunit contributes to the formation of the central cavity (Figure 6).

Fortunately, the co-ordinate error intro-duced by re-indexing of the data was smaller for a sub-unit which belongs to a dimer related by a crystallographic dyad, since it lies closer to this dyad. This allowed the building of most of this subunit in the reduced cell. To summarise, the most computationally demanding steps of the structure determination can be accelerated in the reduced cell for which pseudosymme-try is treated as a proper crystallographic symmetry. The resulting phases are correct within the certain resolution limit which is determined by the deviation of the pseu-dosymmetry from the assumed crystal symmetry. This approach in the case of CVBPO gave reasonably good phases up to 3 A\u00ca resolution. These phases were then extended to the whole data set by the re\u00aenement in the proper unit cell.",
