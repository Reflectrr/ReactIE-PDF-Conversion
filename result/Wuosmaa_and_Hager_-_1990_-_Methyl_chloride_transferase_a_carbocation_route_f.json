HAGER Enzymatic synthesis of methyl halides through an S-adenosyl methionine transfer mechanism has been detected in cell extracts of Phellinus promaceus (a white rot fimgus), Endocladia muricata (a marine red algae), and Mesembryanthemum crystallium (ice plant). This mechanism represents a novel pathway for the formation ofhalometa-bolites. The Michaelis constants for chloride and bromide ion and for S-adenosyl methionine in the reaction have been determined for the enzyme from E. muricata. A recent survey of marine algae indicates that there may be a broad distribution of this enzyme among marine algae. T HE MOST ABUNDANT HALOHYDRO-carbon species in the upper atmo-sphere is methyl chloride, and it is widely believed that biological synthesis is largely responsible for sustaining a global emission rate estimated to be 5 x 106 tons of methyl chloride per year (1). The synthe-sis of methyl chloride by cultures of wood rot fungi has been well documented (2), and there have been isolated studies reporting the in vivo synthesis of methyl halides by marine macroalgae and phytoplankton (3). However, in vitro methyl chloride synthesis has not been reported. The established enzy-matic mechanism for the biosynthesis of halometabolites involves the hydrogen per-oxide-dependent oxidation of halides to form electrophilic halogenating species (4). The electrophilic halogen intermediate gen-erated in the peroxidase-reaction can react with a broad spectrum of nucleophilic ac-ceptors to form the halometabolites. In our laboratory we demonstrated the synthesis of one prevalent atmospheric halohydrocar-bon, methyltribromide, through the peroxi-datic route (5). In the synthesis of this compound, bromoperoxidase first catalyzes the multiple bromination of an activated methylene carbon atom adjacent to a ketone function (6). The enzymatic bromination reaction is followed by the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the tribrominated methyl group to release methyltribromide in a clas-sical bromoform reaction. However, all of our attempts to detect monohalomethanes through chloro-or bromoperoxidase-type reactions have been unsuccessful. Thus we have recently turned our attention to a potential altemative route for the synthesis of methyl halides. White (7) has shown that when the fungus Phellinus pomaceus is grown on deuterium-labeled glucose, serine, or me-thionine, the methyl chloride produced is also labeled. This observation is consistent with the methyl chloride being derived from methionine. A likely route for this reaction would be through the methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine. We report the detec-tion and partial purification of a methyl transferase that catalyzes the methylation of chloride, bromide, and iodide ions. Methyl chloride transferase activity has been detected in cell-free extracts prepared from the fungus P. pomaceus, from the ma-Table 1. Methyl transferase activity levels in whole cells and crude cell extracts. The activity measurements for fungal cells were obtained by growing cultures in 100 ml of 5% malt extract, 100 mM KCI, 1% bactopeptone liquid media in sealed bottles. Gas samples were removed each day and analyzed as described in Fig. 1. Known amounts of methyl chloride in identically pre-pared bottles were used as standards. The value reported here was the amount of methyl chloride obtained during peak production periods. The values for whole cells of E. muricata and M. crystallium were obtained by incubating whole cells in 100 mM KCI in gas-tight vials. Gas samples were analyzed as in Fig. 1 with known amounts of methyl chloride as standards. The values for all crude cell extracts were obtained by incubating the cell extracts in 4-ml reaction mix-tures containing 250 mM KCI, 500 ,uM SAM, 100 mM phosphate, pH 6.8. The P. pomaceus cell extracts were obtained by digesting cells with 10 mg of Novozyme 234 per milliliter for 1 hour followed by removal of cell debris by centrifuga-tion. Cell extracts of E. muricata were obtained as in Fig. 1. Cell extracts of M. crystallium were obtained by grinding the cells in a Waring blend-er. Gas samples were analyzed in the same manner as those from whole cells.

Controls show that the presence of enzyme is necessary for methyl halide production. The synthesis of methyl chloride and other methyl halides was confirmed by gas chro-matography-mass spectroscopy. All of the enzymes appear in the cytosolic fraction after cell disruption with a small amount of activity being pelleted with the cell debris. The rate of methyl chloride production found in the crude cell free extracts of each organism is compared with this same activi-ty in whole cells in Table 1. The methyl chloride transferase has been purified 800-fold from extracts of E. muricata. The purifi-cation was achieved by an 80 to 100% ammonium sulfate precipitation step fol-lowed by a high-performance liquid chro-matography (HPLC) gel filtration step on a 60 cm by 2.15 cm preparative Bio-Sil SEC-250 column. The column was eluted with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by gel filtration is in the range of 20,000 to 25,000 daltons. No prosthetic group or cofactor requirement has been found for the E. muricata enzyme or the P. pomaceus enzyme. The partially purified en-zyme catalyzes methyl bromide synthesis at a rate of 555 picomoles per minute per milli-gram of protein. This value compares favor-ably with other methyl transferase enzymes, which have specific activities in the range of 166 to 5800 picomoles per minute per milligram of protein (9). The effect ofpH and substrate concentra-tions on the algal enzyme is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The enzyme shows maximal activity in the pH range 7.5 to 7.6. At pH values greater than 9.2, no methyl bromide pro-duction could be detected. The Michaelis constant Km for bromide ion in the reaction is 40 mM, and the Km for S-adenosyl me-thionine in the reaction is 16 ,uM. The Km for chloride ion is approximately 5 mM. As might be expected, the order of reac-tivity ofthe methyl transferase with different halide ions follows the order iodide, bro-mide, and chloride, with chloride being the poorest acceptor. This reactivity matches the expected order, since the rate ofreaction ofa carbocation with a halide should be depen-dent upon the nucleophilicity of the accep-tor anion (10). Iodide is by far the preferred acceptor, the rate with iodide exceeding the bromide rate by more than two orders of magnitude. Fluoride is not a substrate. The rate of synthesis of the methyl halides at saturating concentrations of halides with identical enzyme concentrations is shown in Table 2. It has been Table 2. Comparison of the production of differ-ent methyl halides by methyl chloride transferase from E. murcata. Crude extract, prepared as in Fig. 2, was incubated in 4-ml reaction volumes containing 250 mM ofthe appropriate potassium halide, 10 mM phosphate, pH 7.58, and 500 p.M SAM. Reactions were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 6 hours. Gas samples were removed and analyzed as in Fig. 1 except the appropriate methyl halide was used as a standard. The synthesis of all methyl halides was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Methyl Rate of methyl halide production halide (pmol liter-' min-') CH3CI 8 CH3Br 16 CH3I 2165 were identified as methyl chloride produc-ers. Thus it is likely that the methyl transfer-ase enzyme is a constitutive activity in a variety of microorganisms and marine algae. The presence of the enzyme in ice plant, a terrestrial plant which grows in great abun-dance in the California coastal soils, is an interesting observation that perhaps signals a need for a survey of methyl chloride transferase activity in other succulents that grow in saline-rich environments. Also note-worthy is the fact that ice plant has a wide global distribution. Although the produc-tion of 5 x 106 tons per year represents a prodigious rate ofmethyl chloride synthesis, this number may be quite understandable in terms of the large terrestrial and marine biomass that can contribute to its formation.

I NTERPLAY BETWEEN POSrTiVE AND negative regulators determines whether a cell will grow and divide, with onco-genes stimulating and anti-oncogenes (tu-mor suppressor genes) inhibiting these pro-cesses. Considerable insight has been gained into the mechanism by which oncogenes stimulate cell proliferation; however, much less is known about mechanisms of anti-oncogene function (1). Although the pro-teins ofsome anti-oncogenes are structurally unrelated to those of oncogenes, the Krev-I anti-oncogene (2) encodes a protein that is structurally related to the ras oncogene-encoded proteins (3), with which it shares about 50% sequence similarity (4, 5). As is true of ras-encoded proteins, the Krev-i-encoded protein binds guanine nucleotides and possesses a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity (4). Krev-1 induces morphological reversion of a cell line transformed by a ras oncogene. Because the reverted line still expresses the transforming ras gene, Krev-i may inhibit ras function by interfering with some aspect of the ras pathway (2). To test this hypothesis, we identified the sequences in ras and Krev-I that account for their opposing biological activities. If the critical differences between the two proteins were limited to a few amino acids, it would focus attention on the K. Zhang, W. C. Vass, A. G. Papageorge, D. R.

Therefore we have made a series of ras-Krev-chimeric genes and studied their ability to induce cellular transformation and to suppress ras-induced transformation. The proteins encoded by Krev-i and ras are 184 and 189 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). Sequence alignment indicates that the two proteins are colinear, with Krev-i encoding two additional amino acids be-tween ras residues 120 to 136, and seven fewer amino acids between ras residues 161 to 186. Compared with Krev-i, 70% of the NH2-terminal 60 amino acids encoded by rasH are identical, 60% of the next 60 resi-dues are identical, and 33% of the COOH-terminal residues are identical. The highly transforming v-ras-AT gene that we used for our chimeric constructions was derived from the Harvey murine sarco-ma virus oncogene (6, 7) (Fig. 1). The protein product ofv-ras-AT differed from c-ras by only two amino acids, a highly activat-ing Arg'2 in place of Gly, and Thr6l in place ofGin (Fig. 1). To facilitate construction of ras-Krev-i chimeric genes, we engineered restriction endonuclease deavage sites at comparable regions of each gene. This change resulted in restriction endonuclease sites at nucleotides encoding amino acids 5 (Hind III), 60 (Pst I), 109 (Aat II), and 146 (Hae II). In ras, the Hind III site is present in the wild-type gene, and the mutations that created the Aat II and Hae II sites were silent. The mutations required to make the Pst I site changed Thr59, which is specific to v-ras, to Ala, the amino acid encoded by c-SCIENCE, VOL. 249 Identification of Small Chlsters of Divergent Amino Adds That Mediate the Opposing Effects of ras and Krev-l KE ZHANG, MAZKOTO NODA, WILLIAM C. VASS, ALEX G. PAPAGEORGE, DOUGLAS R. Lowy Krev-i is an anti-oncogene that was originally identified by its ability to induce morphologic reversion of ras-transformed celis that continue to express the ras gene. The Krev-i-encoded protein is structurally related to Ras proteins. The biological activities of a series of ras-Krev-1 chimeras were studied to test the hypothesis that Krev-i may directly interfere with a ras function. The ras-specific and Krev-i-specific amino acids immediately surrounding residues 32 to 44, which are identical between the two proteins, determined whether the protein induced cellular transformation or suppressed ras transformation. Because this region in Ras proteins has been implicated in effector function, the results suggest that Krev-i suppresses ras-induced transforma-tion by interfering with interaction of Ras with its effector.

        "rine algae, Endocladia muricata, and from the terrestrial succulent, Mesembryanthemum crys-tallium, commonly known as ice plant (8). Controls show that the presence of enzyme is necessary for methyl halide production. The synthesis of methyl chloride and other methyl halides was confirmed by gas chro-matography-mass spectroscopy. All of the enzymes appear in the cytosolic fraction after cell disruption with a small amount of activity being pelleted with the cell debris. The rate of methyl chloride production found in the crude cell free extracts of each organism is compared with this same activi-ty in whole cells in Table 1. The methyl chloride transferase has been purified 800-fold from extracts of E. muricata. The purifi-cation was achieved by an 80 to 100% ammonium sulfate precipitation step fol-lowed by a high-performance liquid chro-matography (HPLC) gel filtration step on a 60 cm by 2.15 cm preparative Bio-Sil SEC-250 column. The column was eluted with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by gel filtration is in the range of 20,000 to 25,000 daltons. No prosthetic group or cofactor requirement has been found for the E. muricata enzyme or the P. pomaceus enzyme. The partially purified en-zyme catalyzes methyl bromide synthesis at a rate of 555 picomoles per minute per milli-gram of protein. This value compares favor-ably with other methyl transferase enzymes, which have specific activities in the range of 166 to 5800 picomoles per minute per milligram of protein (9).",
        "The effect ofpH and substrate concentra-tions on the algal enzyme is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The enzyme shows maximal activity in the pH range 7.5 to 7.6. At pH values greater than 9.2, no methyl bromide pro-duction could be detected. The Michaelis constant Km for bromide ion in the reaction is 40 mM, and the Km for S-adenosyl me-thionine in the reaction is 16 ,uM. The Km for chloride ion is approximately 5 mM.",
        "As might be expected, the order of reac-tivity ofthe methyl transferase with different halide ions follows the order iodide, bro-mide, and chloride, with chloride being the poorest acceptor. This reactivity matches the expected order, since the rate ofreaction ofa carbocation with a halide should be depen-dent upon the nucleophilicity of the accep-tor anion (10). Iodide is by far the preferred acceptor, the rate with iodide exceeding the bromide rate by more than two orders of magnitude. Fluoride is not a substrate. The rate of synthesis of the methyl halides at saturating concentrations of halides with identical enzyme concentrations is shown in Table 2. It has been",

The presence of the enzyme in ice plant, a terrestrial plant which grows in great abun-dance in the California coastal soils, is an interesting observation that perhaps signals a need for a survey of methyl chloride transferase activity in other succulents that grow in saline-rich environments. Also note-worthy is the fact that ice plant has a wide global distribution. Although the produc-tion of 5 x 106 tons per year represents a prodigious rate ofmethyl chloride synthesis, this number may be quite understandable in terms of the large terrestrial and marine biomass that can contribute to its formation.",

        "I NTERPLAY BETWEEN POSrTiVE AND negative regulators determines whether a cell will grow and divide, with onco-genes stimulating and anti-oncogenes (tu-mor suppressor genes) inhibiting these pro-cesses. Considerable insight has been gained into the mechanism by which oncogenes stimulate cell proliferation; however, much less is known about mechanisms of anti-oncogene function (1). Although the pro-teins ofsome anti-oncogenes are structurally unrelated to those of oncogenes, the Krev-I anti-oncogene (2) encodes a protein that is structurally related to the ras oncogene-encoded proteins (3), with which it shares about 50% sequence similarity (4, 5). As is true of ras-encoded proteins, the Krev-i-encoded protein binds guanine nucleotides and possesses a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity (4).",

Therefore we have made a series of ras-Krev-chimeric genes and studied their ability to induce cellular transformation and to suppress ras-induced transformation. The proteins encoded by Krev-i and ras are 184 and 189 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). Sequence alignment indicates that the two proteins are colinear, with Krev-i encoding two additional amino acids be-tween ras residues 120 to 136, and seven fewer amino acids between ras residues 161 to 186. Compared with Krev-i, 70% of the NH2-terminal 60 amino acids encoded by rasH are identical, 60% of the next 60 resi-dues are identical, and 33% of the COOH-terminal residues are identical. The highly transforming v-ras-AT gene that we used for our chimeric constructions was derived from the Harvey murine sarco-ma virus oncogene (6, 7) (Fig. 1). The protein product ofv-ras-AT differed from c-ras by only two amino acids, a highly activat-ing Arg'2 in place of Gly, and Thr6l in place ofGin (Fig. 1). To facilitate construction of ras-Krev-i chimeric genes, we engineered restriction endonuclease deavage sites at comparable regions of each gene. This change resulted in restriction endonuclease sites at nucleotides encoding amino acids 5 (Hind III), 60 (Pst I), 109 (Aat II), and 146 (Hae II). In ras, the Hind III site is present in the wild-type gene, and the mutations that created the Aat II and Hae II sites were silent. The mutations required to make the Pst I site changed Thr59, which is specific to v-ras, to Ala, the amino acid encoded by c-",

The Krev-i-encoded protein is structurally related to Ras proteins. The biological activities of a series of ras-Krev-1 chimeras were studied to test the hypothesis that Krev-i may directly interfere with a ras function. The ras-specific and Krev-i-specific amino acids immediately surrounding residues 32 to 44, which are identical between the two proteins, determined whether the protein induced cellular transformation or suppressed ras transformation. Because this region in Ras proteins has been implicated in effector function, the results suggest that Krev-i suppresses ras-induced transforma-tion by interfering with interaction of Ras with its effector.",
