In the present study, compound MC0704 was found to be a novel synthetic STAT3 pathway inhibitor, and its potential antitumor activity was demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo models in docetaxel-resistant TNBC cells. Based on marinacarboline (MC), a series \u03b2-carboline derivatives were synthesized and investigated for their antitumor activities against docetaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 (MDA-MB-231-DTR) cells. Combining antiproliferation and STAT3 inhibitory activities, MC0704 was selected as the most promising \u03b2-carboline compound. MC0704 effectively impeded the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231-DTR cells in vitro, and the combination of MC0704 and docetaxel exhibited potent antitumor activities in a xenograft mouse model. These findings suggested that MC0704 can be a lead candidate as a target therapeutic agent for TNBC patients with docetaxel resistance. INTRODUCTION Cancer is still one of the leading causes of human death worldwide.1 Three solid cancers, including lung, breast, and colon cancers, are more prevalent among all malignancies.2 In particular, breast cancer (BC) is one of the main causes of cancer-associated death in women due to its high recurrence and/or metastatic potential. Although several strategies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, are frequently applied for the management of BC, chemo-therapy remains the most basic treatment strategy.3,4 There-fore, the discovery of novel molecules targeting a potential mechanism is considered an essential direction in the development of small-molecule-based anticancer drugs. BC is typically categorized into respective subtypes based on the presence of representative receptors (the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor).5 Hence, these surface receptors are promising therapeutic targets for drug development against breast cancers (BCs). However, about 20% of BC does not express all of these three receptors and is classified as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).6 Due to a lack of particular therapeutic targets and an increased metastatic potential, TNBC patients usually show a relatively worse clinical outcome than patients with other BC subtypes.7 In the clinic, taxane-based cytotoxic anticancer agents, such as paclitaxel or docetaxel, have been used to treat TNBC, and these drugs have been reported to be the most effective. However, there is no other option when resistance occurs after long-term treatment.8 Therefore, the development of a novel agent with a promising molecular mechanism is urgently needed. Both extrinsic and intrinsic signals activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family by phosphorylation on a conserved tyrosine residue. STAT3, a STAT family member, is activated by various cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes, and it is constitutively active in a high percentage of cancers and cancer-derived cell lines, including TNBC cells. A body of evidence suggests that STAT3 governs cancer progression, antiapoptosis, invasion, migration, and acquired drug resistance by participating in several intrinsic signaling pathways.9-11 In addition, our previous studies revealed that STAT3 inhibitors effectively regulate the growth of TNBC.5,8 Therefore, the development of an effective compound that modulates STAT3 is considered to be an effective treatment for TNBC. A J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX Natural products have been an abundant source of compounds for drug discovery, and many anticancer drugs currently used in clinical treatments originate from natural product scaffolds, such as vinblastine and paclitaxel.12 Among these natural products, \u03b2-carbolines, a class of indole alkaloids, contain the specific tricyclic pyrido-[3,4-b] indole ring, which belongs to an important moiety of bioactive natural products found in nature (Figure 1). \u03b2-Carboline alkaloids, such as harmine, pityriacitrin, and marinacarboline (MC), have been reported to display antiproliferative activity against many cancer cell lines.13-17 Marinacarboline, a marine \u03b2-carboline alkaloid bearing an acetyl group attached at the C-1 position and an amide group attached at the C-3 position, is of particular interest due to its unique structure and intriguing biological profile. Marinacarbolines A-D were first isolated from Marinactinospora thermotolerans in 2011 and evaluated for their antimalarial activities.18 Subsequently, several research groups have made efforts to synthesize marinacarboline and its derivatives, and their potential anticancer activities have also been investigated.19,20 Recently, additional alkaloids, namely, marinacarbolines E-Q, have been isolated from the actino-mycete Actinoalloteichus sp. ZZ1866, and these compounds also exhibit antiproliferative activities against several cancer cell lines.21 However, the low production yields of these natural compounds by cultivation limit further study on exploring biological applications. These factors have prompted our group to investigate efficient synthetic methods for these \u03b2-carboline compounds. Therefore, as part of our ongoing effort for anticancer therapeutics development, we report herein the molecular design, efficient synthetic methods, and biological assessment of \u03b2-carboline compounds derived from natural marinacarbolines. Previous findings15,22,23 have suggested that the substituents at positions 1 and 3 of \u03b2-carboline play an important role in antiproliferation activity against cancer cells. In the present study, the marinacarboline scaffold was used as a key unit, and various substitutions were planned to provide both C-1 ketone and C-3 amide groups based on the core \u03b2-carboline structure as depicted in Figure 2. Therefore, a series of novel \u03b2-carboline derivatives were designed and synthesized, and their cytotoxic activities against a TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) were evaluated for their structure-activity relationships (SARs). Biological investigations of novel marinacarboline analogues for STAT3 activity were also summarized and discussed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Chemistry. First, a series of \u03b2-carboline derivatives based on natural marinacarbolines were synthesized by introducing various amide functional groups on the 3-position \u03b2-carboline pharmacophore (Scheme 1). L-Tryptophan methyl ester was selected as a starting material and was transformed into \u03b2-carboline MC01A via oxidative annulation with acetone.24 Acetone was converted to 2-oxoaldehydes in situ by iodine and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and Pictet-Spengler-type ring closure occurred. The methyl ester in MC01A was conveniently hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid MC01B in the presence of sodium hydroxide solution in methanol. With the carboxylic acid MC01B in hand, amide coupling with various amines afforded the \u03b2-carboline derivatives MC0101-MC0133 using hexafluorophosphate benzotriazole tetramethyl uronium (HBTU) as a coupling agent. The structures of the synthesized compounds are displayed with cytotoxic activities in Table 1. The ester-type derivative MC0134 was also synthesized through the same protocol using tryptophol instead of amine. Next, our synthetic focus was changed to diversify the substituent on the C-1 position of the \u03b2-carboline scaffold. At the C-3 position, we planned to introduce mainly an N-ethyl 3-indole amide, similar to marinacarboline D, which is the most potent natural marinacarboline. According to a previous synthetic method, various ketone groups were introduced at the C-1 position to synthesize the \u03b2-carboline derivatives MC0204-MC0904 (Scheme 2). Furthermore, MC0523-and MC0723-substituted 4-hydroxybenzyl amide group at the C-3 position were synthesized through amide coupling with 4-hydroxybenzyl amine. The C-1 phenyl-substituted derivatives MC1004-MC1304 were also synthesized using benzaldehyde instead of a ketone in oxidative Pictet-Spengler condensation. The chemical structures of the C-1-diversified \u03b2-carboline derivatives are shown with cytotoxic activities in Table 2. The purities of all synthetic compounds were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to be >95.0%. Detailed synthetic procedure and characterization of these compounds are described in the Experimental Section. Cytotoxicity. All prepared marinacarboline (MC) deriva-tives and marinacaboline A-D were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and MRC-5 (normal lung fibroblast) cells by the SRB assay, and the results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1. Representative natural \u03b2-carboline alkaloids. Figure 2. Design strategy of \u03b2-carboline analogues derived from natural marinacarbolines. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX B As a result, the substituent structures of the C-3 position on MC0101-MC0134 and their IC50 values for cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells are displayed in Table 1. Among the natural marinacarbolines, marinacarboline D (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity, and the data were consistent with previous findings.20 Methyl ester and carboxylic acid intermediates (MC01A-B, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) did not exhibit cytotoxic activity, and the ester derivative (MC0134, IC50 = 9.52 \u03bcM) also showed relatively lower inhibition activities compared to its amide analogue, marinacarboline D. Focusing on substituents of amide and aliphatic groups provided poor cytotoxicity (MC0105-06, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM; MC0107, IC50 = 37.28 \u03bcM); however, an amine or hydroxyl group attached to the aliphatic chain slightly improved cytotoxicity (MC0108, IC50 = 11.34 \u03bcM; MC0109, IC50 = 16.47 \u03bcM). Although phenyl groups were also poor substituents for cytotoxicity (MC0110-12, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM), the introduction of an amine at the para-position increased the activity (MC0113, IC50 = 10.79 \u03bcM). The 5-indole group was also found to be a good substituent for cytotoxicity (MC0114, IC50 = 6.98 \u03bcM), but the insertion of a carbon between the amide nitrogen and the 5-carbon of indole slightly decreased the activity (MC0115, IC50 = 14.88 \u03bcM). Although a simple benzyl substituent was less effective (MC0116, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM), the additional substituents at the para-position also affected the cytotoxicity (MC0117-23). In particular, the introduction of a hydroxy group at the benzyl substituent showed strong cytotoxicity (MC0122, IC50 = 16.28 \u03bcM; MC0123, IC50 = 3.51 \u03bcM). It is interesting to note that the meta-positioned hydroxy group exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the para-and ortho-positioned hydroxy groups (MC0124, IC50 = 27.69 \u03bcM; MC0125, IC50 = 10.34 \u03bcM). Based on the amide substituent of marinacarboline D, two carbon lengths between the amide nitrogen and 3-carbon of indole were effective for cytotoxicity (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM; MC0126, IC50 = 14.26 \u03bcM; MC0127, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). Additional substitutions of indole did not show a significant improvement in cytotoxicity (MC0128, IC50 = 5.94 \u03bcM; MC0129, IC50 = 10.84 \u03bcM; MC0130, IC50 > 11.28 \u03bcM). All tertiary amide derivatives (MC0131 and MC0132, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM; MC0133, IC50 = 20.80 \u03bcM) tended to decrease the cytotoxicity. Moreover, all of the active compounds also showed relatively selective cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells compared to normal lung fibroblast cells. In addition, MC derivatives at the C-1 position of \u03b2-carboline were also investigated for cytotoxicity using the same cell line (Table 2). In the case of the ketone group at the C-1 position of \u03b2-carboline, simple elongation of the carbon chain from methyl to n-propyl provided diminished cytotoxicity (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM; MC0204, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). When benzyl ketone was applied at the C-1 position (MC0304, IC50 = 21.25 \u03bcM), it was less effective than the acetyl derivative. However, an additional substituent at the para-position of the benzyl group significantly increased the cytotoxicity (MC0404, IC50 = 8.29 \u03bcM; MC0504, IC50 = 6.82 \u03bcM; MC0604, IC50 = 14.69 \u03bcM; MC0704, IC50 = 3.11 \u03bcM). Notably, compound MC0704 (p-bromo-benzyl ketone derivative) exhibited significant cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells, and it was more potent than the natural marinacarboline D (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM). Interestingly, only para-substituted benzyl ketone analogues were effective compared to meta-and ortho-substituted derivatives (MC0804-MC0904, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). To investigate the cytotoxic effects of the carbonyl group at the C-1 position, prepared benzyl analogues were also tested for cytotoxicity using the same cell line. Although the C-1 benzyl derivatives (MC1004, IC50 = 19.21 \u03bcM; MC1104, IC50 = 6.89 \u03bcM; MC1204, IC50 = 5.68 \u03bcM; MC1304, IC50 = 7.06 \u03bcM) displayed similar cytotoxicity to the corresponding benzyl ketone analogues (MC0304-MC0504, MC0704). Interest-ingly, the 4-hydroxybenzyl amide derivative, which showed the highest activity along with N-ethyl 3-indole amide at the C-3 position, completely abolished the cytotoxicity (MC0523 and MC0723, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). Based on these cytotoxicities, compound MC0704 (IC50 = 3.11 \u03bcM) was found to be the most potent analogue among the tested compounds. Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs). The structural modification of MC compounds was mainly focused on the C-3 and C-1 positions of the \u03b2-carboline scaffold, and synthetic derivatives were investigated for their cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells. As a result (Tables 1 and 2), plausible SARs for these MC derivatives were obtained (Figure 3). Generally, C-3 secondary amide derivatives exhibited better activity than those of ester (MC0134, IC50 = 9.52 \u03bcM) analogues, and the carboxylic acid derivative (MC01B, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) showed poor cytotoxicity. These data indicated that the secondary amide bond at the C-3 position is beneficial for increasing the activity. For the substituents on the secondary amide, the aliphatic (MC0105 and MC0106, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM, MC0107, Scheme 1.

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX D IC50 = 37.28 \u03bcM) and phenyl (MC0110-MC0112, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) amides lacked activity against breast cancer cells. However, an additional amine or hydroxy substituent enhanced the cytotoxicity (for aliphatic amide: MC0108, IC50 = 11.34 \u03bcM; MC0109, IC50 = 16.47 \u03bcM/for phenyl amide: MC0113, IC50 = 10.79 \u03bcM; MC0114, IC50 = 6.98 \u03bcM), and the polar group may be favorable for binding to the target protein through hydrogen bonding. This tendency was also found in benzyl amide derivatives (MC0116, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM; MC0122, IC50 = 16.28 \u03bcM; MC0123, IC50 = 3.51 \u03bcM), and the hydroxyl substituent at the para-position of the benzyl group affected the activity more than those of the substituent at the meta-or ortho-position (MC0124, IC50 = 27.69 \u03bcM; MC0125, IC50 = 10.34 \u03bcM). These results indicated that compound MC0123 was the most active C-3 derivative of \u03b2-carboline. In the case of the 3-indole moiety, which belongs to natural marinacarboline D, the length of the carbon chain between the indole ring and amide was considered to be an important factor in cytotoxicity. The ethyl 3-indole amide MC0104 (n = 2, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM) exhibited better activity than the methyl 3-indole amide MC0126 (n = 1, IC50 > 14.26 \u03bcM), and the propyl 3-indole amideMC0127 (n = 3, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) showed significantly lower activity compared to these two derivatives. Additional substituents on the indole group did not greatly affect the cytotoxicity (MC0128-30). In the case of the C-1 ketone moiety on \u03b2-carboline, the length of the carbon chain in aliphatic ketones also affected the cytotoxicity (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM; MC0204, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). In the case of the benzyl ketone unit at C-1, all para substituents on the benzyl group enhanced the cytotoxicity. Among them, MC0704 (IC50 = 3.11 \u03bcM), which harbors a para-bromo benzyl ketone, was the most active compared to compounds with meta-and ortho-bromo substituents. In particular, the C-1 phenyl-substituted derivatives (MC1004-MC1304) also showed cytotoxicity similar to that of benzyl ketone analogues (MC0304-MC0504 and MC0704), suggesting that the C-1 carbonyl group is not necessary for the activity. The combination of the C-3 4-hydroxybenzyl amide derivative MC0123 (IC50 = 3.51 \u03bcM) and the C-1 4-bromobenzoyl derivative MC0704 (IC50 = 3.11 \u03bcM), which showed potent activity at the C-3 and C-1 position, respectively, does not show any synergistic effect and lose cytotoxicity completely (MC0723, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). These results imply that derivatives with 4-hydroxybenzyl amide substitution at C-3 exhibit cytotoxicity through different mechanisms with N-ethyl 3-indole amide-substituted derivatives. The SARs of MC derivatives will be helpful for further optimization based on the \u03b2-carboline structure. In Vitro STAT3 Inhibitory Activity. The STAT3 activity of the synthetic MC derivatives was primarily evaluated using a reporter gene assay in HEK-293 cells (Figure 4B). The JAK2/ STAT3 inhibitor, WP1066, was used as a positive control.

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX F MC compounds with an N-ethyl 3-indole amide at the C-3 position (MC0104, MC0504, MC0704, and MC1304) exhibited higher STAT3 inhibitory activity compared to the other amide-and ester-substituted MC compounds (MC0122, MC0123, and MC0134). MC0123 had a significantly less inhibitory effect on STAT3, as we expected based on SAR studies. Among the MC compounds with N-ethyl 3-indole amide, natural marinacarboline D (MC0104) showed the lowest STAT3 inhibition activity. Therefore, further STAT3 inhibitory activities in breast cancer cells were explored using three MC compounds (MC0504, MC0704, and MC1304). The activation of STAT3 signaling resulting from tyrosine residue phosphorylation (Y705) leads to aberrant oncogene transcription. To further confirm whether the STAT3 inhibitory activity of MC compounds regulates the activation of STAT3 in breast cancer cells, the levels of p-STAT3 (Y705) expression after treatment with the compounds were assessed by western blotting analysis in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line. As depicted in Figure 4C, all three tested compounds effectively suppressed the activation (phosphorylation form) of STAT3. Consistent with the results from the antiprolifera-tion and STAT3 enzymatic activity assays,MC0704, which has a p-bromo-benzyl ketone at the C-1 position and an N-ethyl 3-indole amide at the C-3 position, was the most active in suppressing STAT3 activation in tested TNBC cells. Involvement of STAT3 in Taxane-Resistant TNBC Cells. Acquired drug resistance to anticancer agents is one of the main reasons for unsuccessful treatment. Although taxanoids (paclitaxel and docetaxel) show satisfactory initial access against TNBC, resistance against taxanoids appears after certain periods of treatment. To further clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of taxanoid resistance in TNBC, MDA-MB-231 cell lines resistant to paclitaxel or docetaxel were established by continuous exposure of gradually increasing concentrations of the compound to drug-sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5A). When selected MC compounds were treated in established docetaxel-resistant cells, we could confirm that the compounds exhibited antiproliferative activity similar to that in parental cells (Table 3). As expected,MC0704, which showed the most potent STAT3 inhibitory activity, also showed superior antiproliferative activity against resistant cells. On the other hand, both established paclitaxel-resistant (MDA-MB-231-PTR) and docetaxel-resistant (MDA-MB-231-DTR) cells displayed about 66-and 103-fold resistance to paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively (Table 4). MC0704, however, exerted potent antiproliferative activity with similar IC50 values in the parent and resistant cells, which suggested that MC0704 overcomes the acquired taxane resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells. Because MDA-MB-231-DTR cells displayed more stable resistance than MDA-MB-231-PTR cells, MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were used as a representative taxane-resistant cell line in subsequent experiments. To further confirm whether STAT3 is involved in docetaxel resistance, the levels of p-STAT3 (Y705) expression were analyzed in these cells. Upregulation of p-STAT3 (Y705) was found in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells compared to parental cells, and MC0704 treatment effectively suppressed the activation of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 5B). In addition, MC0704 did not show the effective suppression of the phosphorylation of STAT1 (S727) and STAT5 (Y694), implying the selective regulation of STAT3 activity by MC0704 (Figure S1). The phospho-kinase array was also performed to exclude the possibility of influence on other kinases. As shown in Figure S2, phosphorylation of other targets was not regulated by MC0704 treatment. We further validated the association of STAT3 with acquired docetaxel resistance in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. Knockdown of STAT3 using siRNA restored docetaxel sensitivity against MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 5C,D), while overexpression of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 parental cells decreased docetaxel sensitivity in the cells (Figure 5E,F). These findings indicated the involvement of STAT3 in docetaxel-resistant TNBC cells and the possibility of the restoration of docetaxel sensitivity by the inhibition of STAT3 in resistant cells. By analyzing the CI value using the Chou-Talalay method, we demonstrated that the combination of MC0704 and docetaxel exhibited synergistic effects on the antiproliferation activity of MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 5G). Induction of Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis by MC0704. The cell cycle is finely regulated in mammalian cells, but cancer cells are frequently accelerated by aberrant activation of the cell cycle.25,26 Activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway is intimately involved in aberrant cell cycle progression in human TNBC cells.27 Because the STAT3 signaling pathway was upregulated in docetaxel-resistant TNBC cells, cell cycle analysis was performed to confirm whether the suppression of STAT3 by MC0704 affects cell cycle progression in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. Treatment with MC0704 (10 \u03bcM) for 36 h significantly increased the distribution of cells in the G2/M phase from 13.16% (vehicle-treated control) to 29.72% in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 6A,B). The G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by Figure 3. General structure-activity relationships for target MC derivatives. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX G MC0704 was also confirmed by the upregulation of cell cycle checkpoint proteins as well as the downregulation of c-Myc and Cdc25C (Figure 6C). Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway upregulates antiapoptotic proteins, thereby blocking apoptotic cell death in cancer cells.28 To further explore whether more prolonged exposure to MC0704 induces apoptotic cell death, MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were treated with MC0704 (5 \u03bcM) for an extended time period (48 h). As depicted in Figure 7A,B, G2/ M cell cycle arrest was predominant for up to 36 h, but the ratio of sub-G1 cells was significantly increased at 48 h, indicating that MC0704 may induce cell cycle arrest and then sequentially induce apoptosis after prolonged treatment of MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. The induction of apoptosis was also confirmed by flow cytometric analysis after double staining MDA-MB-231-DTR cells with Annexin V-fluorescein iso-thiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI). MC0704 increased total cell death by 5.55, 18.79, and 61.85% at concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10 \u03bcM, respectively, in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 7C-E). In addition, western blot analysis revealed that the apoptosis induction was linked with apoptosis-associated protein expressions. In MDA-MB-231-Figure 4. Effects of MC compounds on STAT3 activity.

XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX I DTR cells, the expression levels of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 were upregulated, and the antiapoptotic biomarkers, Bcl2 and survivin, were downregulated (Figure 7F). MC0704 Inhibits Cell Invasion and Migration through Modulating STAT3-Mediated EMT Biomarker Expres-sion. Metastasis is a unique process that increases the aggressiveness of cancer cells, and it occurs concurrently with a series of cellular events, involving cell invasion and migration, by accelerating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).29 Many downstream target genes of STAT3 are associated with cancer metastasis. Therefore, STAT3 is considered a potential target for the management of cancer cell metastasis.30 Because phosphorylation of STAT3 was upregulated in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells compared to parental MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5B), cell migration and invasion potential were evaluated after treatment with MC0704 in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. Compared to MDA-MB-231 cells, the cell invasion and migration were enhanced in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells, and these events were effectively regulated by MC0704 treatment in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 8A,B). The inhibition of cell migration and invasion by MC0704 in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells was also linked with the expression of STAT3-mediated downstream EMT biomarkers as follows: downregulation of epithelial biomarkers, including Snail, N-cadherin, and vimentin; and upregulation of E-cadherin, a mesenchymal biomarker (Figure 8C). These data suggested that the enhanced metastasis of the docetaxel-resistant cells is accompanied by the activation of the STAT3-mediated EMT process and that MC0704 has the potential to effectively inhibit the metastasis of the acquired resistant cells by suppressing the activation of STAT3-mediated downstream signaling pathways in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. Antitumor Activity of MC0704 in Nude Mouse Xenograft Models Implanted with MDA-MB-231-DTR Cells. The in vivo antitumor activity ofMC0704 was evaluated in MDA-MB-231-DTR cell-implanted nude mouse xenograft models. When the tumor volume reached about 100 mm3, vehicle (DMSO/cremophor/normal saline = 10:10:80), docetaxel (5 mg/kg body weight), paclitaxel (5 mg/kg body weight), MC0704 (10 mg/kg body weight), or a combination of docetaxel (5 mg/kg body weight) and MC0704 (10 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally treated daily for 12 days. Tumor volume and body weight change were measured every 2 days during the experiments. Previous studies have reported that docetaxel or paclitaxel effectively inhibits tumor growth in an MDA-MB-231 cell-implanted mouse model.31,32 In the present study, however, the antitumor activity of docetaxel and paclitaxel was negligible in MDA-MB-231-DTR cell-implanted models. These data suggested that the acquired resistance to docetaxel was still maintained during tumor formation and that cross-resistance occurred for paclitaxel, a taxane-type com-pound. Treatment with MC0704 (10 mg/kg), however, significantly inhibited tumor growth without any overt toxicity (Figure 9A). Tumor weight on the last day of the experiments was also diminished by MC0704 treatment. In addition, consistent with the in vitro combination effect on antiprolifera-tion, the combination treatment of docetaxel and MC0704 exhibited significantly enhanced antitumor activity (tumor volume and tumor weight) compared to the administration of either docetaxel or MC704 alone (Figure 9A-C). Further-more, immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues revealed that p-STAT3 (activated-STAT3), Ki-67 (a well-known proliferation marker), and vimentin (a mesenchymal marker) was considerably upregulated but that the expression of E-cadherin (an epithelial marker) was downregulated in the resistant MDA-MB-231-DTR cell-implanted tumor tissues compared to the parental MDA-MB-231 cell-implanted tumor tissues. The expression of these biomarker proteins was effectively reversed by MC0704 treatment in MDA-MB-231-DTR cell-implanted tumor tissues (Figure 9D). Molecular Docking Study of MC0704. To understand the potential interactions of MC0704 with STAT3, docking simulations were conducted using the published crystal structure of STAT3 (PDB: 6NJS). As demonstrated in Figure 10, the bromophenyl group sits in a shallow cleft between Ser636 and Pro639, whereas N-ethyl 3-indole amide moiety lies along a cleft formed by Tyr640, Gln644, and Glu638. MC0704 forms several hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Tyr657, Gln644, and Glu638. The carbonyl group attached to \u03b2-carboline has a hydrogen bonding interaction with the -OH group of Tyr657. In addition, the nitrogen atom of indole and the side chain carbonyl group of Gln644 forms a hydrogen bond, whereas the nitrogen atom of pyridine in \u03b2-carboline has a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide nitrogen of Glu638. MC0704 is also stabilized by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacked interaction between the indole moiety and the phenyl group of Tyr640. An additional amide-\u03c0 stacked interaction is observed between the para-bromophenyl group and the amide bond formed between Val637 and Glu638. Meanwhile, the -Br group contributes to a hydrophobic interaction with the methylene group of Pro639. Target Validation of MC0704 by Pull-Down Experi-ment Using Biotinylated Derivatives. We subsequently assessed the target specificity of MC0704 using pull-down target engagement experiment. Compound 5 was prepared by introducing biotin on MC0704 which showed the strongest inhibitory effect on STAT3 (Figure 11A). From 5-hydroxy-Table 3.

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX J tryptophan methyl ester as a starting material, \u03b2-carboline compound 1 was synthesized through oxidative annulation with 4\u2032-bromoacetophenone. After propargylation of hydroxyl group, ethyl ester in compound 2 was hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid under basic condition. The N-ethyl 3-indole amide moiety was introduced by amide coupling with tryptamine. Finally, the biotinylated MC0704 (compound 5) was synthesized via a click reaction between propargyl group and the azide linker of biotin. Biotin compound 7, used as a negative control for accurate comparison, was also prepared by a similar synthetic process from simple phenol. To evaluate the STAT3 engagement of MC0704 in cells, newly synthesized com-pounds were subjected to streptavidin/biotin pull-down assay in cell lysates derived from MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. Compared to the negative control compound (compound 7), 20 \u03bcM of biotinylated MC0704 (compound 5) effectively engages STAT3 in cell lysates within 1 h, indicating that STAT3 is indeed a target of MC0704. CONCLUSIONS In summary, the novel synthetic STAT3 pathway inhibitor, MC0704, which is a \u03b2-carboline compound containing a p-bromo-benzyl ketone at the C-1 position and an N-ethyl 3-indole amide at the C-3 position, exhibited potential antitumor activity in acquired docetaxel-resistant TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Notably, MC0704 effectively downregulated STAT3 pathway in the MDA-MB-231-DTR cell line. MC0704 also inhibited the invasiveness and migration of TNBC cells in vitro and suppressed the STAT3-mediated EMT process. In acquired resistant TNBC cells inoculated mouse model, MC0704 effectively suppressed tumor growth by regulating STAT3 activity and EMT biomarkers. Figure 6.

MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were transfected with 10 nM siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells transfected with a control nonspecific siRNA duplex were used as controls for direct comparison. Cell Viability Assay (MTT Assay). Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates. On the next day, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of test compounds and incubated for 72 h.36 IC50 values were calculated through nonlinear regression analysis using TableCurve 2D v5.01 software (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). The combination effect was evaluated through a combination index (CI) value, which was calculated as follows: CI = D1/(Dx)1 + D2/(Dx)2, where D1 and D2 are concentrations of the combined test compounds that achieve the expected effect, and (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 are concentrations that achieve similar effects when test compounds are used alone. The CI values were compared with reference values according to the Chou-Talalay method.8 Plasmid Transfection. TurboFectin Transfection Reagent (#TF81001; Origene, Rockville, MD) was used to transfect parental MDA-MB-231 cells with pCMV6-STAT3 (#RC215836; Origene) or pCMV6-Entry control vector (#PS100001; Origine). All transfection procedures were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 48 h, transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested for protein isolation. Cell Cycle Analysis. Cell cycle dynamics were measured using flow cytometry. MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h for synchronization. After synchronization, the cells were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or MC0704 for the indicated times in complete medium. After incubation, all adherent and floating cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, and subsequently fixed in 70% cold ethanol overnight at -20 \u00b0C. The fixed cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 100 \u03bcg/mL RNase A in a shaker for 30 min. Cells were then stained with 50 \u03bcg/ mL PI in the dark. The fluorescence-activated cells were then sorted, and the cellular DNA content was analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur flow cytometer; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data were calculated using CellQuest 3.0.1 software (BD Biosciences), and the distributions of cells in each phase of the cell cycle are displayed as histograms.37 Apoptosis Detection Assay (Annexin V-Fluorescein Iso-thiocyanate and PI Double Staining). MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were treated with MC0704 for 48 h in complete medium and then stained with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC) and PI using the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Briefly, the incubated cells were harvested, washed twice in cold PBS, resuspended in 1\u00d7 binding buffer, and treated with Annexin V-FITC and PI in the dark for 15 min. The stained cells were resuspended in 1\u00d7 binding buffer and immediately analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur flow cytometer; BD Biosciences). Transwell Cell Invasion Assay. In brief, 24-well Transwell membrane inserts (diameter, 6.5 mm; pore size, 8 \u03bcm; Corning, Tewksbury, MA) were coated with 10 \u03bcL of type I collagen (0.5 mg/ mL, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and 20 \u03bcL of a 1:20 mixture of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in PBS. After treatment with MC0704 for 24 h, MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells (parent or docetaxel-resistant) were harvested, resuspended in serum-free medium, and plated (3 \u00d7 105 cells/chamber) in the upper chamber of the Matrigel-coated Transwell insert. Medium containing 30% FBS was used as the chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After 24 h of incubation, cells that had invaded the outer surfaces of the lower chambers were fixed and stained using the Diff-Quik Staining Kit (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) and imaged using the Vectra 3.0 Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Representative images from three separate experiments were evaluated, and the number of invasive cells was semiquantified using ImageJ 1.52a software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cell Migration Assay (Wound-Healing Assay). MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells (parent or docetaxel-resistant) were grown to 90% confluence in a six-well plate. Subsequently, the cell monolayer was artificially wounded using the SPL Scar Scratcher (SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon, Republic of Korea), and detached cells were removed after washing with PBS. Wounded cell cultures were then incubated with media containing 1% FBS and various concentrations ofMC0704 for 24 h. Wounds were photographed at 0 and 24 h under an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Wound areas were quantified using ImageJ 1.52a software and presented as percent cell migration (%) relative to the wound area at 0 h. In Vivo Tumor Xenograft Model. All animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines approved by the Seoul National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; permission number: SNU-210525-1). Female nude mice (BALB/c-nu, aged 5-6 weeks, and weighing 18 g) were purchased from Orient Bio, Inc. (Seongnam, Korea) and housed under pathogen-free conditions with a 12 h light-dark schedule. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of mice (4 \u00d7 106 cells in 200 \u03bcL of PBS), and tumors were allowed to grow for 10 days until the tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm3. The mice were randomized into vehicle control and treatment groups (n = 6). Vehicle control (DMSO/ cremophor/normal saline = 10:10:80), docetaxel (5 mg/kg body weight), paclitaxel (5 mg/kg body weight),MC0704 (10 mg/kg body weight), or a combination of docetaxel (5 mg/kg body weight) and MC0704 (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 12 days, and mice were euthanized 3 days later. Tumors were excised, weighed, and frozen for biochemical analysis. Tumor volume was measured using an electronic caliper according to the following formula: tumor volume (mm3) = 3.14 \u00d7 length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height/6. Toxicity was evaluated based on body weight loss. Ex Vivo Immunohistochemical Analysis. Tumor tissues fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX X MO) were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, mounted onto slides, deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated with an ethanol series, and subjected to antigen retrieval. The slides were incubated with the indicated antibodies, which were detected using the LSAB2 System-HRP kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Stained sections were observed and imaged using the Vectra 3.0 Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Molecular Docking Analysis. The molecular docking simu-lations of MC0704 were performed using Schrodinger Maestro 12.8 (Schrodinger, Inc., New York, NY). The X-ray cocrystal structure of STAT3 was downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 6NJS) and prepared with the Protein Preparation Wizard model including the addition of missing hydrogen atoms, the assignment of bond order, assessment of the accurate proton states, and a restrained minimization using the OPLS4 force field. The receptor grid was generated around the original ligand with a grid box size set to 15 \u00c5. Docking runs were performed through standard precision (SP) mode with the flexible ligand and default settings. Molecular interactions between protein and ligand were further analyzed using Discovery Studio 2017 Visualizer (BIOVIA, San Diego, CA). Streptavidin Biotin Pull-Down Assay. MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed with IP lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The whole cell lysates were incubated with 20 \u03bcM of compound 5 or compound 7 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Lysates were then incubated with streptavidin beads (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with 400 \u03bcL of PBS and boiled for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in 50 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) + 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were subjected to western blotting analysis to evaluate engaged STAT3 levels. Statistical Analysis. Data are presented as the mean values \u00b1 standard deviations (SD) for the indicated number of independently performed experiments. Statistical significance (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001) was evaluated using Student\u2019s t test or one-way analysis of variance coupled with Dunnett\u2019s t test.

    "abstract": "Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is afatal type of breast cancer (BC), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has emerged as an effective target for mTNBC. In the present study, compound MC0704 was found to be a novel synthetic STAT3 pathway inhibitor, and its potential antitumor activity was demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo models in docetaxel-resistant TNBC cells. Based on marinacarboline (MC), a series \u03b2-carboline derivatives were synthesized and investigated for their antitumor activities against docetaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 (MDA-MB-231-DTR) cells. Combining antiproliferation and STAT3 inhibitory activities, MC0704 was selected as the most promising \u03b2-carboline compound. MC0704 effectively impeded the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231-DTR cells in vitro, and the combination of MC0704 and docetaxel exhibited potent antitumor activities in a xenograft mouse model. These findings suggested that MC0704 can be a lead candidate as a target therapeutic agent for TNBC patients with docetaxel resistance.",
    "introduction": [
        "Cancer is still one of the leading causes of human death worldwide.1 Three solid cancers, including lung, breast, and colon cancers, are more prevalent among all malignancies.2 In particular, breast cancer (BC) is one of the main causes of cancer-associated death in women due to its high recurrence and/or metastatic potential. Although several strategies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, are frequently applied for the management of BC, chemo-therapy remains the most basic treatment strategy.3,4 There-fore, the discovery of novel molecules targeting a potential mechanism is considered an essential direction in the development of small-molecule-based anticancer drugs. BC is typically categorized into respective subtypes based on the presence of representative receptors (the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor).5 Hence, these surface receptors are promising therapeutic targets for drug development against breast cancers (BCs). However, about 20% of BC does not express all of these three receptors and is classified as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).6 Due to a lack of particular therapeutic targets and an increased metastatic potential, TNBC patients usually show a relatively worse clinical outcome than patients with other BC subtypes.7 In the clinic, taxane-based cytotoxic anticancer agents, such as paclitaxel or docetaxel, have been used to treat TNBC, and these drugs have been reported to be the most effective. However, there is no other option when resistance occurs after long-term treatment.8 Therefore, the development of a novel agent with a promising molecular mechanism is urgently needed. Both extrinsic and intrinsic signals activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family by phosphorylation on a conserved tyrosine residue. STAT3, a STAT family member, is activated by various cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes, and it is constitutively active in a high percentage of cancers and cancer-derived cell lines, including TNBC cells. A body of evidence suggests that STAT3 governs cancer progression, antiapoptosis, invasion, migration, and acquired drug resistance by participating in several intrinsic signaling pathways.9-11 In addition, our previous studies revealed that STAT3 inhibitors effectively regulate the growth of TNBC.5,8 Therefore, the development of an effective compound that modulates STAT3 is considered to be an effective treatment for TNBC.

        "Natural products have been an abundant source of compounds for drug discovery, and many anticancer drugs currently used in clinical treatments originate from natural product scaffolds, such as vinblastine and paclitaxel.12 Among these natural products, \u03b2-carbolines, a class of indole alkaloids, contain the specific tricyclic pyrido-[3,4-b] indole ring, which belongs to an important moiety of bioactive natural products found in nature (Figure 1). \u03b2-Carboline alkaloids, such as harmine, pityriacitrin, and marinacarboline (MC), have been reported to display antiproliferative activity against many cancer cell lines.13-17 Marinacarboline, a marine \u03b2-carboline alkaloid bearing an acetyl group attached at the C-1 position and an amide group attached at the C-3 position, is of particular interest due to its unique structure and intriguing biological profile. Marinacarbolines A-D were first isolated from Marinactinospora thermotolerans in 2011 and evaluated for their antimalarial activities.18 Subsequently, several research groups have made efforts to synthesize marinacarboline and its derivatives, and their potential anticancer activities have also been investigated.19,20 Recently, additional alkaloids, namely, marinacarbolines E-Q, have been isolated from the actino-mycete Actinoalloteichus sp. ZZ1866, and these compounds also exhibit antiproliferative activities against several cancer cell lines.21 However, the low production yields of these natural compounds by cultivation limit further study on exploring biological applications. These factors have prompted our group to investigate efficient synthetic methods for these \u03b2-carboline compounds. Therefore, as part of our ongoing effort for anticancer therapeutics development, we report herein the molecular design, efficient synthetic methods, and biological assessment of \u03b2-carboline compounds derived from natural marinacarbolines.",
        "Previous findings15,22,23 have suggested that the substituents at positions 1 and 3 of \u03b2-carboline play an important role in antiproliferation activity against cancer cells. In the present study, the marinacarboline scaffold was used as a key unit, and various substitutions were planned to provide both C-1 ketone and C-3 amide groups based on the core \u03b2-carboline structure as depicted in Figure 2. Therefore, a series of novel \u03b2-carboline derivatives were designed and synthesized, and their cytotoxic activities against a TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) were evaluated for their structure-activity relationships (SARs). Biological investigations of novel marinacarboline analogues for STAT3 activity were also summarized and discussed."
    ],
    "results and discussion": [
        "Chemistry. First, a series of \u03b2-carboline derivatives based on natural marinacarbolines were synthesized by introducing various amide functional groups on the 3-position \u03b2-carboline pharmacophore (Scheme 1). L-Tryptophan methyl ester was selected as a starting material and was transformed into \u03b2-carboline MC01A via oxidative annulation with acetone.24 Acetone was converted to 2-oxoaldehydes in situ by iodine and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and Pictet-Spengler-type ring closure occurred. The methyl ester in MC01A was conveniently hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid MC01B in the presence of sodium hydroxide solution in methanol. With the carboxylic acid MC01B in hand, amide coupling with various amines afforded the \u03b2-carboline derivatives MC0101-MC0133 using hexafluorophosphate benzotriazole tetramethyl uronium (HBTU) as a coupling agent. The structures of the synthesized compounds are displayed with cytotoxic activities in Table 1. The ester-type derivative MC0134 was also synthesized through the same protocol using tryptophol instead of amine.",
        "Next, our synthetic focus was changed to diversify the substituent on the C-1 position of the \u03b2-carboline scaffold. At the C-3 position, we planned to introduce mainly an N-ethyl 3-indole amide, similar to marinacarboline D, which is the most potent natural marinacarboline. According to a previous synthetic method, various ketone groups were introduced at the C-1 position to synthesize the \u03b2-carboline derivatives MC0204-MC0904 (Scheme 2). Furthermore, MC0523-and MC0723-substituted 4-hydroxybenzyl amide group at the C-3 position were synthesized through amide coupling with 4-hydroxybenzyl amine. The C-1 phenyl-substituted derivatives MC1004-MC1304 were also synthesized using benzaldehyde instead of a ketone in oxidative Pictet-Spengler condensation. The chemical structures of the C-1-diversified \u03b2-carboline derivatives are shown with cytotoxic activities in Table 2. The purities of all synthetic compounds were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to be >95.0%. Detailed synthetic procedure and characterization of these compounds are described in the Experimental Section.",
        "Cytotoxicity. All prepared marinacarboline (MC) deriva-tives and marinacaboline A-D were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and MRC-5 (normal lung fibroblast) cells by the SRB assay, and the results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

        "As a result, the substituent structures of the C-3 position on MC0101-MC0134 and their IC50 values for cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells are displayed in Table 1. Among the natural marinacarbolines, marinacarboline D (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity, and the data were consistent with previous findings.20 Methyl ester and carboxylic acid intermediates (MC01A-B, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) did not exhibit cytotoxic activity, and the ester derivative (MC0134, IC50 = 9.52 \u03bcM) also showed relatively lower inhibition activities compared to its amide analogue, marinacarboline D. Focusing on substituents of amide and aliphatic groups provided poor cytotoxicity (MC0105-06, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM; MC0107, IC50 = 37.28 \u03bcM); however, an amine or hydroxyl group attached to the aliphatic chain slightly improved cytotoxicity (MC0108, IC50 = 11.34 \u03bcM; MC0109, IC50 = 16.47 \u03bcM). Although phenyl groups were also poor substituents for cytotoxicity (MC0110-12, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM), the introduction of an amine at the para-position increased the activity (MC0113, IC50 = 10.79 \u03bcM). The 5-indole group was also found to be a good substituent for cytotoxicity (MC0114, IC50 = 6.98 \u03bcM), but the insertion of a carbon between the amide nitrogen and the 5-carbon of indole slightly decreased the activity (MC0115, IC50 = 14.88 \u03bcM). Although a simple benzyl substituent was less effective (MC0116, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM), the additional substituents at the para-position also affected the cytotoxicity (MC0117-23). In particular, the introduction of a hydroxy group at the benzyl substituent showed strong cytotoxicity (MC0122, IC50 = 16.28 \u03bcM; MC0123, IC50 = 3.51 \u03bcM). It is interesting to note that the meta-positioned hydroxy group exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the para-and ortho-positioned hydroxy groups (MC0124, IC50 = 27.69 \u03bcM; MC0125, IC50 = 10.34 \u03bcM). Based on the amide substituent of marinacarboline D, two carbon lengths between the amide nitrogen and 3-carbon of indole were effective for cytotoxicity (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM; MC0126, IC50 = 14.26 \u03bcM; MC0127, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). Additional substitutions of indole did not show a significant improvement in cytotoxicity (MC0128, IC50 = 5.94 \u03bcM; MC0129, IC50 = 10.84 \u03bcM; MC0130, IC50 > 11.28 \u03bcM). All tertiary amide derivatives (MC0131 and MC0132, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM; MC0133, IC50 = 20.80 \u03bcM) tended to decrease the cytotoxicity. Moreover, all of the active compounds also showed relatively selective cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells compared to normal lung fibroblast cells.",
        "In addition, MC derivatives at the C-1 position of \u03b2-carboline were also investigated for cytotoxicity using the same cell line (Table 2). In the case of the ketone group at the C-1 position of \u03b2-carboline, simple elongation of the carbon chain from methyl to n-propyl provided diminished cytotoxicity (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM; MC0204, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). When benzyl ketone was applied at the C-1 position (MC0304, IC50 = 21.25 \u03bcM), it was less effective than the acetyl derivative. However, an additional substituent at the para-position of the benzyl group significantly increased the cytotoxicity (MC0404, IC50 = 8.29 \u03bcM; MC0504, IC50 = 6.82 \u03bcM; MC0604, IC50 = 14.69 \u03bcM; MC0704, IC50 = 3.11 \u03bcM). Notably, compound MC0704 (p-bromo-benzyl ketone derivative) exhibited significant cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells, and it was more potent than the natural marinacarboline D (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM). Interestingly, only para-substituted benzyl ketone analogues were effective compared to meta-and ortho-substituted derivatives (MC0804-MC0904, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). To investigate the cytotoxic effects of the carbonyl group at the C-1 position, prepared benzyl analogues were also tested for cytotoxicity using the same cell line. Although the C-1 benzyl derivatives (MC1004, IC50 = 19.21 \u03bcM; MC1104, IC50 = 6.89 \u03bcM; MC1204, IC50 = 5.68 \u03bcM; MC1304, IC50 = 7.06 \u03bcM) displayed similar cytotoxicity to the corresponding benzyl ketone analogues (MC0304-MC0504, MC0704). Interest-ingly, the 4-hydroxybenzyl amide derivative, which showed the highest activity along with N-ethyl 3-indole amide at the C-3 position, completely abolished the cytotoxicity (MC0523 and MC0723, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). Based on these cytotoxicities, compound MC0704 (IC50 = 3.11 \u03bcM) was found to be the most potent analogue among the tested compounds.",
        "Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs). The structural modification of MC compounds was mainly focused on the C-3 and C-1 positions of the \u03b2-carboline scaffold, and synthetic derivatives were investigated for their cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells. As a result (Tables 1 and 2), plausible SARs for these MC derivatives were obtained (Figure 3). Generally, C-3 secondary amide derivatives exhibited better activity than those of ester (MC0134, IC50 = 9.52 \u03bcM) analogues, and the carboxylic acid derivative (MC01B, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) showed poor cytotoxicity. These data indicated that the secondary amide bond at the C-3 position is beneficial for increasing the activity. For the substituents on the secondary amide, the aliphatic (MC0105 and MC0106, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM, MC0107, Scheme 1. Synthesis of 1-Acetyl Marinacarboline Derivatives MC0101-MC0134a aReagents and conditions: (a) acetone, I2, DMSO, 90 \u00b0C, 3 h, 78%; (b) NaOH, MeOH, 60 \u00b0C, 3 h, 91%; (c) HBTU, corresponding amine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), dimethylformamide (DMF), 25 \u00b0C, 2.5 h, 11-87%; (d) HBTU, tryptophol, DIPEA, DMF, 25 \u00b0C, 2.5 h, 48%.

XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX D IC50 = 37.28 \u03bcM) and phenyl (MC0110-MC0112, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) amides lacked activity against breast cancer cells. However, an additional amine or hydroxy substituent enhanced the cytotoxicity (for aliphatic amide: MC0108, IC50 = 11.34 \u03bcM; MC0109, IC50 = 16.47 \u03bcM/for phenyl amide: MC0113, IC50 = 10.79 \u03bcM; MC0114, IC50 = 6.98 \u03bcM), and the polar group may be favorable for binding to the target protein through hydrogen bonding. This tendency was also found in benzyl amide derivatives (MC0116, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM; MC0122, IC50 = 16.28 \u03bcM; MC0123, IC50 = 3.51 \u03bcM), and the hydroxyl substituent at the para-position of the benzyl group affected the activity more than those of the substituent at the meta-or ortho-position (MC0124, IC50 = 27.69 \u03bcM; MC0125, IC50 = 10.34 \u03bcM). These results indicated that compound MC0123 was the most active C-3 derivative of \u03b2-carboline. In the case of the 3-indole moiety, which belongs to natural marinacarboline D, the length of the carbon chain between the indole ring and amide was considered to be an important factor in cytotoxicity. The ethyl 3-indole amide MC0104 (n = 2, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM) exhibited better activity than the methyl 3-indole amide MC0126 (n = 1, IC50 > 14.26 \u03bcM), and the propyl 3-indole amideMC0127 (n = 3, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) showed significantly lower activity compared to these two derivatives. Additional substituents on the indole group did not greatly affect the cytotoxicity (MC0128-30). In the case of the C-1 ketone moiety on \u03b2-carboline, the length of the carbon chain in aliphatic ketones also affected the cytotoxicity (MC0104, IC50 = 7.71 \u03bcM; MC0204, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). In the case of the benzyl ketone unit at C-1, all para substituents on the benzyl group enhanced the cytotoxicity. Among them, MC0704 (IC50 = 3.11 \u03bcM), which harbors a para-bromo benzyl ketone, was the most active compared to compounds with meta-and ortho-bromo substituents. In particular, the C-1 phenyl-substituted derivatives (MC1004-MC1304) also showed cytotoxicity similar to that of benzyl ketone analogues (MC0304-MC0504 and MC0704), suggesting that the C-1 carbonyl group is not necessary for the activity. The combination of the C-3 4-hydroxybenzyl amide derivative MC0123 (IC50 = 3.51 \u03bcM) and the C-1 4-bromobenzoyl derivative MC0704 (IC50 = 3.11 \u03bcM), which showed potent activity at the C-3 and C-1 position, respectively, does not show any synergistic effect and lose cytotoxicity completely (MC0723, IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). These results imply that derivatives with 4-hydroxybenzyl amide substitution at C-3 exhibit cytotoxicity through different mechanisms with N-ethyl 3-indole amide-substituted derivatives. The SARs of MC derivatives will be helpful for further optimization based on the \u03b2-carboline structure.",

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX F MC compounds with an N-ethyl 3-indole amide at the C-3 position (MC0104, MC0504, MC0704, and MC1304) exhibited higher STAT3 inhibitory activity compared to the other amide-and ester-substituted MC compounds (MC0122, MC0123, and MC0134). MC0123 had a significantly less inhibitory effect on STAT3, as we expected based on SAR studies. Among the MC compounds with N-ethyl 3-indole amide, natural marinacarboline D (MC0104) showed the lowest STAT3 inhibition activity. Therefore, further STAT3 inhibitory activities in breast cancer cells were explored using three MC compounds (MC0504, MC0704, and MC1304).",
        "The activation of STAT3 signaling resulting from tyrosine residue phosphorylation (Y705) leads to aberrant oncogene transcription. To further confirm whether the STAT3 inhibitory activity of MC compounds regulates the activation of STAT3 in breast cancer cells, the levels of p-STAT3 (Y705) expression after treatment with the compounds were assessed by western blotting analysis in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line. As depicted in Figure 4C, all three tested compounds effectively suppressed the activation (phosphorylation form) of STAT3. Consistent with the results from the antiprolifera-tion and STAT3 enzymatic activity assays,MC0704, which has a p-bromo-benzyl ketone at the C-1 position and an N-ethyl 3-indole amide at the C-3 position, was the most active in suppressing STAT3 activation in tested TNBC cells.",
        "Involvement of STAT3 in Taxane-Resistant TNBC Cells. Acquired drug resistance to anticancer agents is one of the main reasons for unsuccessful treatment. Although taxanoids (paclitaxel and docetaxel) show satisfactory initial access against TNBC, resistance against taxanoids appears after certain periods of treatment. To further clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of taxanoid resistance in TNBC, MDA-MB-231 cell lines resistant to paclitaxel or docetaxel were established by continuous exposure of gradually increasing concentrations of the compound to drug-sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5A).",
        "When selected MC compounds were treated in established docetaxel-resistant cells, we could confirm that the compounds exhibited antiproliferative activity similar to that in parental cells (Table 3). As expected,MC0704, which showed the most potent STAT3 inhibitory activity, also showed superior antiproliferative activity against resistant cells. On the other hand, both established paclitaxel-resistant (MDA-MB-231-PTR) and docetaxel-resistant (MDA-MB-231-DTR) cells displayed about 66-and 103-fold resistance to paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively (Table 4). MC0704, however, exerted potent antiproliferative activity with similar IC50 values in the parent and resistant cells, which suggested that MC0704 overcomes the acquired taxane resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells. Because MDA-MB-231-DTR cells displayed more stable resistance than MDA-MB-231-PTR cells, MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were used as a representative taxane-resistant cell line in subsequent experiments. To further confirm whether STAT3 is involved in docetaxel resistance, the levels of p-STAT3 (Y705) expression were analyzed in these cells. Upregulation of p-STAT3 (Y705) was found in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells compared to parental cells, and MC0704 treatment effectively suppressed the activation of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 5B). In addition, MC0704 did not show the effective suppression of the phosphorylation of STAT1 (S727) and STAT5 (Y694), implying the selective regulation of STAT3 activity by MC0704 (Figure S1). The phospho-kinase array was also performed to exclude the possibility of influence on other kinases. As shown in Figure S2, phosphorylation of other targets was not regulated by MC0704 treatment.",
        "We further validated the association of STAT3 with acquired docetaxel resistance in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. Knockdown of STAT3 using siRNA restored docetaxel sensitivity against MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 5C,D), while overexpression of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 parental cells decreased docetaxel sensitivity in the cells (Figure 5E,F). These findings indicated the involvement of STAT3 in docetaxel-resistant TNBC cells and the possibility of the restoration of docetaxel sensitivity by the inhibition of STAT3 in resistant cells. By analyzing the CI value using the Chou-Talalay method, we demonstrated that the combination of MC0704 and docetaxel exhibited synergistic effects on the antiproliferation activity of MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 5G).",
        "Induction of Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis by MC0704. The cell cycle is finely regulated in mammalian cells, but cancer cells are frequently accelerated by aberrant activation of the cell cycle.25,26 Activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway is intimately involved in aberrant cell cycle progression in human TNBC cells.27 Because the STAT3 signaling pathway was upregulated in docetaxel-resistant TNBC cells, cell cycle analysis was performed to confirm whether the suppression of STAT3 by MC0704 affects cell cycle progression in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. Treatment with MC0704 (10 \u03bcM) for 36 h significantly increased the distribution of cells in the G2/M phase from 13.16% (vehicle-treated control) to 29.72% in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 6A,B). The G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by Figure 3. General structure-activity relationships for target MC derivatives. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX G MC0704 was also confirmed by the upregulation of cell cycle checkpoint proteins as well as the downregulation of c-Myc and Cdc25C (Figure 6C). Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway upregulates antiapoptotic proteins, thereby blocking apoptotic cell death in cancer cells.28 To further explore whether more prolonged exposure to MC0704 induces apoptotic cell death, MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were treated with MC0704 (5 \u03bcM) for an extended time period (48 h). As depicted in Figure 7A,B, G2/ M cell cycle arrest was predominant for up to 36 h, but the ratio of sub-G1 cells was significantly increased at 48 h, indicating that MC0704 may induce cell cycle arrest and then sequentially induce apoptosis after prolonged treatment of MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. The induction of apoptosis was also confirmed by flow cytometric analysis after double staining MDA-MB-231-DTR cells with Annexin V-fluorescein iso-thiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI). MC0704 increased total cell death by 5.55, 18.79, and 61.85% at concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10 \u03bcM, respectively, in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells (Figure 7C-E). In addition, western blot analysis revealed that the apoptosis induction was linked with apoptosis-associated protein expressions. In MDA-MB-231-Figure 4. Effects of MC compounds on STAT3 activity.

        "MC0704 Inhibits Cell Invasion and Migration through Modulating STAT3-Mediated EMT Biomarker Expres-sion. Metastasis is a unique process that increases the aggressiveness of cancer cells, and it occurs concurrently with a series of cellular events, involving cell invasion and migration, by accelerating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).29 Many downstream target genes of STAT3 are associated with cancer metastasis. Therefore, STAT3 is considered a potential target for the management of cancer cell metastasis.30 Because phosphorylation of STAT3 was upregulated in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells compared to parental MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5B), cell migration and invasion potential were evaluated after treatment with MC0704 in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells. Compared to MDA-MB-231 cells, the cell invasion and migration were enhanced in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells, and these events were effectively regulated by MC0704 treatment in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 8A,B). The inhibition of cell migration and invasion by MC0704 in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells was also linked with the expression of STAT3-mediated downstream EMT biomarkers as follows: downregulation of epithelial biomarkers, including Snail, N-cadherin, and vimentin; and upregulation of E-cadherin, a mesenchymal biomarker (Figure 8C). These data suggested that the enhanced metastasis of the docetaxel-resistant cells is accompanied by the activation of the STAT3-mediated EMT process and that MC0704 has the potential to effectively inhibit the metastasis of the acquired resistant cells by suppressing the activation of STAT3-mediated downstream signaling pathways in MDA-MB-231-DTR cells.",
        "Antitumor Activity of MC0704 in Nude Mouse Xenograft Models Implanted with MDA-MB-231-DTR Cells. The in vivo antitumor activity ofMC0704 was evaluated in MDA-MB-231-DTR cell-implanted nude mouse xenograft models. When the tumor volume reached about 100 mm3, vehicle (DMSO/cremophor/normal saline = 10:10:80), docetaxel (5 mg/kg body weight), paclitaxel (5 mg/kg body weight), MC0704 (10 mg/kg body weight), or a combination of docetaxel (5 mg/kg body weight) and MC0704 (10 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally treated daily for 12 days. Tumor volume and body weight change were measured every 2 days during the experiments. Previous studies have reported that docetaxel or paclitaxel effectively inhibits tumor growth in an MDA-MB-231 cell-implanted mouse model.31,32 In the present study, however, the antitumor activity of docetaxel and paclitaxel was negligible in MDA-MB-231-DTR cell-implanted models. These data suggested that the acquired resistance to docetaxel was still maintained during tumor formation and that cross-resistance occurred for paclitaxel, a taxane-type com-pound. Treatment with MC0704 (10 mg/kg), however, significantly inhibited tumor growth without any overt toxicity (Figure 9A). Tumor weight on the last day of the experiments was also diminished by MC0704 treatment. In addition, consistent with the in vitro combination effect on antiprolifera-tion, the combination treatment of docetaxel and MC0704 exhibited significantly enhanced antitumor activity (tumor volume and tumor weight) compared to the administration of either docetaxel or MC704 alone (Figure 9A-C). Further-more, immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues revealed that p-STAT3 (activated-STAT3), Ki-67 (a well-known proliferation marker), and vimentin (a mesenchymal marker) was considerably upregulated but that the expression of E-cadherin (an epithelial marker) was downregulated in the resistant MDA-MB-231-DTR cell-implanted tumor tissues compared to the parental MDA-MB-231 cell-implanted tumor tissues. The expression of these biomarker proteins was effectively reversed by MC0704 treatment in MDA-MB-231-DTR cell-implanted tumor tissues (Figure 9D).",
        "Molecular Docking Study of MC0704. To understand the potential interactions of MC0704 with STAT3, docking simulations were conducted using the published crystal structure of STAT3 (PDB: 6NJS). As demonstrated in Figure 10, the bromophenyl group sits in a shallow cleft between Ser636 and Pro639, whereas N-ethyl 3-indole amide moiety lies along a cleft formed by Tyr640, Gln644, and Glu638. MC0704 forms several hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Tyr657, Gln644, and Glu638. The carbonyl group attached to \u03b2-carboline has a hydrogen bonding interaction with the -OH group of Tyr657. In addition, the nitrogen atom of indole and the side chain carbonyl group of Gln644 forms a hydrogen bond, whereas the nitrogen atom of pyridine in \u03b2-carboline has a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide nitrogen of Glu638. MC0704 is also stabilized by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacked interaction between the indole moiety and the phenyl group of Tyr640. An additional amide-\u03c0 stacked interaction is observed between the para-bromophenyl group and the amide bond formed between Val637 and Glu638. Meanwhile, the -Br group contributes to a hydrophobic interaction with the methylene group of Pro639.",

Molecular interactions between protein and ligand were further analyzed using Discovery Studio 2017 Visualizer (BIOVIA, San Diego, CA).",
        "Streptavidin Biotin Pull-Down Assay. MDA-MB-231-DTR cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed with IP lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The whole cell lysates were incubated with 20 \u03bcM of compound 5 or compound 7 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Lysates were then incubated with streptavidin beads (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with 400 \u03bcL of PBS and boiled for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in 50 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) + 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were subjected to western blotting analysis to evaluate engaged STAT3 levels.",
