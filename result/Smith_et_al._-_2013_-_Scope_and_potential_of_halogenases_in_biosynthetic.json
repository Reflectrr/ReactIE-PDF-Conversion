All rightsreserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2013.01.018 Introduction A large and diverse series of halogenated natural productsexist, with the number identified by 2010 exceeding 4700[1]. These compounds, initially considered nothing morethan an oddity, attract interest because of their structures,their biogenesis and their biological activity [2]. In manyof these compounds the halogen is important to biologicalactivity and bioavailability. Halogens are also found inbiosynthetic intermediates where they act as facilitatorsfor chemical reactions such as the cyclopropane ringformation in the marine natural product curacin(Figure 1) [3]. The most common halogen found innatural products is chlorine followed by bromine, whilstiodine and fluorine are considerably rare [4]. The occur-rence of brominated compounds is more frequentlyobserved in marine natural products. In terms of drugdiscovery and development, chlorinated and brominatedcompounds have the merit of being amenable to specificchemical modification using the halogen as a functiona-lisable chemical handle [5] in addition to modulatingCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology 2013, 17:276\u2013283 biological activity and physical properties. Fluorinationis a particularly sought-after halogenation with an excel-lent track record of increasing drug efficacy throughnumerous mechanisms [6].For many years the only known halogenases were thehaloperoxidases. We now have a much better understand-ing of enzymatic halogenation. In the past decade, averitable explosion of new halogenation mechanismsand enzymes has come to light. Among them are fla-vin-dependent halogenases and a-ketoglutarate-depend-ent non-haem iron oxygenases that have modified wellknown reaction mechanism to perform chlorination andbromination reactions; and S-adenosylmethionine-utilis-ing (AdoMet-utilising) enzymes that are capable of fluor-ination or chlorination through a nucleophilic mechanism[7,8]. Haloperoxidases Haloperoxidases have been known for a very long time ashalogenating enzymes. One example is thyroid peroxi-dase which is involved in thyroxine biosynthesis [9]. Thetwo major classes comprise haem iron peroxidases andvanadium peroxidases. The electrophilic halogenatingspecies generated by these enzymes is likely to be hypo-halous acid, a highly reactive halogenating agent. Chlori-nation, bromination as well as iodination are observedwith this family of halogenases; however, no fluorinationactivity has yet been demonstrated, mostly likely due tothe high electronegativity of fluorine.The general mechanism of haloperoxidases involves thegeneration of the halogenating species, through oxidationof the halide, and is dependent on hydrogen peroxide(Figure 2a). The reaction mechanism of haem peroxi-dases is likely to parallel that of other haem enzymes[10,11]. The halide ion is oxidised in the active site toferric hypohalite by the ferryl-oxo species. This species inturn is generated through binding of hydrogen peroxideto the ferric resting state (Figure 2c). Similarly, invanadium-dependent halogenases hydrogen peroxidebinds to the metal which is followed by halide additionand finally the release of the hypohalous acid (Figure 2b)[8,12]. Haloperoxidases often exhibit low regiospecificity due tothe freely diffusing halogenating agent that is generatedand due to the high reactivity of hypohalous acid; as aresult a suite of various monohalogenated, dihalogenatedand trihalogenated metabolites can be generated.

However, successful applications with haloperoxi-dases have been demonstrated. For example, the biopro-cess department of Merck demonstrated that indeneoxide, an intermediate in the synthesis of the HIV-1protease inhibitor Crixivan1(Indinavir) can be obtainedthrough biotransformation [14].It can be argued that many of the chloroperoxidases orbromoperoxidases described in the literature are not halo-genases by primary function but the observed halogenatingactivity stems from the general ability of peroxidases tooxidise halides when taken out of biological context. Non-native halogenase activity could be the cause of HOClbeing released from the enzyme active site. This could alsoexplain the apparent lack of stereoselectivity and regios-electivity of some haloperoxidases that seem to contradictthe specific halogenation patterns in natural products.The existence of highly regiospecific and stereospecificvanadium-dependent haloperoxidases such as Mcl24 ofthe merochlorin pathway (speculative) and NapHI of thenapyradiomycin pathway implies that the highly reactivenature of the postulated hypohalous acid reagent can bewww.sciencedirect.com moderated and that these enzymes do indeed bind theirsubstrates in a highly specific fashion [15,16None,17].Flavin-dependent halogenasesThe discovery of PrnA, a flavin-dependent halogenasefrom the pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis, demonstrated thatalternative, more specific mechanisms of halogenationexisted [18]. The exact mechanism with which flavin-dependent halogenases operate is still under debate, andmechanistic details, such as which active site residuesparticipate, may actually vary between members of thefamily. The reader is referred to a number of excellentreviews on the topic [8,19\u201321]. Halogenation with flavin-dependent enzymes involves an electrophilic speciessuch as hypohalous acid which is generated from thereaction of reduced flavin with molecular oxygen(Figure 2d). The reduced flavin in turn is provided byan additional enzyme, flavin reductase. Most halogenasesbind the flavin co-factor non-covalently; however, studieson CmlS from the chloramphenicol biosynthesis havedemonstrated that the flavin co-factor can also be cova-lently attached to the enzyme [21]. The most notablefeature in flavin-dependent halogenases is that the flavinbinding site and the substrate binding site are separatedby a 10 A\u030along tunnel through which the hypohalous acidCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology 2013, 278 Biocatalysis and BiotransformationFigure 2H2O2 H2O2 H2O O2 CH2 CO2 O2 H2 C H OH R\u2019 R\u2019 H2 CR\u2019 O O R N NH HO HO OH OH V N HO HO OH OH OH O OH OH O V N His HisCys S SS Cys CysCys OH S FeIII FeIII FeIII His His R O O O FeIV+\u2022 FeIII N H N H HO V N His N H \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Cl Cl Cl Cl Cl Cl \u2013 \u2013 Cl \u2013Cl Cl FeII His His R O O OCl FeIV His His R O O Cl H2 OH2 H2O substrate C H R\u2019 O FeII His His RO OCl Cl \u2013 HO HO O OO H H O OH HO V N His N H N H H N O OOH O R N N NH HO N H O OH O R N N NH N H O O O (a) (b) (c)Vanadium haloperoxidases(d) (e)Flavin-dependent halogenases Non-haem iron halogenasesHaem haloperoxidasesH + \u2013 \u2022 Cl ClH2O2 + HO HO\u2013 Nu Nu-Cl \u2013 \u2013 Current Opinion in Chemical BiologyOutline of halogenase reaction mechanisms.

Thus, the sites of halide oxidation andsubstrate halogenation are spatially separated.So far, all characterised flavin-dependent halogenasescatalyse electrophilic substitution at electron-rich or acti-vated centres as found in indoles and pyrroles, in the orthoposition of phenolic compounds or at Ca of b-ketoacids.The substrates can be free compounds as for tryptophanchlorination by PrnA, or they can be attached to carrierproteins as for the PltA-catalysed dichlorination of pyr-role-2-carboxylate [18,22]. Other research has demon-strated that flavin-dependent halogenases can be foundworking in parallel with NRPS/PKS enzymes, showinghalogenation taking place alongside synthesis rather thanonly as a pre-synthetic or post-synthetic modification [23].Non-haem iron-dependent halogenasesWhereas the above-discussed halogenases are restrictedto electron-rich substrates, the non-haem iron-dependenthalogenases (also referred to as a-ketoglutarate-depend-ent halogenases) exploit a radical halogen species to allowhalogenation of unactivated, aliphatic carbon centres [24].This can result in natural products containing halogens inunusual contexts such as the dichlorovinyl feature foundin Trigocherrin A [25].The mechanism is thought to follow closely that of othera-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases and has been dis-cussed in more detail elsewhere [8,26,27]. The iron(II) inhalogenases is liganded by two histidine residues, a-ketoglutarate and chloride (Figure 2e). It has been shownthat binding of a-ketoglutarate and chloride induces aconformational change in the curacin halogenase domainfrom an open to a closed form [28NoneNone]. Upon binding of thesubstrate and molecular oxygen, the decarboxylation of a-ketoglutarate is triggered and the reactive oxo-ferrylintermediate is formed. Hydrogen abstraction from thesubstrate is followed by transfer of the halide to thesubstrate radical.There are two issues that might affect the potential ofnon-haem iron-dependent halogenases as general bioca-talysts. To date, all substrates for this class of enzyme aremolecules tethered to the phosphopantetheinyl arm ofcarrier proteins [26]. Should this trend prove consistent,the formation of carrier protein-bound unnatural sub-strates would be required before halogenation and theanalysis of reaction products is somewhat less straightfor-ward compared to diffusible products. Furthermore, it hasbeen shown for SyrB2 that slight repositioning of thesubstrate can alter the reaction outcome to favour hydrox-ylation over chlorination [29]. It remains to be seen towhat extent this will impede the halogenation of alterna-tive substrates.An interesting aspect of a-ketoglutarate-dependent halo-genases is the number of halogen transfers that can bewww.sciencedirect.com carried out by one active site. In the biosynthesis ofbarbamide, for example, BarB2 is capable of oxidisingleucyl-S-carrier protein up to the d-dichlorinated productbut an additional halogenase, BarB1, is required to obtainthe final d-trichlorinated valine derivative [30,31]. Incontrast, the aforementioned SyrB2 halogenase transfersonly a single chlorine to Cd of threonyl-S-carrier protein[32]. Halogenases using S-adenosylmethionineThe only fluorinating enzyme discovered so far is FDASfrom Streptomyces cattleya [33]. A fluoride anion acts as thenucleophile attacking the C50of AdoMet liberating meth-ionine in an SN2 fashion [34,35]. In S. cattleya 50-fluoro-50-deoxyadenosine is subsequently catabolised to give fluor-oacetaldehyde as a branch point metabolite. Fluoroace-taldehyde can either be oxidised to fluoroacetic acid orundergo a transaldol reaction to give fluorothreonine[36,37]. In addition to fluoride, FDAS was also able toutilise chloride but not bromide or iodide [38]. Nativechlorination using the AdoMet-dependent mechanismwas reported for salinosporamide biosynthesis [39].The halogenase SalL is not capable of utilising fluoridewhereas bromide and iodide are accepted in this case.The chlorinase SalL could be substituted with the fluor-inase FDAS to produce fluorosalinosporamide [40None](Figure 3).The only other example of a nucleophilic halogenation isfound in the biosynthesis of halomethanes (MeCl, MeBr,MeI). The two substrates are the same as for the abovementioned FDAS and SalL enzymes, a halide ion andAdoMet, but rather than substitution at C50of AdoMetthe nucleophile attacks at the S-methyl as in all othermethyltransferases. The similarity in mechanism tomethyltransferases is reflected in the structure of thehalomethane synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana [41].Halogenases in synthetic biology applicationsThere now exist a number of examples where halo-genases have been used to manipulate biosynthetic path-ways. Tryptophan halogenases have proven to be ofparticular usefulness, as many biologically active alkaloidsare derived from tryptophan, and hence, halogenation ofthe amino acid precursor can potentially lead to theengineered biosynthesis of the correspondingly haloge-nated alkaloid [42\u201344].One of the earliest examples is the inclusion of differenttryptophan halogenases in hybrid rebeccamycin\u2013stauros-porin systems [45]. A heterologous host, Streptomyces albus,was employed to reconstitute the indolocarbazole path-ways from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes (rebeccamycin) andStreptomyces longisporoflavus (staurosporin). This facili-tated the recombination of pathway genes and theinclusion of halogenases in a new context. The rebecca-mycin tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH [46] was capable ofCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology 2013, 280 Biocatalysis and BiotransformationFigure 3Halogenase Hal Hal Hal MTase Hal \u2013 Me(b) (a) H2N CO2H CO2H CO2H SCoA H2N S Hal HO O OH HO O OH O H F O O OH OH F F AdoMet Halomethane SAH Met Adenine Adenine Fluoroacetaldehyde Fluoroacetate Haloethylmalonyl-CoA O O O OH NH Salinosporamide A (Hal = Cl)Fluorosalinosporamide (Hal = F)Fluorothreonine + Current Opinion in Chemical BiologyReactions of AdoMet-dependent halogenases.

SAH: S-adenosylhomocysteine.promoting production of chlorinated indolocarbazolecompounds similar to staurosporin. This finding is per-haps unsurprising as both pathways are evolutionarilyrelated. Interestingly, when the tryptophan 5-halogenasePyrH [47] was co-expressed, the resulting indolocarba-zoles were mono-chlorinated indicating that the substratetolerance of the downstream pathway enzymes was reach-ing a limit. The same was observed when the tryptophan6-halogenase Thal [48] was co-expressed. In the lattercase, the genes for the conversion of chromopyrrolic acidto the indolocarbazole aglycone had not been included.Early studies targeting the biosynthetic pathways of ami-nocoumarin antibiotics showed that replacement of thenovobiocin 80-methyltransferase with the clorobiocin 80-halogenase yielded 80-chlorinated novobiocin derivativesCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology 2013, 17:276\u2013283 [49]. However, it was noted that introduction of the balhi-mycin halogenase BlhA did not lead to chlorinated novo-biocin derivatives. As both halogenases are thought tohalogenate the same substrate, a carrier protein-boundb-hydroxytyrosine, the failure with the evolutionarily moredistant blhA gene in the novobiocin context could be due tothe specificity of the halogenase for its cognate carrierprotein highlighting an additional level of complexity withrespect to substrate specificity. It has to be noted thoughthat the actual substrate for Clo-Hal is not known andhalogenation may occur at a later stage. In contrast, thehormaomycin halogenase HrmQ, that is thought to usecarrier protein-bound pyrrole-2-carboxylate as substrate,was able to produce chloropyrrole-containing clorobiocinderivatives demonstrating that carrier protein specificitycan be relaxed [50].www.sciencedirect.com Scope and potential of halogenases Smith, Gru\u0308schow and Goss 281The O\u2019Connor group have been highlighting the ver-satility of halogenases by incorporating PrnA into thebiosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloid naturalproducts produced by the Madagascar periwinkle plantCatharanthus roseus [51None]. Plants are known for theircapacity to produce a large and diverse range of naturalproducts, but biosynthetic work in plants is oftenhampered by the fact that the genes involved in plantsecondary metabolite biosynthesis tend to be scatteredaround the genome, rather than being found in clustersas in bacteria. The O\u2019Connor group felt that this madeplants an attractive target for biosynthetic modificationusing halogenases. In 2010 the group published apaper that demonstrated the successful incorporationof chlorine into tryptophan-derived alkaloids derivedfrom strictosidine in planta by introducing the trypto-phan 5-halogenase PyrH or the tryptophan 7-halogen-ase RebH [51None]. However, the group noted theaccumulation of chloro-tryptophan in the plant tissuesthat was due to the substrate specificity of tryptophandecarboxylase. This bottleneck was eliminated byreengineering RebH to act preferentially on trypta-mine, a substrate that is not accepted by the nativehalogenase, thus opening up the potential scope offlavin-dependent halogenases [52NoneNone]. In the same year,van Pe\u0301e and co-workers demonstrated that the regios-electivity of flavin-dependent halogenases could bealtered through site-directed mutagenesis in the activesite. A single amino acid change converted a trypto-phan 7-halogenase into an enzyme that produced thenative 7-halotryptophan alongside the new product 5-halotryptophan [53].The flavin-dependent tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnAwas also employed to produce chlorinated pacidamy-cin derivatives [5]. Pacidamycin is a uridyl peptideantibiotic noted for its activity against Pseudomonasaeruginosa. To avoid potential bottlenecks, precur-sor-directed biosynthesis with tryptophan derivativeswas conducted to test for the scope and limitations ofthe natural pathway enzymes to cope with substitutedindole rings [54]. As substitution at the 7-position ofthe indole ring was very well tolerated, prnA wasintroduced into the genome of the producing organ-ism, Streptomyces coeruleorubidus, resulting in pro-duction of the halogenated metabolite. It was notnecessary to include the concomitant flavin reductaseor to target the halogenase gene into the pacidamycingene cluster. The group\u2019s work went on to highlightthat natural product halogenation is not necessarily theend of the line synthetically, going on to use mild,aqueous, palladium catalysed Suzuki\u2013Miyauracoupling techniques that act on the installed chlorinehandle to produce a range of chemically diversifiedproducts [5], highlighting the potential that thisapproach can have as a true collaboration betweenbiosynthetic and chemical approaches.www.sciencedirect.com Problems with intermediate accumulation have also beenencountered when attempting to incorporate a 6-chlor-inase from the thienodolin biosynthesis into the pyrrolni-trin pathway by Siebold et al., leading to the production ofa new 6-chlorinated pyrrolnitrin precursor that was notaccepted downstream, and consequently not to the tar-geted compound [48].The future challenges of halogenases inbiotechnology and synthetic biologyMajor challenges will lie in modulating and adaptingsubstrate specificities. When working with halogenasesthat require carrier protein-bound substrates it will haveto be determined how much protein-protein interactionscontribute to the substrate selectivity of the halogenase.Very little data exist to address this question directly. Anotable exception is a recent study by Busche et al. thatindicated that the curacin halogenase domain CurA Halrequires its cognate acyl carrier protein partner [55NoneNone].Another issue lies in the timing of the halogenation: formany if not most of the characterised halogenases to datethe halogenation occurs very early on. Taking thesehalogenases into a new biosynthetic context entails thatall downstream enzymes will have to cope with thehalogenation. Abrogated biosynthesis or production ofshunt products, possibly even mediated through thepresence of a relatively reactive bromine or chlorine,are likely to occur and some examples have been listedabove. Fluorination and its equivalent mechanism inchlorination are taking this to the extreme as only a singlereaction is known, that of the nucleophilic substitution ofmethionine from S-adenosylmethionine with fluoride orchloride. Diversification then occurs through modificationor breakdown of 50-halo-50-deoxyadenosine. Taking intoaccount how useful fluorination is in pharmacology, thediscovery and development of further fluorinases will beextremely important.But not all is doom and gloom. Halogenases can beisolated from a wide variety of organisms and habitats,and we have probably only found the tip of the iceberg ofthe catalytic potential that exists. For all classes of halo-genases more examples of late-stage halogenations areemerging. The concomitant larger active site that isrequired to accommodate highly elaborate substratesmay be a good starting point for further enzyme engin-eering. Examples include Rdc2 from radicicol biosyn-thesis or the ansamycin halogenases Asm12 and Nat1[56,57]. The discovery of a flavin-dependent halogenasein lantibiotic biosynthesis further opens up the possibilityof chlorinating specific residues in peptide substrates [58].And lastly, even though haloperoxidases have fallen outof favour in recent years they may yet celebrate a come-back. In particular the recently discovered highly specificvanadium-dependent peroxidases from the merochlorinand napyradiomycin pathways may bring about a renewedinterest in the catalytic potential of this class of enzymes.Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2013, 282 Biocatalysis and BiotransformationCurrently, synthetic routes win out (with a few exceptions)with respect to versatility and efficiency in the preparationof halogenated compounds. However, enzymes capable ofhalogenating all kinds of different chemical groups fromelectron-rich to electron-poor, from aromatic to aliphatichave been characterised. Given that synthetic halogena-tion reactions are not particularly easy and trivial trans-formations in combination with the pharmaceuticalusefulness of halogenated molecules, it will be worthinvesting into the research of halogenating enzymes.References and recommended readingPapers of particular interest, published within the period of review,have been highlighted as:None of special interestNoneNone of outstanding interest1.

        "Introduction A large and diverse series of halogenated natural productsexist, with the number identified by 2010 exceeding 4700[1]. These compounds, initially considered nothing morethan an oddity, attract interest because of their structures,their biogenesis and their biological activity [2]. In manyof these compounds the halogen is important to biologicalactivity and bioavailability. Halogens are also found inbiosynthetic intermediates where they act as facilitatorsfor chemical reactions such as the cyclopropane ringformation in the marine natural product curacin(Figure 1) [3]. The most common halogen found innatural products is chlorine followed by bromine, whilstiodine and fluorine are considerably rare [4]. The occur-rence of brominated compounds is more frequentlyobserved in marine natural products. In terms of drugdiscovery and development, chlorinated and brominatedcompounds have the merit of being amenable to specificchemical modification using the halogen as a functiona-lisable chemical handle [5] in addition to",

        "[6].For many years the only known halogenases were thehaloperoxidases. We now have a much better understand-ing of enzymatic halogenation. In the past decade, averitable explosion of new halogenation mechanismsand enzymes has come to light. Among them are fla-vin-dependent halogenases and a-ketoglutarate-depend-ent non-haem iron oxygenases that have modified wellknown reaction mechanism to perform chlorination andbromination reactions; and S-adenosylmethionine-utilis-ing (AdoMet-utilising) enzymes that are capable of fluor-ination or chlorination through a nucleophilic mechanism[7,8].",
        "Haloperoxidases Haloperoxidases have been known for a very long time ashalogenating enzymes. One example is thyroid peroxi-dase which is involved in thyroxine biosynthesis [9]. Thetwo major classes comprise haem iron peroxidases andvanadium peroxidases. The electrophilic halogenatingspecies generated by these enzymes is likely to be hypo-halous acid, a highly reactive halogenating agent. Chlori-nation, bromination as well as iodination are observedwith this family of halogenases; however, no fluorinationactivity has yet been demonstrated, mostly likely due tothe high electronegativity of",
        "fluorine.The general mechanism of haloperoxidases involves thegeneration of the halogenating species, through oxidationof the halide, and is dependent on hydrogen peroxide(Figure 2a). The reaction mechanism of haem peroxi-dases is likely to parallel that of other haem enzymes[10,11]. The halide ion is oxidised in the active site toferric hypohalite by the ferryl-oxo species. This species inturn is generated through binding of hydrogen peroxideto the ferric resting state (Figure 2c). Similarly, invanadium-dependent halogenases hydrogen peroxidebinds to the metal which is followed by halide additionand finally the release of the hypohalous acid (Figure 2b)[8,12].",
        "Haloperoxidases often exhibit low regiospecificity due tothe freely diffusing halogenating agent that is generatedand due to the high reactivity of hypohalous acid; as aresult a suite of various monohalogenated, dihalogenatedand trihalogenated metabolites can be generated.

        "[14].It can be argued that many of the chloroperoxidases orbromoperoxidases described in the literature are not halo-genases by primary function but the observed halogenatingactivity stems from the general ability of peroxidases tooxidise halides when taken out of biological context. Non-native halogenase activity could be the cause of HOClbeing released from the enzyme active site.

The exact mechanism with which flavin-dependent halogenases operate is still under debate, andmechanistic details, such as which active site residuesparticipate, may actually vary between members of thefamily. The reader is referred to a number of excellentreviews on the topic [8,19\u201321]. Halogenation with flavin-dependent enzymes involves an electrophilic speciessuch as hypohalous acid which is generated from thereaction of reduced flavin with molecular oxygen(Figure 2d). The reduced flavin in turn is provided byan additional enzyme, flavin reductase. Most halogenasesbind the flavin co-factor non-covalently; however, studieson CmlS from the chloramphenicol biosynthesis havedemonstrated that the flavin co-factor can also be cova-lently attached to the enzyme [21]. The most notablefeature in flavin-dependent halogenases is that the flavinbinding site and the substrate binding site are separatedby a 10 A\u030along tunnel through which the hypohalous",

Other research has demon-strated that flavin-dependent halogenases can be foundworking in parallel with NRPS/PKS enzymes, showinghalogenation taking place alongside synthesis rather thanonly as a pre-synthetic or post-synthetic modification",

The iron(II) inhalogenases is liganded by two histidine residues, a-ketoglutarate and chloride (Figure 2e). It has been shownthat binding of a-ketoglutarate and chloride induces aconformational change in the curacin halogenase domainfrom an open to a closed form [28NoneNone]. Upon binding of thesubstrate and molecular oxygen, the decarboxylation of a-ketoglutarate is triggered and the reactive oxo-ferrylintermediate is formed.

To date, all substrates for this class of enzyme aremolecules tethered to the phosphopantetheinyl arm ofcarrier proteins [26]. Should this trend prove consistent,the formation of carrier protein-bound unnatural sub-strates would be required before halogenation and theanalysis of reaction products is somewhat less straightfor-ward compared to diffusible products. Furthermore, it hasbeen shown for SyrB2 that slight repositioning of thesubstrate can alter the reaction outcome to favour hydrox-ylation over chlorination [29].

        "Halogenases using S-adenosylmethionineThe only fluorinating enzyme discovered so far is FDASfrom Streptomyces cattleya [33]. A fluoride anion acts as thenucleophile attacking the C50of AdoMet liberating meth-ionine in an SN2 fashion [34,35]. In S. cattleya 50-fluoro-50-deoxyadenosine is subsequently catabolised to give fluor-oacetaldehyde as a branch point metabolite. Fluoroace-taldehyde can either be oxidised to fluoroacetic acid orundergo a transaldol reaction to give fluorothreonine[36,37]. In addition to fluoride, FDAS was also able toutilise chloride but not bromide or iodide [38]. Nativechlorination using the AdoMet-dependent mechanismwas reported for salinosporamide biosynthesis [39].The halogenase SalL is not capable of utilising fluoridewhereas bromide and iodide are accepted in this case.The chlorinase SalL could be substituted with the fluor-inase FDAS to produce fluorosalinosporamide [40None](Figure",

The two substrates are the same as for the abovementioned FDAS and SalL enzymes, a halide ion andAdoMet, but rather than substitution at C50of AdoMetthe nucleophile attacks at the S-methyl as in all othermethyltransferases.

        "281The O\u2019Connor group have been highlighting the ver-satility of halogenases by incorporating PrnA into thebiosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloid naturalproducts produced by the Madagascar periwinkle plantCatharanthus roseus [51None]. Plants are known for theircapacity to produce a large and diverse range of naturalproducts, but biosynthetic work in plants is oftenhampered by the fact that the genes involved in plantsecondary metabolite biosynthesis tend to be scatteredaround the genome, rather than being found in clustersas in bacteria. The O\u2019Connor group felt that this madeplants an attractive target for biosynthetic modificationusing halogenases. In 2010 the group published apaper that demonstrated the successful incorporationof chlorine into tryptophan-derived alkaloids derivedfrom strictosidine in planta by introducing the trypto-phan 5-halogenase PyrH or the tryptophan 7-halogen-ase RebH [51None]. However, the group noted theaccumulation of chloro-tryptophan in the plant tissuesthat was due to the substrate specificity of tryptophandecarboxylase. This bottleneck was eliminated byreengineering RebH to act preferentially on trypta-mine, a substrate that is not accepted by the nativehalogenase, thus opening up the potential scope offlavin-dependent halogenases [52NoneNone]. In the same year,van Pe\u0301e and co-workers demonstrated that the regios-electivity of flavin-dependent halogenases could bealtered through site-directed mutagenesis in the activesite. A single amino acid change converted a trypto-phan 7-halogenase into an enzyme that produced thenative 7-halotryptophan alongside the new product 5-halotryptophan",
        "[53].The flavin-dependent tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnAwas also employed to produce chlorinated pacidamy-cin derivatives [5]. Pacidamycin is a uridyl peptideantibiotic noted for its activity against Pseudomonasaeruginosa. To avoid potential bottlenecks, precur-sor-directed biosynthesis with tryptophan derivativeswas conducted to test for the scope and limitations ofthe natural pathway enzymes to cope with substitutedindole rings [54]. As substitution at the 7-position ofthe indole ring was very well tolerated, prnA wasintroduced into the genome of the producing organ-ism, Streptomyces coeruleorubidus, resulting in pro-duction of the halogenated metabolite. It was notnecessary to include the concomitant flavin reductaseor to target the halogenase gene into the pacidamycingene cluster. The group\u2019s work went on to highlightthat natural product halogenation is not necessarily theend of the line synthetically, going on to use mild,aqueous, palladium catalysed Suzuki\u2013Miyauracoupling techniques that act on the installed chlorinehandle to produce a range of chemically diversifiedproducts [5], highlighting the potential that thisapproach can have as a true collaboration betweenbiosynthetic and chemical",
        "approaches.www.sciencedirect.com Problems with intermediate accumulation have also beenencountered when attempting to incorporate a 6-chlor-inase from the thienodolin biosynthesis into the pyrrolni-trin pathway by Siebold et al., leading to the production ofa new 6-chlorinated pyrrolnitrin precursor that was notaccepted downstream, and consequently not to the tar-geted compound",
        "[48].The future challenges of halogenases inbiotechnology and synthetic biologyMajor challenges will lie in modulating and adaptingsubstrate specificities. When working with halogenasesthat require carrier protein-bound substrates it will haveto be determined how much protein-protein interactionscontribute to the substrate selectivity of the halogenase.Very little data exist to address this question directly. Anotable exception is a recent study by Busche et al. thatindicated that the curacin halogenase domain CurA Halrequires its cognate acyl carrier protein partner [55NoneNone].Another issue lies in the timing of the halogenation: formany if not most of the characterised halogenases to datethe halogenation occurs very early on. Taking thesehalogenases into a new biosynthetic context entails thatall downstream enzymes will have to cope with thehalogenation. Abrogated biosynthesis or production ofshunt products, possibly even mediated through thepresence of a relatively reactive bromine or chlorine,are likely to occur and some examples have been listedabove. Fluorination and its equivalent mechanism inchlorination are taking this to the extreme as only a singlereaction is known, that of the nucleophilic substitution ofmethionine from S-adenosylmethionine with fluoride orchloride. Diversification then occurs through modificationor breakdown of 50-halo-50-deoxyadenosine. Taking intoaccount how useful fluorination is in pharmacology, thediscovery and development of further fluorinases will beextremely",
        "important.But not all is doom and gloom. Halogenases can beisolated from a wide variety of organisms and habitats,and we have probably only found the tip of the iceberg ofthe catalytic potential that exists. For all classes of halo-genases more examples of late-stage halogenations areemerging. The concomitant larger active site that isrequired to accommodate highly elaborate substratesmay be a good starting point for further enzyme engin-eering. Examples include Rdc2 from radicicol biosyn-thesis or the ansamycin halogenases Asm12 and Nat1[56,57]. The discovery of a flavin-dependent halogenasein lantibiotic biosynthesis further opens up the possibilityof chlorinating specific residues in peptide substrates [58].And lastly, even though haloperoxidases have fallen outof favour in recent years they may yet celebrate a come-back. In particular the recently discovered highly specificvanadium-dependent peroxidases from the merochlorinand napyradiomycin pathways may bring about a renewedinterest in the catalytic potential of this class of",
