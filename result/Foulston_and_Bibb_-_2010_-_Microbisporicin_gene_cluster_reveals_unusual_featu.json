Bibb1 John Innes Centre, Norwich NR4 7UH, United Kingdom Communicated by Arnold L. Demain, Drew University, Madison, NJ, June 13, 2010 (received for review April 29, 2010) Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotics. The biosynthetic gene cluster for microbisporicin, a potent lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora corallina containing chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroxyproline residues, was identified by genome scanning and isolated from an M. corallina cosmid library. Heterologous expression in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 confirmed that all of the genes required for microbis-poricin biosynthesis were present in the cluster. Deletion, in M. cor-allina, of the gene (mibA) predicted to encode the prepropeptide abolished microbisporicin production. Further deletion analysis re-vealed insights into the biosynthesis of this unusual and potentially clinically useful lantibiotic, shedding light on mechanisms of regula-tion and self-resistance. In particular, we report an example of the involvement of a tryptophan halogenase in the modification of a ribosomally synthesized peptide and the pathway-specific regula-tion of an antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster by an extracytoplasmic function \u03c3 factor\u2013anti-\u03c3 factor complex. antibiotic | extracytoplasmic function | halogenase | Microbispora | peptide | \u03c3 factor Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationallymodified peptide antibiotics produced by Gram-positive bac-teria. They are characterized by lanthionine and methyl lanthio-nine bridges that give lantibiotics their characteristic conforma-tions and stability (1). Lantibiotics are encoded by a structural gene (generically named lanA) that encodes a prepropeptide with an N-terminal leader peptide followed by the region that will become the ma-ture lantibiotic (the propeptide). The prepropeptide undergoes modification and processing before the mature product is exported from the cell, coincident with, or followed by, leader peptide removal. The N-terminal leader sequence may have roles in directing export, retaining the prelantibiotic in an in-active state until export and recruiting modifying enzymes (1). Formation of lanthionine bridges occurs via the dehydration of serine and threonine residues, followed by cyclization with cys-teine residues. In type AI lantibiotics (e.g., nisin), dehydration is carried out by a LanB enzyme and cyclization by LanC. In type AII (e.g., lacticin 481) and B (e.g., cinnamycin) lantibiotics, a bifunctional LanM carries out both of these reactions. For-mation of C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine requires a LanD enzyme. Additional genes, such as those involved in pathway-specific regulation, lantibiotic export, and producer cell immunity, are also found in lantibiotic gene clusters (1). Strains of the species Microbispora corallina (2) produce a group of potent bactericidal lantibiotic variants collectively named microbisporicin (3\u20135) (Fig. 1A). Microbisporicin has one methyllanthionine and three lanthionine bridges and an S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine at its C terminus. It also con-tains two unusual lantibiotic modifications: 5-chlorotryptophan and 3, 4-dihydroxyproline (4, 5). The increasing incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial patho-gens has resulted in an urgent need for new, clinically useful antibiotics. Microbisporicin is active against a wide range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, selectively inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus megaterium, prob-ably by binding to the immediate precursor for cell wall bio-synthesis, lipid II (4, 5). It is active against methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-intermediate resistant strains of S. aureus and, un-usually for a lantibiotic, also against some Gram-negative species (4, 5). Microbisporicin, under the commercial name NAI-107, is currently in late preclinical-phase trials and has demonstrated superior efficacy in animal models of multidrug resistant infec-tions compared with the drugs of last resort, linezolid and vanco-mycin.* Interestingly, no microbisporicin-resistant mutants were observed during these studies.\u2020 Understanding how microbis-poricin is made could enable the development of variants with improved clinical activity. Few examples of actinomycete lantibiotic gene clusters exist. Those that do (cinnamycin and actagardine) belong to type B lantibiotics (6, 7). Our aim was to clone and characterize the type AI microbisporicin biosynthetic gene cluster from M. corallina NRRL 30420 and to develop M. corallina as a genetic system in which targeted mutagenesis could be performed to elucidate the functions of individual genes. There were no reported methods by which M. corallina, a so-called rare actinomycete, could be transformed with DNA, and only a few reports of transformation in the Streptosporangiaceae, the family to which M. corallina belongs. To complement genetic analysis in M. corallina, we also set out to express the microbisporicin gene cluster in a heterol-ogous host and to define the minimal gene set required for microbisporicin production. Results Identification of the Microbisporicin Gene Cluster by Genome Scanning. Genome scanning was used to identify genes from the micro-bisporicin gene cluster. M. corallina genomic DNA (gDNA) was subjected to 454 sequencing (Cogenics), yielding 4.6 Mb of se-quence on 7,580 assembled contigs. Sequence analysis identified a contig encoding homologs of LanC and LanD proteins from other lantibiotic gene clusters. Other contigs encoded proteins homologous to the prepropeptide (LanA) of microbisporicin [deduced from the NMR structure of microbisporcin (4, 5)], a putative lantibiotic dehydratase (LanB), and a tryptophan hal-ogenase [with homology to PyrH from Streptomyces rugosporus (8)].

Primers LF001F and LF004R were used to amplify an \u22481,250-bp probe from the lanC-lanD region that was hybridized to an Escherichia coli cosmid library ofM. corallina gDNA to identify clones containing the microbisporicin gene cluster. Six cosmids were identified, five of which were shown by PCR and restriction mapping to contain all of the previously identified contigs. One of the cosmids, pIJ12125, was sequenced. Genes Within the Biosynthetic Cluster. The 36,668-bp insert of pIJ12125 contains 33 complete ORFs [determined using Arte-mis (9); Fig. 2 and Table S2], the products of which are de-scribed below. MibA is the 57-aa prepropeptide of microbisporicin, with a leader sequence extending from residues 1 to 33. The propeptide sequence agrees with the published NMR structure of micro-bisporicin (Fig. 1B) (4, 5). Alignment of the putative leader pep-tide with those of other lantibiotics, such as nisin, gallidermin, and epidermin, revealed a possibly conserved \u201cFNLD\u201d motif (LDLD in microbisporicin; Fig. 1B) potentially involved in processing (10). The MibA cleavage site resembles those of other type AI lantibiotics (Fig. 1B), with proline at the -2 position and alanine at -4 (1).mibA seems to be at the start of an operon that contains modification and export genes. A 247-bp gap lies between the 5\u2032 end ofmibA and the preceding oppositely transcribed gene mibX and presumably contains the mibA promoter, whereas 117 bp of noncoding sequence between mibA and mibB might reflect the presence of a transcriptional attenuator. Indeed, an RNA sec-ondary structure (\u0394G= -123 kJ mol-1) was predicted for region 8,820\u20138,854 bp using Clone Manager 6 (Scientific & Educational Software; Fig. 2). Such structures occur in other lantibiotic gene clusters and are thought to maintain an appropriate stoichiometry between the prepropeptide and the modification enzymes (11). MibB is a homolog of lantibiotic dehydratases (LanBs). Closest relatives are LanB-like proteins from Bacillus clausii, as well as other actinomycetes, such as Streptomyces noursei and Strepto-myces griseus (both with 34% identity), that are not known tomake lantibiotics. Homologs from well-studied lantibiotics include SpaB (subtilin), EpiB (epidermin), andMutB (mutacin III).MibB is likely to dehydrate serine and threonine residues in the pre-propeptide to yield didehydroalanine and didehydrobutyrine, re-spectively. MibC shows homology to lantibiotic cyclases (LanCs), including SpaC (subtilin), EpiC (epidermin), and MutC (mutacin III), and is likely to be involved in forming the (methyl-)lanthio-nine bridges of microbisporicin. MibD is homologous to fla-voproteins, specifically those involved in S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine formation, such as MrsD (mersacidin) and MutD (mutacin III). LanDs decarboxylate the C-terminal cysteine of the peptide chain to yield a free thiol group that subsequently forms a lanthionine bridge via cyclization with a propeptide dehydrated serine or threonine, a reaction likely catalyzed by LanC (1). MibD is presumably involved in formation of the S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine moiety at the C terminus of microbisporicin (4, 5). MibT belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, whereas MibU is homologous to ABC-transporter per-meases. MibTU are close homologs of a two-component ABC transporter, CinTH, likely involved in cinnamycin export (7), and probably play a similar role in microbisporicin secretion. MibV is a hypothetical protein with few homologs, the closest Fig. 1.

(36% identity) occurring in the actinomycete Nocardiopsis das-sonvillei and apparently part of an uncharacterized lantibiotic gene cluster. MibE shows homology to ABC-transporter per-meases, whereas MibF shares homology with the ABC family of proteins. On the basis of similarity to immunity proteins encoded by other lantibiotic gene clusters [e.g., 24% and 41% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, to LanE and LanF involved in subtilin biosynthesis; permease components typically share lower homology (21\u201326% identity), likely reflecting their different sub-strates], MibEF presumably confer producer immunity by actively transporting microbisporicin away from its lipid II target in the membrane (12). MibH and MibS are homologous to flavin-dependent trypto-phan halogenases and flavin reductases, respectively. Flavin-dependent halogenases require a flavin reductase to provide the FADH2 required for chlorination (13). MibH and MibS likely act coordinately to chlorinate tryptophan at position 4 of micro-bisporicin. MibN shows homology to sodium/proton antiporters, particularly those associated with nonribosomal peptide synthe-tase and glycopeptide biosynthetic gene clusters, such as ComF (complestatin; Streptomyces lavendulae), ForY (fortimicin; Micro-monospora olivasterospora), NapR2 (napyradiomycin; Streptomyces aculeolatus), and StaN (A47934; Streptomyces toyocaensis). The role of this family of proteins is not known. Genes downstream of mibN seem to be involved in sugar metabolism and are unlikely to be part of the mib cluster. mibJ, mibY, and mibZ seem to be translationally coupled and encode proteins with most homology to the products of a gene cluster in Frankia EAN1pec that includes Franean1_3991, a ho-molog of mibX. MibQ shows similarity to lipoproteins, with a predicted signal peptide sequence containing a conserved lipobox motif LAGC (14). MibO is a cytochrome P450 homolog and contains the conserved FGHGxHxCLG motif required for binding heme (15), and it may be responsible for hydroxylation of proline-14 of microbisporicin. MibR, MibW, and MibX all seem to be regulatory proteins. MibR possesses a helix-turn-helix domain found in the LuxR family of regulatory proteins. MibX belongs to the extrac-ytoplasmic function (ECF) family of \u03c3 factors, sharing 49% and 43% amino acid identity with putative ECF \u03c3 factors from Streptosporangium roseum DSM43021 (Sros_1172) and Frankia sp. EAN1pec (Franean1_3991), respectively. Additionally, MibX shares 27% identity with CnrH, an ECF \u03c3 factor regulating co-balt and nickel resistance in Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 (previously Ralstonia metallidurans CH34) (16). ECF \u03c3 factors are a subgroup of RNA polymerase \u03c3 factors that respond to extracellular signals (e.g., membrane stress) by directing RNA polymerase to particular promoter sequences. mibW, down-stream of and apparently translationally coupled to mibX, enc-odes a protein with low levels of similarity to putative anti-\u03c3 factors believed to interact with homologs of MibX; MibW homologs occur in S. roseum DSM43021 (Sros_1171) and Frankia sp. EAN1pec (Franean1_3992), sharing 20% and 18% identity with MibW, respectively. MibW is predicted to have six transmembrane helices and to be embedded in the membrane, with a 73-aa cytoplasmic N-terminal region [TMHMM v.2 (17)]. This, as well as the proximity of mibW to mibX, suggests that MibW acts as an anti-\u03c3 factor to suppress MibX activity. Heterologous Expression of the mib Gene Cluster. An \u22485-kb SspI fragment of pIJ10702 (18), containing the apramycin resistance gene, the\u03a6C31 integrase gene and corresponding attB site, and an E. coli origin of transfer was used to replace the kanamycin re-sistance gene of the SuperCos vector backbone of pIJ12125 by PCR-targeting (19), yielding pIJ12131. Transfer of pIJ12131 to several Streptomyces species failed to result in microbisporicin production. Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 belongs to the same family as Microbispora, the Streptosporangiaceae, and produces the glycopeptide antibiotic A40926 (20). pIJ12131 was transfer-red intoNonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 by conjugation from E. coli ET12567 pUZ8002 and integration at the \u03a6C31 attachment site (21) confirmed by PCR. Whereas the culture supernatant from a representative exconjugant clearly inhibited growth of Micro-coccus luteus (Fig. 3), those from wild-type Nonomuraea and a vector-only control did not. Production of microbisporicin was confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis of the same culture super-natant (Fig. S1). Thus, all of the genes required for micro-bisporicin production lie within the 36,668-bp insert of pIJ12131. Generation of a mibA Deletion Mutant. A method for the genetic manipulation of M. corallina was developed (SI Results; Fig. S2). mibA of pIJ12125 (which confers kanamycin resistance) was replaced with an apramycin resistance cassette [aac(3)IV] by PCR targeting. The resulting construct was introduced into M. corallina by conjugation from ET12567 pUZ8002 and excon-jugants selected using apramycin. Double-crossover recombinants in whichmibA was replaced by the mutant allele were identified by their apramycin-resistant and kanamycin-sensitive phenotypes and confirmed as \u0394mibA::aac(3)IV by Southern hybridization using pIJ12125 as probe. M. corallina \u0394mibA::aac(3)IV and the parental strain were grown for 7 d in liquid culture. In contrast to the wild-type strain, culture supernatant from the \u0394mibA mutant failed to inhibit M. luteus (Fig. 4), and no microbisporicin was detected by MALDI-TOF analysis (Fig. S3). Thus, mibA is essential for microbisporicin biosynthesis in M. corallina, confirming the iden-tity of the gene cluster. Deletion Analysis. Deletion mutants were similarly generated in M. corallina for mibD, mibTU, mibEF, mibN, mibH, mibV, and mibX. An \u22487-kb segment downstream of mibN was also replaced with the apramycin cassette. Mutations were confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization. Unless stated otherwise, at least two independent clones for each mutant were analyzed and compared with the wild-type strain using bioassays against M. luteus (Fig. 4) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S3) of supernatants from 7-d cultures. Deletion of the 7-kb segment had no effect on microbisporicin production, thus defining the right-hand boundary of the bio-synthetic gene cluster. Deletion of mibD resulted in loss of bio-activity and disappearance of MALDI-TOF peaks associated with the microbisporicin complex. Microbisporicin production was re-stored to wild-type levels by the in trans expression of mibD from themibA promoter (likely to be its native promoter). Surprisingly, deletion of mibTU (only one clone tested) had no effect on microbisporicin production when assessed by both bioassay and Fig. 3. Heterologous production of microbisporicin in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727. Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 wild type (1), containing pIJ10702 vector alone (2), containing pIJ12131 (3), and M. corallina NRRL 30420 (4) were grown for 7 d in VSP medium and 40 \u03bcL of culture supernatant assayed for activity against M. luteus.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Presumably there are other ABC transporters in M. corallina, either in the mib cluster or elsewhere in the genome, able to export the lantibiotic. Deletion of mibN also had no apparent effect on microbisporicin production. In contrast, deletion of mibEF resulted in markedly delayed and greatly reduced levels of microbisporicin production. Whereas supernatants from 3-to 5-d cultures failed (unlike the wild type) to inhibit M. luteus, those from 7-d cultures gave a small zone of in-hibition. Mass spectrometry revealed small amounts of the micro-bisporicin complex in the 7-d culture supernatants. Thus,mibEF are essential for wild-type levels of microbisporicin production, which were restored by the in trans expression of mibEF from their native promoter. Culture supernatants of the mibH mutant retained bioactivity, but MALDI-TOF analysis revealed m/z peaks attributable only to the nonchlorinated form of microbisporicin (Table S1) (3). The presence of deschloromicrobisporicin in these samples is confirmed by the shift in the observed isotope pattern (Fig. S4). Expression in trans ofmibHS from themibEF promoter (likely to be the native promoter) revealed masses attributable to both the chlorinated and nonchlorinated forms of microbisporicin. Thus, MibH seems to be the halogenase responsible for chlorination of microbisporicin. Deletion of mibV yielded essentially the same results. However, MALDI-TOF analysis of culture supernatants of three independent mibV mutants revealed additional com-pounds with masses lower than those of BA-1768\u03b21 that may be microbisporicin degradation products. Deletion of mibX (only one clone tested) resulted in loss of microbisporicin production, assessed by activity of culture super-natants against M. luteus and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The in trans expression of mibX from its native promoter restored microbisporicin production. Regulation of Microbisporicin Production by MibX. Microbisporicin (detected by activity against M. luteus) was first observed after 46\u2013 50 h of growth in medium V supplemented with sucrose and proline (VSP medium), corresponding to midexponential growth phase (Fig. S5A). To assess the potential regulatory role of mibX, RNA was isolated after 48 h and 72 h from the wild-type strain and from the mibA and mibX mutants (Fig. S5B) and analyzed by RT-PCR. To provide an internal standard, we identified a homo-log of the major vegetative \u03c3 factor gene, hrdB, of Streptomyces coelicolor (SCO5820), in the M. corallina 454 sequence data (91% nucleotide identity across 509 nucleotides of C-terminal se-quence). M. corallina hrdB was expressed at roughly equal levels in all three strains (two biological replicates for each strain at both time points) at both 48 h and 72 h of growth (Fig. 5 and Fig. S6A). Expression analysis was carried out using primers listed in Table S3. Of the genes monitored, only orf1 was expressed at approximately equivalent levels in all three strains at both time points; orf1 lies at one end of the cloned M. corallina DNA and does not seem to be cotranscribed with other putative mib genes. Transcription of all of the other genes was reduced in both the mibA and mibX mutants compared with the wild-type strain at both 48 h and 72 h of cultivation (Fig. 5 and Fig. S6A). ThemibA transcript was absent in the mibX mutant, and the mibX tran-script was markedly reduced in the mibA mutant. Thus, both mibA and mibX are required for wild-type expression of the mib genes. The expression patterns of mibYOQRWX (Fig. S6A) in-dicated that they were also likely to be involved in micro-bisporicin biosynthesis. We next analyzed all of the putative intergenic regions (orf 1-mibJ, mibO-mibQ, mibQ-mibR, mibX-mibA, and mibV-mibE) for a consensus sequence using MEME (22). This revealed a con-sensus motif of GAACC-N15-GCTAC for all five sequences (Fig. 2 and Fig. S6). Only the transcription unit starting with mibA lacked the motif. The consensus sequence strongly resembles those of well-characterized ECF \u03c3 factors (AAC in the -35 region and CGT in the -10 region) (23). Together, these results suggest that all of the mib transcription units are cor-egulated by the ECF \u03c3 factor MibX. Discussion Microbisporicin is a highly promising candidate antibiotic for clinical development (4, 5) and as a gene-encoded peptide has significant potential for rational design (1, 6). The identification and characterization of the genes responsible for microbisporicin biosynthesis, and the development of methods for the genetic manipulation of the producing organism, provide the founda-tion for knowledge-based increases in strain productivity and the generation of variants with potentially improved pharma-cological properties. Consequently, the work described here may represent a key milestone in the future clinical use of this potent antibiotic. This study reports the genetic manipulation of a Microbispora strain and analysis of a type AI lantibiotic gene cluster from an actinomycete. Moreover, deletion analysis has identified func-tions for several mib genes. Microbisporicin is unique among lantibiotics and other riboso-mally synthesized peptides in containing a chlorinated tryptophan, and we have identified a flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenase involved in modifying such peptide substrates. MibH shares rela-tively lowaminoacid sequence identitywithotherflavin-dependent halogenases, for example, 24% and 30% with PrnA and PyrH in-volved in pyrollnitrin [Pseudomonas fluorescens (13)] and pyrroin-domycin [Streptomyces rugosporus (8)] production, respectively, whereas the latter two enzymes share 41% identity. This might reflect differences in the type of substrate; whereas PrnAandPyrH act on free tryptophan (8, 13), MibH presumably acts post-translationally on a potentially structured peptide. Future studies of MibH may reveal the structural and sequence differences that discriminate between the two types of substrate and determine how readily MibH can be used to chlorinate other peptides. Deletion of mibV also resulted in the production of non-chlorinated microbisporicin. The presence of potential degradation Fig. 4.

Interaction between MibV and MibH might then be essential for chlorination to occur, explaining the similar mutant phenotypes. mibH and mibV mutants reproducibly exhibited higher than wild-type levels of activity against M. luteus (Fig. 4), suggesting that the nonchlorinated form of microbisporicin might be more active. Although there are conflicting reports about the relative activities of the chlorinated and nonchlorinated forms of the lantibiotic (3\u20135), its unusual activity against some Gram-negative pathogens might reflect increased penetrability, potentially attributable to the increase in net charge that results from chlorination. Hydroxylation of proline-14 of microbisporicin is another unique lantibiotic modification. Cytochrome P450s catalyze the regiospe-cific and stereospecific oxidation of nonactivated hydrocarbons, frequently acting as tailoring enzymes in the biosynthesis of poly-ketides and non\u2013ribosomally synthesized peptides (24). Thus, it seems likely that MibO is responsible for the unique dihydrox-ylation of proline-14 of microbisporicin. The absence of microbisporicin variants in the culture super-natant of the mibD mutant lacking the C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine suggests either that this modification is essential for full maturation or that the peptide is rapidly de-graded in its absence. Interestingly, many lantibiotics possess (methyl-)lanthionine bridges or S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteines at their C termini (1) that might serve to prevent carboxypepti-dase degradation in the external environment. On the basis of homology, MibEF are likely to confer immu-nity to microbisporicin. Deletion of mibEF resulted in very low levels of bioactivity late in growth, potentially reflecting release of the compound by cell lysis in stationary phase. In the absence of MibEF-mediated immunity, the cell may respond by blocking microbisporcin export or even markedly reducing mib gene ex-pression. Alternatively, despite the presence of MibTU, MibEF might be solely responsible for export of microbisporicin. An enzyme responsible for leader peptide cleavage was not identified in the mib cluster. Although many lantibiotic gene clusters encode dedicated extracellular proteases (LanP) that fulfill this role (1, 25), some do not and seem to rely on non-specific proteases for leader peptide cleavage (1, 7). Such pro-teases are involved in maturation of haloduracin (26). This may also be the case for microbisporicin; production of the mature peptide in Nonomuraea is also consistent with a role for a gen-eral protease in leader peptide cleavage. The ECF \u03c3 factor family, to whichMibX belongs, was discovered in S. coelicolor (\u03c3E), but members have since been identified in a wide variety of bacteria. Several mechanisms regulate \u03c3 factor activity (27), including control by anti-\u03c3 factors that sequester the \u03c3 factor, thus preventing transcription initiation from cognate pro-moters until receipt of a specific signal. The putative anti-\u03c3 factor MibW is predicted to be located in the membrane but with a cyto-plasmic N-terminal segment that could interact with and sequester the MibX ECF \u03c3 factor. Indeed, bacterial two-hybrid analysis in E. coli demonstrated strong interaction between MibX and MibW. We suggest a model in which MibX is required for high-level expression of the microbisporicin gene cluster (including its own gene) and in which its activity depends on low levels of pro-duction of microbisporicin. We propose that low levels of micro-bisporicin (potentially produced by expression from a starvation-induced promoter) or cell envelope stress (induced by the likely interaction of microbisporicin with lipid II) prevents MibW from interacting with MibX, thus releasing the ECF \u03c3 factor and resulting in high-level expression of the entire microbisporicin gene cluster. Interestingly, the operon beginning with mibA does not have the consensus motif, suggesting that regulation by MibX might be mediated through a gene in one of the other MibX-regulated operons. A likely candidate for this is mibR, which encodes a protein with a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain. Until now, ECF \u03c3 factors were associated almost exclusively with mediating global or pleiotropic changes in gene expression in response to cell stress or during development (23). Very few examples of pathway-specific ECF \u03c3 factors have been reported and to our knowledge none that specifically regulate antibiotic production. Biosynthesis of sublancin, a type A(II) lantibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis strains that are lysogenic for the SP\u03b2 bacteriophage, is dependent on \u03c3X and, to a lesser extent, \u03c3M. However, this effect is mediated indirectly through the transition state regulator Abh (28). The microbisporcin gene cluster pro-vides an example of the involvement of an ECF \u03c3 factor as a pathway-specific regulator of antibiotic biosynthesis. Experimental Procedures For detailed information, see SI Experimental Procedures. Strains and General Methods.Oligonucleotides and constructs are described in Tables S3 and S4.M. corallina (NRRL 30420) was grown on V0.1 solid medium or in VSP liquid medium (29) (SI Experimental Procedures). Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 was a kind gift from Professor Flavia Marinelli (Universit\u00e0 del-l\u2019Insubria, Varese, Italy) and was grown on V0.1 or in VSP (29) (SI Experi-mental Procedures). Conjugations into Nonomuraea were carried out as in ref. 21. Streptomyces strains were cultured and manipulated as in ref. 30. E. coli was cultured according to (31). Southern analysis was carried out as described in ref. 31 and SI Experimental Procedures. Identification of the mib Gene Cluster. Genomic DNA from M. corallina my-celium was subjected to 454 sequencing (Cogenics). The resulting 3.34 Mb of sequence (with 3,027 contigs >500 nt andmean size 1,117 bp) was interrogated for protein and nucleotide sequences of interest using BlastN and tBlastN, re-spectively (32). Searches were carried out using the amino acid sequences of Fig. 5. RT-PCR analysis of mib gene expression during midexponential growth (48 h) of M. corallina wild type (WT), \u0394mibA::aac(3)IV (\u0394mibA), and \u0394mibX:: aac(3)IV (\u0394mibX). Two samples of RNA were isolated from each strain (shown side by side for each primer set) and used for RT-PCR (primer pairs are listed in Table S3). Primers internal to hrdB of M. corallina were used as a control (Left).

A cosmid library of M. corallina gNDA was constructed and screened for cosmids hybridizing to a 1,250-bp probe spanning mibC-mibD. The sequence of pIJ12125 was de-termined by Sanger sequencing (Cambridge University DNA Sequencing Ser-vice) and annotated using Artemis (Sanger Institute) (9). ORFs were further characterized by homology searches using National Center for Biotechnology Information Blast. Heterologous Expression. pIJ12125 was targeted with a 5,247-bp SspI frag-ment of pIJ10702 (18) as described in ref. 19. The resulting cosmid, pIJ12131, was confirmed by restriction digestion, transferred to E. coli ET12567 pUZ8002 by transformation, and thence into the heterologous host by conjugation. Exconjugants were selected with 50 \u03bcg/mL apramycin. Detection of Microbisporicin. Forty-microliter samples of culture supernatants and controls were applied to antibiotic assay discs, allowed to dry, and placed onto lawns ofM. luteus that were incubated at 30 \u00b0C until halos were visible, usually overnight. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out as de-scribed in SI Experimental Procedures. Manipulation of M. corallina. Conjugation between E. coli ET12567 pUZ8002 carrying the oriT-containing plasmid and M. corallina was carried out as de-scribed in SI Experimental Procedures. To generate deletion mutants, genes in pIJ12125 were replaced with an apramycinR-oriT cassette amplified from pIJ773 using the primer pairs listed in Table S3, as described in ref. 19. Mutations were confirmed by PCR using flanking primers and by restriction digests to confirm the integrity of the cosmid. Mutant cosmids were trans-ferred to E. coli ET12567 pUZ8002 by transformation (31) and the resulting strain conjugated with M. corallina mycelium. Ex-conjugants were selected on V0.1 containing 50 \u03bcg/mL apramycin and subcultured in VSP containing 25 \u03bcg/ mL apramycin for 6 d at 30 \u00b0C before streaking for single colonies on V0.1 containing 50 \u03bcg/mL apramycin. Single colonies were assayed for growth on V0.1 containing 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin. Clones sensitive to kanamycin were cultured in VSP containing 50 \u03bcg/mL apramycin for 6 d at 30 \u00b0C and stored as a master cell bank at -80 \u00b0C. A further subculture was grown in VSP containing 25 \u03bcg/mL apramycin at 30 \u00b0C for 48 h to prepare gDNA, which was analyzed by PCR. Genotypes of clones were further confirmed by Southern hybridization. Complementation was carried out in trans by expressing a wild-type copy of the gene from its native promoter (SI Experimental Procedures). RNA Preparation from M. corallina and RT-PCR. RNA was prepared from M. corallina mycelium grown in liquid VSP medium. Mycelium was lysed in a FastPrep machine (Thermo Scientific) at speed 6.5 for 30 s and RNA puri-fied using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as described in SI Experimental Procedures. RNA concentration and quality were assessed and RT-PCR per-formed as described in SI Experimental Procedures. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

        "Lucy C. Foulston and Mervyn J. Bibb1 John Innes Centre, Norwich NR4 7UH, United Kingdom Communicated by Arnold L. Demain, Drew University, Madison, NJ, June 13, 2010 (received for review April 29, 2010) Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotics. The biosynthetic gene cluster for microbisporicin, a potent lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora corallina containing chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroxyproline residues, was identified by genome scanning and isolated from an M. corallina cosmid library. Heterologous expression in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 confirmed that all of the genes required for microbis-poricin biosynthesis were present in the cluster. Deletion, in M. cor-allina, of the gene (mibA) predicted to encode the prepropeptide abolished microbisporicin production. Further deletion analysis re-vealed insights into the biosynthesis of this unusual and potentially clinically useful lantibiotic, shedding light on mechanisms of regula-tion and self-resistance. In particular, we report an example of the involvement of a tryptophan halogenase in the modification of a ribosomally synthesized peptide and the pathway-specific regula-tion of an antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster by an extracytoplasmic function \u03c3 factor\u2013anti-\u03c3 factor complex. antibiotic | extracytoplasmic function | halogenase | Microbispora | peptide | \u03c3 factor",

        "teria. They are characterized by lanthionine and methyl lanthio-nine bridges that give lantibiotics their characteristic conforma-tions and stability (1).",
        "Lantibiotics are encoded by a structural gene (generically named lanA) that encodes a prepropeptide with an N-terminal leader peptide followed by the region that will become the ma-ture lantibiotic (the propeptide). The prepropeptide undergoes modification and processing before the mature product is exported from the cell, coincident with, or followed by, leader peptide removal. The N-terminal leader sequence may have roles in directing export, retaining the prelantibiotic in an in-active state until export and recruiting modifying enzymes (1).",
        "Formation of lanthionine bridges occurs via the dehydration of serine and threonine residues, followed by cyclization with cys-teine residues. In type AI lantibiotics (e.g., nisin), dehydration is carried out by a LanB enzyme and cyclization by LanC. In type AII (e.g., lacticin 481) and B (e.g., cinnamycin) lantibiotics, a bifunctional LanM carries out both of these reactions. For-mation of C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine requires a LanD enzyme. Additional genes, such as those involved in pathway-specific regulation, lantibiotic export, and producer cell immunity, are also found in lantibiotic gene clusters (1).",
        "Strains of the species Microbispora corallina (2) produce a group of potent bactericidal lantibiotic variants collectively named microbisporicin (3\u20135) (Fig. 1A). Microbisporicin has one methyllanthionine and three lanthionine bridges and an S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine at its C terminus. It also con-tains two unusual lantibiotic modifications: 5-chlorotryptophan and 3, 4-dihydroxyproline (4, 5).",
        "The increasing incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial patho-gens has resulted in an urgent need for new, clinically useful antibiotics. Microbisporicin is active against a wide range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, selectively inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus megaterium, prob-",
        "ably by binding to the immediate precursor for cell wall bio-synthesis, lipid II (4, 5). It is active against methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-intermediate resistant strains of S. aureus and, un-usually for a lantibiotic, also against some Gram-negative species (4, 5). Microbisporicin, under the commercial name NAI-107, is currently in late preclinical-phase trials and has demonstrated superior efficacy in animal models of multidrug resistant infec-tions compared with the drugs of last resort, linezolid and vanco-mycin.* Interestingly, no microbisporicin-resistant mutants were observed during these studies.\u2020 Understanding how microbis-poricin is made could enable the development of variants with improved clinical activity. Few examples of actinomycete lantibiotic gene clusters exist. Those that do (cinnamycin and actagardine) belong to type B lantibiotics (6, 7). Our aim was to clone and characterize the type AI microbisporicin biosynthetic gene cluster from M. corallina NRRL 30420 and to develop M. corallina as a genetic system in which targeted mutagenesis could be performed to elucidate the functions of individual genes. There were no reported methods by which M. corallina, a so-called rare actinomycete, could be transformed with DNA, and only a few reports of transformation in the Streptosporangiaceae, the family to which M. corallina belongs. To complement genetic analysis in M. corallina, we also set out to express the microbisporicin gene cluster in a heterol-ogous host and to define the minimal gene set required for microbisporicin production. Results Identification of the Microbisporicin Gene Cluster by Genome Scanning. Genome scanning was used to identify genes from the micro-bisporicin gene cluster. M. corallina genomic DNA (gDNA) was subjected to 454 sequencing (Cogenics), yielding 4.6 Mb of se-quence on 7,580 assembled contigs. Sequence analysis identified a contig encoding homologs of LanC and LanD proteins from other lantibiotic gene clusters. Other contigs encoded proteins homologous to the prepropeptide (LanA) of microbisporicin [deduced from the NMR structure of microbisporcin (4, 5)], a putative lantibiotic dehydratase (LanB), and a tryptophan hal-ogenase [with homology to PyrH from Streptomyces rugosporus (8)]. Many of these fragments were bridged by PCR amplification",

Primers LF001F and LF004R were used to amplify an \u22481,250-bp probe from the lanC-lanD region that was hybridized to an Escherichia coli cosmid library ofM. corallina gDNA to identify clones containing the microbisporicin gene cluster. Six cosmids were identified, five of which were shown by PCR and restriction mapping to contain all of the previously identified contigs. One of the cosmids, pIJ12125, was sequenced.

        "mis (9); Fig. 2 and Table S2], the products of which are de-scribed below. MibA is the 57-aa prepropeptide of microbisporicin, with a leader sequence extending from residues 1 to 33. The propeptide sequence agrees with the published NMR structure of micro-bisporicin (Fig. 1B) (4, 5). Alignment of the putative leader pep-tide with those of other lantibiotics, such as nisin, gallidermin, and epidermin, revealed a possibly conserved \u201cFNLD\u201d motif (LDLD in microbisporicin; Fig. 1B) potentially involved in processing (10). The MibA cleavage site resembles those of other type AI lantibiotics (Fig. 1B), with proline at the -2 position and alanine at -4 (1).mibA seems to be at the start of an operon that contains modification and export genes. A 247-bp gap lies between the 5\u2032 end ofmibA and the preceding oppositely transcribed gene mibX and presumably contains the mibA promoter, whereas 117 bp of noncoding sequence between mibA and mibB might reflect the presence of a transcriptional attenuator. Indeed, an RNA sec-ondary structure (\u0394G= -123 kJ mol-1) was predicted for region 8,820\u20138,854 bp using Clone Manager 6 (Scientific & Educational Software; Fig. 2). Such structures occur in other lantibiotic gene clusters and are thought to maintain an appropriate stoichiometry between the prepropeptide and the modification enzymes (11). MibB is a homolog of lantibiotic dehydratases (LanBs). Closest relatives are LanB-like proteins from Bacillus clausii, as well as other actinomycetes, such as Streptomyces noursei and Strepto-myces griseus (both with 34% identity), that are not known tomake lantibiotics. Homologs from well-studied lantibiotics include SpaB (subtilin), EpiB (epidermin), andMutB (mutacin III).MibB is likely to dehydrate serine and threonine residues in the pre-propeptide to yield didehydroalanine and didehydrobutyrine, re-spectively. MibC shows homology to lantibiotic cyclases (LanCs), including SpaC (subtilin), EpiC (epidermin), and MutC (mutacin III), and is likely to be involved in forming the (methyl-)lanthio-nine bridges of microbisporicin. MibD is homologous to fla-voproteins, specifically those involved in S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine formation, such as MrsD (mersacidin) and MutD (mutacin III). LanDs decarboxylate the C-terminal cysteine of the peptide chain to yield a free thiol group that subsequently forms a lanthionine bridge via cyclization with a propeptide dehydrated serine or threonine, a reaction likely catalyzed by LanC (1). MibD is presumably involved in formation of the S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine moiety at the C terminus of microbisporicin (4, 5). MibT belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, whereas MibU is homologous to ABC-transporter per-meases. MibTU are close homologs of a two-component ABC transporter, CinTH, likely involved in cinnamycin export (7), and probably play a similar role in microbisporicin secretion. MibV is a hypothetical protein with few homologs, the closest",

        "MibR, MibW, and MibX all seem to be regulatory proteins. MibR possesses a helix-turn-helix domain found in the LuxR family of regulatory proteins. MibX belongs to the extrac-ytoplasmic function (ECF) family of \u03c3 factors, sharing 49% and 43% amino acid identity with putative ECF \u03c3 factors from Streptosporangium roseum DSM43021 (Sros_1172) and Frankia sp. EAN1pec (Franean1_3991), respectively. Additionally, MibX shares 27% identity with CnrH, an ECF \u03c3 factor regulating co-balt and nickel resistance in Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 (previously Ralstonia metallidurans CH34) (16). ECF \u03c3 factors are a subgroup of RNA polymerase \u03c3 factors that respond to extracellular signals (e.g., membrane stress) by directing RNA polymerase to particular promoter sequences. mibW, down-stream of and apparently translationally coupled to mibX, enc-odes a protein with low levels of similarity to putative anti-\u03c3 factors believed to interact with homologs of MibX; MibW homologs occur in S. roseum DSM43021 (Sros_1171) and Frankia sp. EAN1pec (Franean1_3992), sharing 20% and 18% identity with MibW, respectively. MibW is predicted to have six transmembrane helices and to be embedded in the membrane, with a 73-aa cytoplasmic N-terminal region [TMHMM v.2 (17)]. This, as well as the proximity of mibW to mibX, suggests that MibW acts as an anti-\u03c3 factor to suppress MibX activity. Heterologous Expression of the mib Gene Cluster. An \u22485-kb SspI fragment of pIJ10702 (18), containing the apramycin resistance gene, the\u03a6C31 integrase gene and corresponding attB site, and an E. coli origin of transfer was used to replace the kanamycin re-sistance gene of the SuperCos vector backbone of pIJ12125 by PCR-targeting (19), yielding pIJ12131. Transfer of pIJ12131 to several Streptomyces species failed to result in microbisporicin production. Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 belongs to the same family as Microbispora, the Streptosporangiaceae, and produces",
        "the glycopeptide antibiotic A40926 (20). pIJ12131 was transfer-red intoNonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 by conjugation from E. coli ET12567 pUZ8002 and integration at the \u03a6C31 attachment site (21) confirmed by PCR. Whereas the culture supernatant from a representative exconjugant clearly inhibited growth of Micro-coccus luteus (Fig. 3), those from wild-type Nonomuraea and a vector-only control did not. Production of microbisporicin was confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis of the same culture super-natant (Fig. S1). Thus, all of the genes required for micro-bisporicin production lie within the 36,668-bp insert of pIJ12131. Generation of a mibA Deletion Mutant. A method for the genetic manipulation of M. corallina was developed (SI Results; Fig. S2). mibA of pIJ12125 (which confers kanamycin resistance) was replaced with an apramycin resistance cassette [aac(3)IV] by PCR targeting. The resulting construct was introduced into M. corallina by conjugation from ET12567 pUZ8002 and excon-jugants selected using apramycin. Double-crossover recombinants in whichmibA was replaced by the mutant allele were identified by their apramycin-resistant and kanamycin-sensitive phenotypes and confirmed as \u0394mibA::aac(3)IV by Southern hybridization using pIJ12125 as probe. M. corallina \u0394mibA::aac(3)IV and the parental strain were grown for 7 d in liquid culture. In contrast to the wild-type strain, culture supernatant from the \u0394mibA mutant failed to inhibit M. luteus (Fig. 4), and no microbisporicin was detected by MALDI-TOF analysis (Fig. S3). Thus, mibA is essential for microbisporicin biosynthesis in M. corallina, confirming the iden-tity of the gene cluster. Deletion Analysis. Deletion mutants were similarly generated in M. corallina for mibD, mibTU, mibEF, mibN, mibH, mibV, and mibX. An \u22487-kb segment downstream of mibN was also replaced with the apramycin cassette. Mutations were confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization. Unless stated otherwise, at least two independent clones for each mutant were analyzed and compared with the wild-type strain using bioassays against M. luteus (Fig. 4) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S3) of supernatants from 7-d cultures. Deletion of the 7-kb segment had no effect on microbisporicin production, thus defining the right-hand boundary of the bio-synthetic gene cluster. Deletion of mibD resulted in loss of bio-activity and disappearance of MALDI-TOF peaks associated with the microbisporicin complex. Microbisporicin production was re-stored to wild-type levels by the in trans expression of mibD from themibA promoter (likely to be its native promoter). Surprisingly, deletion of mibTU (only one clone tested) had no effect on microbisporicin production when assessed by both bioassay and",

Deletion of mibN also had no apparent effect on microbisporicin production. In contrast, deletion of mibEF resulted in markedly delayed and greatly reduced levels of microbisporicin production. Whereas supernatants from 3-to 5-d cultures failed (unlike the wild type) to inhibit M. luteus, those from 7-d cultures gave a small zone of in-hibition. Mass spectrometry revealed small amounts of the micro-bisporicin complex in the 7-d culture supernatants.

Expression in trans ofmibHS from themibEF promoter (likely to be the native promoter) revealed masses attributable to both the chlorinated and nonchlorinated forms of microbisporicin. Thus, MibH seems to be the halogenase responsible for chlorination of microbisporicin. Deletion of mibV yielded essentially the same results. However, MALDI-TOF analysis of culture supernatants of three independent mibV mutants revealed additional com-pounds with masses lower than those of BA-1768\u03b21 that may be microbisporicin degradation products.",

Microbisporicin (detected by activity against M. luteus) was first observed after 46\u2013 50 h of growth in medium V supplemented with sucrose and proline (VSP medium), corresponding to midexponential growth phase (Fig. S5A). To assess the potential regulatory role of mibX,",
        "RNA was isolated after 48 h and 72 h from the wild-type strain and from the mibA and mibX mutants (Fig. S5B) and analyzed by RT-PCR. To provide an internal standard, we identified a homo-log of the major vegetative \u03c3 factor gene, hrdB, of Streptomyces coelicolor (SCO5820), in the M. corallina 454 sequence data (91% nucleotide identity across 509 nucleotides of C-terminal se-quence). M. corallina hrdB was expressed at roughly equal levels in all three strains (two biological replicates for each strain at both time points) at both 48 h and 72 h of growth (Fig. 5 and Fig. S6A). Expression analysis was carried out using primers listed in Table S3. Of the genes monitored, only orf1 was expressed at approximately equivalent levels in all three strains at both time points; orf1 lies at one end of the cloned M. corallina DNA and does not seem to be cotranscribed with other putative mib genes. Transcription of all of the other genes was reduced in both the mibA and mibX mutants compared with the wild-type strain at both 48 h and 72 h of cultivation (Fig. 5 and Fig. S6A). ThemibA transcript was absent in the mibX mutant, and the mibX tran-script was markedly reduced in the mibA mutant. Thus, both mibA and mibX are required for wild-type expression of the mib genes. The expression patterns of mibYOQRWX (Fig. S6A) in-dicated that they were also likely to be involved in micro-bisporicin biosynthesis. We next analyzed all of the putative intergenic regions (orf 1-mibJ, mibO-mibQ, mibQ-mibR, mibX-mibA, and mibV-mibE) for a consensus sequence using MEME (22). This revealed a con-sensus motif of GAACC-N15-GCTAC for all five sequences (Fig. 2 and Fig. S6). Only the transcription unit starting with mibA lacked the motif. The consensus sequence strongly resembles those of well-characterized ECF \u03c3 factors (AAC in the -35 region and CGT in the -10 region) (23). Together, these results suggest that all of the mib transcription units are cor-egulated by the ECF \u03c3 factor MibX. Discussion Microbisporicin is a highly promising candidate antibiotic for clinical development (4, 5) and as a gene-encoded peptide has significant potential for rational design (1, 6). The identification and characterization of the genes responsible for microbisporicin biosynthesis, and the development of methods for the genetic manipulation of the producing organism, provide the founda-tion for knowledge-based increases in strain productivity and the generation of variants with potentially improved pharma-cological properties. Consequently, the work described here may represent a key milestone in the future clinical use of this potent antibiotic. This study reports the genetic manipulation of a Microbispora strain and analysis of a type AI lantibiotic gene cluster from an actinomycete. Moreover, deletion analysis has identified func-tions for several mib genes. Microbisporicin is unique among lantibiotics and other riboso-mally synthesized peptides in containing a chlorinated tryptophan, and we have identified a flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenase involved in modifying such peptide substrates. MibH shares rela-tively lowaminoacid sequence identitywithotherflavin-dependent halogenases, for example, 24% and 30% with PrnA and PyrH in-volved in pyrollnitrin [Pseudomonas fluorescens (13)] and pyrroin-domycin [Streptomyces rugosporus (8)] production, respectively, whereas the latter two enzymes share 41% identity. This might reflect differences in the type of substrate; whereas PrnAandPyrH act on free tryptophan (8, 13), MibH presumably acts post-translationally on a potentially structured peptide. Future studies of MibH may reveal the structural and sequence differences that discriminate between the two types of substrate and determine how readily MibH can be used to chlorinate other peptides. Deletion of mibV also resulted in the production of non-chlorinated microbisporicin. The presence of potential degradation",

        "products in the mibV mutant might reflect a role for MibV during peptide maturation, perhaps acting as a scaffold or chaperone. Interaction between MibV and MibH might then be essential for chlorination to occur, explaining the similar mutant phenotypes. mibH and mibV mutants reproducibly exhibited higher than wild-type levels of activity against M. luteus (Fig. 4), suggesting that the nonchlorinated form of microbisporicin might be more active. Although there are conflicting reports about the relative activities of the chlorinated and nonchlorinated forms of the lantibiotic (3\u20135), its unusual activity against some Gram-negative pathogens might reflect increased penetrability, potentially attributable to the increase in net charge that results from chlorination.",
        "Hydroxylation of proline-14 of microbisporicin is another unique lantibiotic modification. Cytochrome P450s catalyze the regiospe-cific and stereospecific oxidation of nonactivated hydrocarbons, frequently acting as tailoring enzymes in the biosynthesis of poly-ketides and non\u2013ribosomally synthesized peptides (24). Thus, it seems likely that MibO is responsible for the unique dihydrox-ylation of proline-14 of microbisporicin.",
        "The absence of microbisporicin variants in the culture super-natant of the mibD mutant lacking the C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine suggests either that this modification is essential for full maturation or that the peptide is rapidly de-graded in its absence. Interestingly, many lantibiotics possess (methyl-)lanthionine bridges or S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteines at their C termini (1) that might serve to prevent carboxypepti-dase degradation in the external environment.",
        "On the basis of homology, MibEF are likely to confer immu-nity to microbisporicin. Deletion of mibEF resulted in very low levels of bioactivity late in growth, potentially reflecting release of the compound by cell lysis in stationary phase. In the absence of MibEF-mediated immunity, the cell may respond by blocking microbisporcin export or even markedly reducing mib gene ex-pression. Alternatively, despite the presence of MibTU, MibEF might be solely responsible for export of microbisporicin.",
        "An enzyme responsible for leader peptide cleavage was not identified in the mib cluster. Although many lantibiotic gene clusters encode dedicated extracellular proteases (LanP) that fulfill this role (1, 25), some do not and seem to rely on non-specific proteases for leader peptide cleavage (1, 7). Such pro-teases are involved in maturation of haloduracin (26). This may also be the case for microbisporicin; production of the mature peptide in Nonomuraea is also consistent with a role for a gen-eral protease in leader peptide cleavage.",

The putative anti-\u03c3 factor MibW is predicted to be located in the membrane but with a cyto-plasmic N-terminal segment that could interact with and sequester the MibX ECF \u03c3 factor. Indeed, bacterial two-hybrid analysis in E. coli demonstrated strong interaction between MibX and MibW. We suggest a model in which MibX is required for high-level expression of the microbisporicin gene cluster (including its own gene) and in which its activity depends on low levels of pro-duction of microbisporicin. We propose that low levels of micro-bisporicin (potentially produced by expression from a starvation-induced promoter) or cell envelope stress (induced by the likely interaction of microbisporicin with lipid II) prevents MibW from interacting with MibX, thus releasing the ECF \u03c3 factor and resulting in high-level expression of the entire microbisporicin gene cluster. Interestingly, the operon beginning with mibA does not have the consensus motif, suggesting that regulation by MibX might be mediated through a gene in one of the other MibX-regulated operons. A likely candidate for this is mibR, which encodes a protein with a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain. Until now, ECF \u03c3 factors were associated almost exclusively with mediating global or pleiotropic changes in gene expression in response to cell stress or during development (23). Very few examples of pathway-specific ECF \u03c3 factors have been reported and to our knowledge none that specifically regulate antibiotic production. Biosynthesis of sublancin, a type A(II) lantibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis strains that are lysogenic for the SP\u03b2 bacteriophage, is dependent on \u03c3X and, to a lesser extent, \u03c3M. However, this effect is mediated indirectly through the transition state regulator Abh (28). The microbisporcin gene cluster pro-vides an example of the involvement of an ECF \u03c3 factor as a pathway-specific regulator of antibiotic biosynthesis.
