ATCC33076 Jun-Sheng Chen1,2,3 & Min Su2 & Lei Shao2 & Yuan-Xi Wang2 & Hui-Min Lin2 & Dai-Jie Chen2 Received: 10 July 2015 /Revised: 17 August 2015 /Accepted: 15 September 2015 /Published online: 8 October 2015 # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015 Abstract Ramoplanin and enduracidin are lipopeptide anti-biotics effective against Gram-positive pathogens, which share close similarity in structure and biosynthetic pathway. Both compounds have chlorine atoms attached to 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Hpg) but with different chlorinating sites and levels. Here, to probe the factor affecting the site and level of halogenation, gene inactivation and heterologous expression were carried out in Actinoplanes sp. ATCC33076 by homologous recombination.Metabolite analysis confirmed that ram20 encodes the only halogenase in ramoplanin bio-synthetic pathway, and enduracidin halogenase End30 could heterologously complement the ram20-deficient mutant. Ad-ditionally, the mannosyltransferase-deficient mutant produces a dichlorinated ramoplanin aglycone with the halogenation site at Hpg13. This study has refined our understanding of how halogenation occurs in ramoplanin biosynthetic pathway, and lays the foundation for further exploitation of ramoplanin and enduracidin halogenase in combinatorial biosynthesis. Keywords Antibiotics . Enduracidin . Halogenase . Biosynthesis . Ramoplanin Introduction Ramoplanin A2 (1) is a potent antimicrobial agent pro-duced by Actinoplanes sp. ATCC33076 and is active against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. (VRE), methicillin-r e s i s t an t S taphy lococcus aureus (MRSA) , and vancomycin-intermediate resistant Clostridium difficile (Rolston et al. 1996; Finegold et al. 2004; Pelaez et al. 2005). Structurally, ramoplanin is a macrocycle consisting of 17 amino acids and has a single chlorine atom attached to the 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Hpg)17 (Fig. 1) . Ramoplanin acts as an inhibitor of peptidoglycan formation, thus disrupting the biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall and eventually causes cell death (Lo et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2003). Due to the novel antimicrobial mechanism, no clinical resis-tance to ramoplanin was reported since the discovery of ramoplanin. Ramoplanin is now in phase III clinical trials for C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) in gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Paknikar and Narayana 2012). The biosynthetic gene cluster has been isolated and reported, and the assembly of the peptide core as well as the biosynthesis pathway of the non-proteingenic amino acid were elucidated (McCafferty et al. 2002; Hoertz et al. 2012). Among the gene clusters, ram20 was predicted to encode the only halogenase responsi-ble for introducing the single chlorine atom onto the Hpg17. Enduracidin (5) is a lipodepsipeptide antibiotic closely re-lated to ramoplanin (Fig. 1). It shares similarity in structure and mechanism of action with ramoplanin. Enduracidin con-tains six Hpg residues at the same position as its counterpart and has one chlorinated Hpg.

Halogenation is a frequent modification in the biosynthesis of natural products. To date, over 4000 halogenated natural products have been reported (Gribble 2010). Halogen atoms may profoundly influence the activity of these compounds (Harris et al. 1985; Bister et al. 2003; Eust\u00e1quio et al. 2003). The halogenation strategies in natural product biosynthesis were well reviewed before (Neumann et al. 2008; Butler and Sandy 2009; Wagner et al. 2009). FADH2-dependent halogenase is frequently found in nonribosomal peptide syn-thetase (NRPS)/PKS biosynthetic clusters and is responsible for halogenating bacterially derived secondary metabolites in-cluding ramoplanin and enduracidin. Characterization of the mechanism of chlorination, including timing and substrate specificity, is critical for utilizing halogenase to expand the diversification of these biologically important compounds. In this work, we inactivated the ram20 in the ramoplanin-producing strain Actinoplanes sp. ATCC33076 and subsequent complementary was carried out as well as the heterologous expression of enduracidin halogenase in ramoplanin-producing strain and its derivatives to assess the involvement of the halogenase in the ramoplanin biosynthesis pathway. Materials and methods Bacterial strains, plasmids, and reagents Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1. Plasmid-bearing cultures were supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. Biochemicals, chemicals, media, re-striction enzymes, and other molecular biological reagents were from commercial sources. DNA isolation, manipulations, and sequencing General DNA isolation and manipulation were performed ac-cording to the standard methods (Kieser et al. 2000; Sambrook and Russell 2001). PCR reactions were performed with either Taq or PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (Takara) using geno-mic DNA as templates. Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by Invitrogen, Shanghai, China. Construction of the ram20 inactivation mutant The ram20 in-frame deleted plasmid pCJS3003 was con-structed by cloning two homologous exchange arms corre-sponding to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions flanking ram20 into the shuttle vector pKC1139. The 1.5-kb 5\u2032 fragment was ampli-f ied wi th pr imers 5 \u2032 -AAAAAGCTTCGGCTACC TGATGGAC-3 \u2032 and 5 \u2032 -AAATCTAGAGAGTTCG AGCAGCGCTAC-3\u2032 using ATCC33076 genomic DNA as a template. The purified PCR product was then digested with HindIII and XbaI and then inserted into appropriately digested pSP72 to yield plasmid pCJS3001. The 1.4-kb 3\u2032 flanking DNA fragment was amplified using primers 5 \u2032-A AATCTAGACCGGATCTGGCCGTAGTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-A AAGATATCTGCGGGTCATCGTGGT-3\u2032 and cloned into the XbaI and EcoRV sites of pSP72 to generate pCJS3002. The identity of the fragments was verified by sequencing. The 1.5-kb HindIII/XbaI fragment and 1.5-kb XbaI/EcoRV frag-ment were then excised from pCJS3001 and pCJS3002, O H N N H H N N H H N O O O O O OH OH OH NH NH2 OH O NH O CO2H O O N H H N N H H N O O O O OH OH ClCl OH NH OH NH HN O O N H NH2 O N H NH NH NH HN N H O HO O O HN NH HN O H N N H H N N H H N O O O O O OH OH OH NH NH2 OH O NH O O O N H H N N H H N O O O O OH OR1 OH NH OH NH HN O O NH2 NH HN N H O HO O O H2N O R2 OC NH2 Hpg11Hpg13 Hpg17 Hpg3 Hpg6 Hpg7 Hpg13 Hpg11 Hpg17 Hpg3 Hpg6 Hpg7 D-Ala16 D-Ala16 Gly14 Gly14 Leu15 End15 D-aThr12 D-Ser12 D-Orn10 Phe9 aThr8 D-aThr5 D-Orn4 OHAsn2 Asn1 Asp1 Thr2 D-Orn4 D-aThr5 aThr8 Cit9 D-End10 R3 Fig. 1 Structures of ramoplanins and enduracidin A 290 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:289\u2013298 respectively, and inserted into the pKC1139 prepared by di-gestion with HindIII and EcoRV to construct the in-frame inactivated plasmid pCJS3003. The resultant plasmid pCJS3003 was then introduced into ATCC33076 from Escherichia coli ET12567 by intergeneric conjugation ac-cording to the standard procedure (Kieser et al. 2000). One of the AmR transconjugants was streaked on the mannitol soya flour (MS) agar (Kieser et al. 2000) containing 50 \u03bcg/ml Am at 37 \u00b0C to induce integration of the plasmid to the chromo-some. One colony in which integration had taken place was further cultured at 30 \u00b0C and 250 rpm for 2 days in 3-ml liquid TSB medium for five rounds in the absence of apramycin to induce the second crossover. The resulting apramycin-sensitive colonies were further screened by PCR with primers 5\u2032-CCAAGGCCGGGTTCATGCGCAAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GC CGGAGGCGATGCCGCCGACCAACTC-3\u2032, and the geno-type was confirmed by sequencing. Self-complementation of the ram20-deficient mutant The DNA sequence encoding ram20 was amplified from the genomic DNA of ATCC33076 using primers 5\u2032-AAA GGATCCGTGGCTGCTCAACCGGAAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AAA TCTAGATCAGTCGGCGGCGACCCACG-3\u2032. The gel-purified PCR product was then digested and cloned into pSP72 to give the plasmid pCJS3004. The identity of PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Together with the 0.5-kb EcoRI/BamHI digested PermE* fragment, the 1.5-kb BamHI/XbaI ram20 fragment was inserted into the integra-tive vector pSET152 prepared byEcoRI andXbaI to afford the self-complemented plasmid pCJS3005. This plasmid was then introduced into A.CJS3001 by intergeneric conjugation from E. coli ET12567. The genotype of the resulting Am-resistant mutants was further confirmed by PCR using the primers 5\u2032-C GCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3\u2032 (M13-47) and 5\u2032-G AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3\u2032 (RV-M), yielding the ram20 self-complemented strain A.CJS3002. Heterologous expression of enduracidin halogenase end30 in ATCC33076 and its derivatives The enduracidin halogenase end30 was PCR amplified with primers 5 \u2032-AAAGGATCCGTGCCGGGAGGC CGAATGAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AAATCTAGATCAGGACGGAT GCGGCTCC-3\u2032 from the genomic DNA of ATCC21013, and the product was gel purified and cloned into pSP72 to give the plasmid pCJS3006.

The resultant plasmid pCJS3007 was intro-duced either into the ram20-deficient mutant strains or the wild-type strain ATCC33076 by intergenic conjugation to construct enduracidin halogenase into heterologously complemented strains or heterologously expressed strains, respectively. The genotype of the resultant mutants was confirmed by PCR using the primers RV-M and M13-47. Assay of end30 transcription by reverse transcription PCR Total RNA of ATCC33076 and its derivatives was extract-ed from mycelia grown in fermentation medium for 96 h using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). DNase I treatment and cDNA preparation were carried out using the Takara PrimeScript RT reagent kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. One NRPS gene ram13 involved in the biosynthesis of ramoplanin was taken as an internal control, and the 279-bp internal fragment was amplified using primers 5\u2032-AT GCTCCGGTTCACG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTAGGCGCTCTGGTT-3\u2032. For evaluation of the transcriptional level of introduced end30, a 262-bp internal fragment was amplified using primers 5\u2032-AGCACGGACTTCGACCTCTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CC CAGAACATGCTGTCGGAC-3\u2032. Production and preparation of ramoplanin and its derivatives Actinoplanes strains were grown on 28 \u00b0C on agar plates consisting of 0.3 % beef extract, 1 % tryptone, 2.4 % corn starch, 0.1 % glucose, and 2.2 % agar, pH 7.0. Apramycin was used at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml for selection. For fermentation, the mycelium from agar plate was inoc-ulated into seed medium (0.3 % beef extract, 0.5 % tryptone, 0.5 % yeast extract, 3 % oat meal, 0.4 % CaCO3, pH 7.0), cultured at 28 \u00b0C and 250 rpm for 3 days, trans-ferred (1:10 v/v) into production medium (5 % soluble starch, 2 % glucose, 3 % soya flour, 1 % CaCO3, and 0.5 % leucine, pH 7.0), and incubated at 25 \u00b0C and 250 rpm for 6 days. The fermentation broth was adjusted to pH 3.0 with HCl and centrifuged to remove the super-natant. Then, the mycelia were extracted with an equal volume of acetone for 3 h. The suspension was then cen-trifuged, and the supernatant was collected and concentrat-ed under vacuum to yield the crude extracts for further analysis. HPLC analysis of ramoplanin and its derivatives HPLC was performed using a Thermo Syncronis C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 250\u00d74.6 mm) on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system. For ramoplanin analysis, an isocratic elution system consisting of 35 % CH3CN and 65 % H2O (0.4 % ammonium formate) was applied, at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, with 231 nm monitored. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) anal-yses were performed on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Fleet system equipped with an Agilent 1100 HPLC system and under the control of Xcalibur 2.0.6, with the same conditions mentioned above for HPLC, and the positive mode electrospray ioniza-tion was used for MS detection. MS/MS analyses were performed on ACQUITY UPLC and Q-TOF MS Premier by Instrumental Analysis Center of Shanghai Jiaotong University. An MS/MS scan was carried out by selecting the five most intense ions as the parent ion for analysis with the collision energy of 30 eV. The data were collect and processed using the MassLynx Software. Evaluation of antibacterial activity Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of ramoplanin and its derivatives against Bacillus subtilis was determined using a disk diffusion method. Ramoplanin standards and analogues were dissolved in 50 % MeOH at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml, and 100 \u03bcl of each solution was loaded onto the filter paper disk. After incubating the plates at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h, the zones of inhibition were observed and compared and the plates were photographed. Results Generation of the ram20 in-frame inactivated mutant The biosynthetic gene cluster of ramoplanin has already been reported, and the ram20 was annotated as the single halogenase. It was predicted to be responsible for the intro-duction of the chlorine atom to the Hpg17 residue. In order to experimentally assess the in vivo function of ram20, a ram20 in-frame deleted mutant was constructed by double-crossover homologous recombination and designated as A.CJS3001. A 192-bp fragment in the middle of ram20 was chosen to be deleted to inactivate the Ram20 while avoiding its effects on the transcription of downstream genes. The genotype of the resultant ram20 in-frame inactivated mutants was confirmed by PCR and sequencing (Fig. 2b). After 6-day fermentation, metabolites produced by A.CJS3001 were extracted from the mycelia and analyzed on LC-MS. LC-MS analysis re-vealed that, comparing with the parent strain ATCC33076, the mutant strain A.CJS3001 produced no ramoplanin A2 (1, m/z ([M+2H]2+)=1278) but accumulated deschloro-292 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:289\u2013298 ramoplanin A2 (2, m/z [M+2H]2+)=1260 (Figs. 3b and 4a), indicating that the Ram20-halogenated ramoplanin. Self-complementation of the ram20 in-frame deleted mutant To further confirm that the ram20 is the only halogenase gene in the ramoplanin biosynthesis pathway, a ram20 self-complemented strain was constructed. A 1.5-kb DNA fragment coding the intact ram20 was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of ATCC33076 and then inserted downstream of PermE* in pSET152 to yield the heterologously expressed plasmid pCJS3005. pCJS3005 was then introduced into the ram20 in-frame deleted mu-tant A.CJS3001, and the transconjugants were screened on the basis of apramycin resistance to yield the ram20 self-complemented strain A.CJS3002. PCR analysis of the genomic DNAs from the recombinant strains confirmed that they have the designed genotypes (Fig. 2b). The complemented strain was fermented, and the metabolite was analyzed by LC-MS. The results showed that the self-complemented strain produces a metabolite with m/ z=1278.1 (Fig. 3c), which is consistent with the molecu-lar formula C119H154ClN21O40 for ramoplanin A2. Taken together, these results confirm that the ram20 encodes the only halogenase in the ramoplanin biosynthesis pathway. Heterologous complementation of the ram20 deletion mutant with the enduracidin halogenase end30 Enduracidin shares great similarity in structure with ramoplanin, and enduracidin halogenase showed 62 % amino acid identity with Ram20; thus, it may be able to halogenate the macrocycle of ramoplanin. To validate this hypothesis, enduracidin halogenase was heterologously expressed in A.CJS3001. For heterologous expression of enduracidin halogenase end30, a 1.5-kb DNA fragment encodes the intact end30 that was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of ATCC21013 and then inserted down-stream of PermE* in pSET152 to give the heterologously expressed plasmid pCJS3007. The heterologously complemented mutant A.CJS3003 was obtained by intro-ducing pCJS3007 into A.CJS3002, and PCR analysis con-firmed the genotype of the mutant. Compared with the parent strain, HPLC and LC-MS analysis of the metabolite reveal m/z ([M+2H]2+)=1278.1 which is consistent with ramoplanin A2 (Fig. 3d). This indicates the heterologously expressed end30 could halo-genate the ramoplanin macrocycle.

All PCR products were sequenced to confirm each mutation. c RT-PCR analysis of the transcription level of the NRPS ram13 gene and the heterologously expressed end30 gene in A.CJS3003 and A.CJS3004. In both heterologously expressed strains, enduracidin halogenase was transcribed in a comparable level Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:289\u2013298 293 residues in the ramoplanin macrocycle that could be halo-genated, Yin et al. (2010) demonstrated that the End-orf30 di-halogenates the Hpg13 of enduracidin in the enduracidin biosynthesis pathway and it is necessary to identify the site on which the chlorine atom was introduced by the heterol-ogously expressed halogenase. Ramoplanins were subject-ed to the MS/MS analysis. In the spectra of ramoplanin A2 MS/MS analysis, a series of ions are observed for fragment peptide Gly14-Cl-Hpg17 (m/z 443.9), D-aThr12-Cl-Hpg17 (m/z 694.2), and D-Orn10-Cl-Hpg17 (m/z 957.4) (Fig. 5a). Analysis of the MS/MS spectra for the peptide produced by A.CJS3003 revealed ions at m/z 443.9 and 694.2, corre-sponding to the addition of a single chlorine atom to Hpg17, which suggests that the enduracidin halogenase could be capable of heterologously complementing the Ram20-deficient mutant. Heterologous expressing End-orf30 in ATCC33076 and metabolite analysis To further investigate the involvement of the enduracidin halogenase in the ramoplanin biosynthesis pathway, we also introduced the plasmid pCJS3007 to the wild-type ramoplanin-producing strain ATCC33076. The integration of the end30 into the chromosome of ATCC33076 was con-firmed by PCR (Fig. 2b). The resulting strain was designated A.CJS3004. The mutant was fermented, and the metabolites were subjected to HPLC and LC-MS analysis, but no new Fig. 3 LC-ESI-MS analysis of the metabolites produced by a ATCC33076, b A.CJS3001, c A.CJS3002, and d A.CJS3003. The left panel shows the base peak corresponding to the compounds, while the right panel indicates the spectrum. The spectra showed doubly charged ions for wild-type ramoplanin A2 (m/z 1278), deschloro-ramoplanin A2 (2, m/z 1261), monochloro-ramoplanin A2 produced by A.CJS3002 (m/z 1278), and monochloro-ramoplanin A2 produced by A.CJS3003 (m/z 1278) 294 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:289\u2013298 signal was detected. Furthermore, the transcription of the het-erologously introduced end30 was comparative with that of the A.CJS3003 (Fig. 2c). Biological evaluation of the deschloro-ramoplanin A2 The in vitro evaluation of the deschloro-ramoplanin A2 pro-duced from A.CJS3001 against B. subtiliswas conducted. The deschloro-ramoplanin A2 retained activity against B. subtilis, and the inhibition zone showed no measurable difference compared to the intact ramoplanin A2 (Fig. 6). Discussion Halogenation is a common modification on natural products including peptide antibiotics such as ramoplanin and enduracidin. The halogen atoms may contribute to the bioactivity profoundly, and thus, many efforts were laid on manipulating halogenase for creating unnatural-natural prod-ucts with altered halogenation patterns through combinatorial biosynthesis. Ramoplanin shares close similarity in both struc-ture and biosynthetic pathway with enduracidin. However, the chlorinating site and level occurred in these two compounds were different. The factors that determine the halogenating site and level are still unknown. Generally, there may be three time points that halogenation could take place during the biosynthesis of natural products according to the sub-strate selectivity. Halogenation could occur on the building blocks which were utilized in subsequential procedure (Keller et al. 2000; Yeh et al. 2005), and halogenation could take place during the peptide elongation stage (Thomas et al. 2002; Dorrestein et al. 2005). Examples of late-stage halogenation are emerging (Foulston and Bibb 2010; Zeng and Zhan 2010; Wu et al. 2011). In this study, we investigated the halogenation during the biosynthesis of Fig. 4 TOF-MS analysis of ramoplanins from the fermentation broth of a ram20 in-frame deleted mutant A.CJS3001 and b ram29 in-frame deleted mutant A.CJS1001. Doubly charged molecular ions at m/z 1261 (2) and m/z 1132 (4), consistent with the proposed deschloro-ramoplanin A2 and dichloro-ramoplanin A2 aglycone, respectively Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:289\u2013298 295 ramoplanin through genetic manipulation of ramoplanin and enduracidin halogenase in ATCC33076. We first conducted the bio-informatics analysis on the NRPS genes. Structurally, there are six Hpg residues in the peptide backbone and the substrate specificity of the adenylation domains in the biosynthetic gene cluster corre-sponding to each Hpg is identical (DAYHLGLLCK). In an-other word, these adenylation domains would recognize and then incorporate building blocks indiscriminately, but the eventual product only had the monochlorinated Hpg17. Thus, this result illustrates that the free Hpg may be the substrate of the Ram20, but in the biosynthesis of ramoplanin, the Cl-Hpg may not be recognized and incorporated by NRPS, which is in accordance with studies on balhimycin halogenation (Puk et al. 2004). It can be speculated that the halogenation occurs during the peptide elongation or after the peptide backbone was assembled. Then, gene manipulation was conducted to probe the func-tion of ram20, the only apparent halogenase gene. The in-frame deletion of ram20 from ATCC33076 was shown to accumulate deschloro-ramoplanins, and the self-complemented mutant restored the capacity of producing ramoplanin. These results experimentally confirmed that ram20 encodes the only halogenase in the ramoplanin biosyn-thetic pathway which is in agreement with previous reports (McCafferty et al. 2002). Enduracidin (Fig. 1) is a potent antimicrobial agent which shares great similarity in structure with ramoplanin, and end30 is the only halogenase gene responsible for the dichlorination at the Hpg13 (Yin et al. 2010). End-orf30 showed 62 % amino acid identity with Ram20; thus, it may be able to halogenate the macrocycle of ramoplanin. To test this hypothesis, a het-erologously complemented mutant which overexpresses enduracidin halogenase in the Ram20-deficient strain was constructed. Analysis of the metabolite produced by the het-erologously complemented strain revealed a monochlorinated ramoplanin species, and the chlorine atom introduced by enduracidin halogenase was located at the Hpg17. This finding is interesting since End30 is the only halogenase in enduracidin biosynthesis pathway and is responsible for the introduction of two chlorine atoms onto the Hpg13, but when introduced into the ram20-deficient strain, it preferentially Fig. 5 Localization of the chlorine atom onmonochlorinated ramoplanin A2 produced by A.CJS3003 and dichloro-ramoplanin A2 aglycone produced by A.CJS1001 by tandem MS analysis. a The fragment profile with the first fragment at OH-Asn2 and Hpg17. b The fragment profile with the first fragment occurring at D-Orn4 and D-aThr5. c The fragment profile with the first fragment at the Leu15 and D-Ala16 Fig. 6 The zones of inhibition produced by the ramoplanin A2 standards and purified deschloro-ramoplanin A2. 1 Ramoplanin A2, 2 purified deschloro-ramoplanin A2.

Due to the amino acid sequence similarity between Ram20 and End30, this finding indicates that the nonribosomal peptide (NRP) sequence may determine the halogenating site and level. To further investigate the involvement of enduracidin halogenase in the biosynthetic pathway of ramoplanin, end30 was introduced into ATCC33076. However, analysis of the metabolites produced by the mutant revealed no doubly or triply chlorinated species, although the transcription of the introduced enduracidin halogenase was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Fig. 2c). As previously report-ed, End30 was responsible for dichlorination of the Hpg13 residue of enduracidin (Yin et al. 2010), and in our work, it could monochlorinate the Hpg17 residue of ramoplanin when introduced into the halogenase-deficient strains, but when in-troduced into the wild-type ATCC33076, it could not haloge-nate the counterpart in the ramoplanin structure. This regiose-lectivity may be due to the difference in structure and peptide sequence between ramoplanin and enduracidin. Structurally, ramoplanin has an \u03b1-1,2-dimannosyl moiety appended to Hpg11 but absent in enduracidin. The steric bulk of the dimannosyl moiety may pose a hindrance that could avoid the recognition of the halogenase to the substrate. In our pre-vious study, a mannosyltransferase-inactivated strain was con-structed to produce ramoplanin aglycone (Chen et al. 2013). However, in this work, further analysis revealed a dichlorinated specie of ramoplanin aglycone (4, Fig. 4b, m/z 1132) in the fermentation broth with a low yield. Inspection of the MS/MS spectra of this dichlorinated aglycone revealed that b ions (Fig. 5a, b) for fragment D-aThr5-D-aThr8 (m/z 501.5), D-aThr5-D-Orn10 (m/z 762.8), fatty acid (FA)-Asn1-D-Hpg3 (m/z 495.5), and FA-Asn1-D-Orn4 (m/z 644.7) and y ions (Fig. 5a) for Gly14-Cl-Hpg17 (m/z 443.9) and aThr5-Hpg11 (m/ z 911.4) were still present, thus excluding Hpg3, Hpg6, Hpg7, Hpg11, and Hpg17 as chlorination sites. In addition, a new ion atm/z 354 could be observed, corresponding to the addition of a single chlorine atom attached to Hpg13 (y3 Cl-Hpg13-Leu15) (Fig. 5c). This finding could be a support to the hypothesis that the steric effects of the sugar moiety may affect the halo-genation and the mannosylation takes place after the macrocycle is synthesized. Taken together, we are prone to presume that the halogenation in the ramoplanin biosynthesis occurs simultaneously or after the mannosylation, and the as-sembled macrocycle is taken as a substrate. Halogenation of phenolic moieties was also reported to occur in the late stage of biosynthesis of natural products (Wagner et al. 2009). How-ever, even in the absence of the dimannosyl moiety, the yield of the dichloro-ramoplanin A2 was low, which may indicate that the local sequence of the NRP is the main determinant of the halogenating site and it may be very interesting to create a ramoplanin hybrid with the 11\u201317-amino acid and flanking residues substituted with the counterpart of the enduracidin to further evaluate the hypothesis that the halogenating site and level were dictated by halogenase and NRP sequence. Moreover, we demonstrated that the compatibility of related halogenase and the knowledge gained from this study could be valuable in future works in developing bioactive unnatu-rally natural products, including improved ramoplanin and enduracidin derivatives via combinatorial biosynthesis.

        "Abstract Ramoplanin and enduracidin are lipopeptide anti-biotics effective against Gram-positive pathogens, which share close similarity in structure and biosynthetic pathway. Both compounds have chlorine atoms attached to 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Hpg) but with different chlorinating sites and levels. Here, to probe the factor affecting the site and level of halogenation, gene inactivation and heterologous expression were carried out in Actinoplanes sp. ATCC33076 by homologous recombination.Metabolite analysis confirmed that ram20 encodes the only halogenase in ramoplanin bio-synthetic pathway, and enduracidin halogenase End30 could heterologously complement the ram20-deficient mutant. Ad-ditionally, the mannosyltransferase-deficient mutant produces a dichlorinated ramoplanin aglycone with the halogenation site at Hpg13. This study has refined our understanding of how halogenation occurs in ramoplanin biosynthetic pathway, and lays the foundation for further exploitation of ramoplanin and enduracidin halogenase in combinatorial biosynthesis.

        "Introduction",
        "Ramoplanin A2 (1) is a potent antimicrobial agent pro-duced by Actinoplanes sp. ATCC33076 and is active against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. (VRE), methicillin-r e s i s t an t S taphy lococcus aureus (MRSA) , and vancomycin-intermediate resistant Clostridium difficile (Rolston et al. 1996; Finegold et al. 2004; Pelaez et al. 2005). Structurally, ramoplanin is a macrocycle consisting of 17 amino acids and has a single chlorine atom attached to the 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Hpg)17 (Fig. 1) . Ramoplanin acts as an inhibitor of peptidoglycan formation, thus disrupting the biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall and eventually causes cell death (Lo et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2003). Due to the novel antimicrobial mechanism, no clinical resis-tance to ramoplanin was reported since the discovery of ramoplanin. Ramoplanin is now in phase III clinical trials for C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) in gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Paknikar and Narayana 2012). The biosynthetic gene cluster has been isolated and reported, and the assembly of the peptide core as well as the biosynthesis pathway of the non-proteingenic amino acid were elucidated (McCafferty et al. 2002; Hoertz et al. 2012). Among the gene clusters, ram20 was predicted to encode the only halogenase responsi-ble for introducing the single chlorine atom onto the Hpg17.",
        "Enduracidin (5) is a lipodepsipeptide antibiotic closely re-lated to ramoplanin (Fig. 1). It shares similarity in structure and mechanism of action with ramoplanin. Enduracidin con-tains six Hpg residues at the same position as its counterpart and has one chlorinated Hpg. Previous study (Yin et al. 2010)",

        "Halogenation is a frequent modification in the biosynthesis of natural products. To date, over 4000 halogenated natural products have been reported (Gribble 2010). Halogen atoms may profoundly influence the activity of these compounds (Harris et al. 1985; Bister et al. 2003; Eust\u00e1quio et al. 2003). The halogenation strategies in natural product biosynthesis were well reviewed before (Neumann et al. 2008; Butler and Sandy 2009; Wagner et al. 2009). FADH2-dependent halogenase is frequently found in nonribosomal peptide syn-thetase (NRPS)/PKS biosynthetic clusters and is responsible for halogenating bacterially derived secondary metabolites in-cluding ramoplanin and enduracidin. Characterization of the mechanism of chlorination, including timing and substrate specificity, is critical for utilizing halogenase to expand the diversification of these biologically important compounds.",

        "Discussion",
        "Halogenation is a common modification on natural products including peptide antibiotics such as ramoplanin and enduracidin. The halogen atoms may contribute to the bioactivity profoundly, and thus, many efforts were laid on manipulating halogenase for creating unnatural-natural prod-ucts with altered halogenation patterns through combinatorial biosynthesis. Ramoplanin shares close similarity in both struc-ture and biosynthetic pathway with enduracidin. However, the chlorinating site and level occurred in these two compounds were different. The factors that determine the halogenating site and level are still unknown. Generally, there may be three time points that halogenation could take place during the biosynthesis of natural products according to the sub-strate selectivity. Halogenation could occur on the building blocks which were utilized in subsequential procedure (Keller et al. 2000; Yeh et al. 2005), and halogenation could take place during the peptide elongation stage (Thomas et al. 2002; Dorrestein et al. 2005). Examples of late-stage halogenation are emerging (Foulston and Bibb 2010; Zeng and Zhan 2010; Wu et al. 2011). In this study, we investigated the halogenation during the biosynthesis of",

        "ramoplanin through genetic manipulation of ramoplanin and enduracidin halogenase in ATCC33076.",
        "We first conducted the bio-informatics analysis on the NRPS genes. Structurally, there are six Hpg residues in the peptide backbone and the substrate specificity of the adenylation domains in the biosynthetic gene cluster corre-sponding to each Hpg is identical (DAYHLGLLCK). In an-other word, these adenylation domains would recognize and then incorporate building blocks indiscriminately, but the eventual product only had the monochlorinated Hpg17. Thus, this result illustrates that the free Hpg may be the substrate of the Ram20, but in the biosynthesis of ramoplanin, the Cl-Hpg may not be recognized and incorporated by NRPS, which is in accordance with studies on balhimycin halogenation (Puk et al. 2004). It can be speculated that the halogenation occurs during the peptide elongation or after the peptide backbone was assembled.",
        "Then, gene manipulation was conducted to probe the func-tion of ram20, the only apparent halogenase gene. The in-frame deletion of ram20 from ATCC33076 was shown to accumulate deschloro-ramoplanins, and the self-complemented mutant restored the capacity of producing ramoplanin. These results experimentally confirmed that ram20 encodes the only halogenase in the ramoplanin biosyn-thetic pathway which is in agreement with previous reports (McCafferty et al. 2002).",
        "Enduracidin (Fig. 1) is a potent antimicrobial agent which shares great similarity in structure with ramoplanin, and end30 is the only halogenase gene responsible for the dichlorination at the Hpg13 (Yin et al. 2010). End-orf30 showed 62 % amino acid identity with Ram20; thus, it may be able to halogenate the macrocycle of ramoplanin. To test this hypothesis, a het-erologously complemented mutant which overexpresses enduracidin halogenase in the Ram20-deficient strain was constructed. Analysis of the metabolite produced by the het-erologously complemented strain revealed a monochlorinated ramoplanin species, and the chlorine atom introduced by enduracidin halogenase was located at the Hpg17. This finding is interesting since End30 is the only halogenase in enduracidin biosynthesis pathway and is responsible for the introduction of two chlorine atoms onto the Hpg13, but when introduced into the ram20-deficient strain, it preferentially",

        "To further investigate the involvement of enduracidin halogenase in the biosynthetic pathway of ramoplanin, end30 was introduced into ATCC33076. However, analysis of the metabolites produced by the mutant revealed no doubly or triply chlorinated species, although the transcription of the introduced enduracidin halogenase was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Fig. 2c). As previously report-ed, End30 was responsible for dichlorination of the Hpg13 residue of enduracidin (Yin et al. 2010), and in our work, it could monochlorinate the Hpg17 residue of ramoplanin when introduced into the halogenase-deficient strains, but when in-troduced into the wild-type ATCC33076, it could not haloge-nate the counterpart in the ramoplanin structure. This regiose-lectivity may be due to the difference in structure and peptide sequence between ramoplanin and enduracidin. Structurally, ramoplanin has an \u03b1-1,2-dimannosyl moiety appended to Hpg11 but absent in enduracidin. The steric bulk of the dimannosyl moiety may pose a hindrance that could avoid the recognition of the halogenase to the substrate. In our pre-vious study, a mannosyltransferase-inactivated strain was con-structed to produce ramoplanin aglycone (Chen et al. 2013). However, in this work, further analysis revealed a dichlorinated specie of ramoplanin aglycone (4, Fig. 4b, m/z 1132) in the fermentation broth with a low yield. Inspection of the MS/MS spectra of this dichlorinated aglycone revealed that b ions (Fig. 5a, b) for fragment D-aThr5-D-aThr8 (m/z 501.5), D-aThr5-D-Orn10 (m/z 762.8), fatty acid (FA)-Asn1-D-Hpg3 (m/z 495.5), and FA-Asn1-D-Orn4 (m/z 644.7) and y ions (Fig. 5a) for Gly14-Cl-Hpg17 (m/z 443.9) and aThr5-Hpg11 (m/ z 911.4) were still present, thus excluding Hpg3, Hpg6, Hpg7, Hpg11, and Hpg17 as chlorination sites. In addition, a new ion atm/z 354 could be observed, corresponding to the addition of a single chlorine atom attached to Hpg13 (y3 Cl-Hpg13-Leu15) (Fig. 5c). This finding could be a support to the hypothesis that the steric effects of the sugar moiety may affect the halo-genation and the mannosylation takes place after the macrocycle is synthesized. Taken together, we are prone to presume that the halogenation in the ramoplanin biosynthesis occurs simultaneously or after the mannosylation, and the as-sembled macrocycle is taken as a substrate. Halogenation of phenolic moieties was also reported to occur in the late stage of biosynthesis of natural products (Wagner et al. 2009). How-ever, even in the absence of the dimannosyl moiety, the yield of the dichloro-ramoplanin A2 was low, which may indicate that the local sequence of the NRP is the main determinant of the halogenating site and it may be very interesting to create a ramoplanin hybrid with the 11\u201317-amino acid and flanking residues substituted with the counterpart of the enduracidin to further evaluate the hypothesis that the halogenating site and level were dictated by halogenase and NRP sequence. Moreover, we demonstrated that the compatibility of related halogenase and the knowledge gained from this study could be valuable in future works in developing bioactive unnatu-rally natural products, including improved ramoplanin and enduracidin derivatives via combinatorial biosynthesis.",
