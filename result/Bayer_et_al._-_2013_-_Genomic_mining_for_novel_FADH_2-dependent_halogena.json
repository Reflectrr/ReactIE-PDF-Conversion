Sponges are also known for their large arsenal of natural products, many of which are halogenated. In this study, 36 different FADH2-dependent halogenase gene fragments were amplified from various Caribbean and Mediterranean sponges using newly designed degenerate PCR primers. Four unique halogenase-positive fosmid clones, all containing the highly conserved amino acid motif \u201cGxGxxG\u201d, were identified in the microbial metagenome of Aplysina aerophoba. Sequence analysis of one halogenase-bearing fosmid revealed notably two open reading frames with high homologies to efflux and multidrug resistance proteins. Single cell genomic analysis allowed for a taxonomic assignment of the halogenase genes to specific symbiotic lineages. Specifically, the halogenase cluster S1 is predicted to be produced by a deltap-roteobacterial symbiont and halogenase cluster S2 by a por-ibacterial sponge symbiont. An additional halogenase gene is possibly produced by an actinobacterial symbiont of marine sponges. The identification of three novel, phylogenetically, and possibly also functionally distinct halogenase gene clus-ters indicates that the microbial consortia of sponges are a valuable resource for novel enzymes involved in halogenation reactions. Keywords FADH2-dependent halogenases . Metagenomics . Single cell genomics . Sponges . Porifera . Microbial consortia . Microbial symbionts Introduction Sponges (phylum Porifera) are an extraordinarily rich source for bioactive metabolites. Several thousand com-pounds have been isolated from these marine invertebrates which contain antitumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, and generally cytotoxic activities (Scheuermayer et al. 2006; Blunt et al. 2010; Thomas et al. 2010). Many of the sponge-derived compounds, such as fatty acids, pyrroles, indoles, phenol derivatives, tyrosine derivatives, terpenes, diphenyl ethers, and dioxins are halogenated (Gribble 2003). Sponges and also other sessile animals lack physical defenses and therefore probably experience an enormous predator and epibiont pres-sure which, in turn, is thought to have provoked the evolution of structurally highly diverse, effective, and sophisticated chemical defenses. A number of these marine invertebrate-derived compounds are currently being developed as medical and pharmaceutical drugs; however, the supply problem is still themajor obstacle in this field (Kennedy et al. 2007). Kristina Bayer and Matthias Scheuermayer contributed equally to this work.

The diversity of the sponge-associated microbiota is phylogenetically complex yet highly sponge-specific and is probably permanently associated with the host sponge (for reviews, see Hentschel et al. 2006; Taylor et al. 2007; Webster and Taylor 2011). There is increasing evidence that the most important marine natural product classes, complex polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, are truly synthesized by symbiotic bac-teria rather than by the sponge itself (Salomon et al. 2004; Fisch et al. 2009; Piel 2009; Hochmuth et al. 2010). How-ever, since the vast majority of environmental microorgan-isms including those from sponges are still refractory to cultivation, new experimental approaches are needed to provide information about their genomic potential for natu-ral product biosynthesis. One such approach is metagenomics or environmental genomics which was developed to provide access to the DNA pool of complex environmental microbial consortia in a cultivation-independent manner (Handelsman 2004; Grozdanov and Hentschel 2007; Kennedy et al. 2007). So far, polyketide synthase (Piel et al. 2004; Fieseler et al. 2007; Fisch et al. 2009) and non-ribosomal peptide synthe-tase gene clusters (Schirmer et al. 2005), ribosomal operons (Schleper et al. 1998; Fieseler et al. 2006), as well as functional enzymes (Schleper et al. 1997; Kennedy et al. 2011) were recovered from marine sponge-associated microbiota by ways of metagenomics that would have been inaccessible by conventional techniques. The metagenomics approach has recently been comple-mented by single cell genomics (Hutchison and Venter 2006; Walker and Parkhill 2008). Here, microbial cells are sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or any other cell separation technique, and the DNA of individual microbial cells is then amplified using phi29-polymerase, resulting in a billion-fold amplification of the original DNA. Single cell genomics has provided valuable insights into the genomes of single microbial cells such as that of a poribacte-rial sponge symbiont (Siegl et al. 2010). Single cell genomics has also allowed the cloning of secondary metabolite gene clusters from single amplified genomes (Siegl and Hentschel 2010; Grindberg et al. 2011) and to link functional genes to their phylogenetic origin (Stepanauskas and Sieracki 2007; Siegl and Hentschel 2010) which is notoriously difficult in complex metagenomic DNA pools. The knowledge of the phylogenetic origin of any product is also important for prac-tical purposes, such as choosing the right strain for heterolo-gous expression studies. FADH2-dependent halogenases represent the biggest class of specific halogenating enzymes known to date. This class is responsible for the halogenation of a multitude of bacterial secondary metabolites including balhimycin, rebeccamycin, and pyrrolnitrin. Nearly all known FADH2-dependent halogenases are involved in the halogenation of aromatic or heteroaromatic ring systems. Two distinct sub-groups of enzymes exist, one of which uses phenol or pyrrol as substrate and the other tryptophan (Murphy 2006). Homologues of FADH2-dependent halogenases have been found in various bacterial phyla, including the Actinobac-teria (Pelzer et al. 1999), Cyanobacteria (Rouhiainen et al. 2000), Planctomycetes (Gl\u00f6ckner et al. 2003), and the Pro-teobacteria (Murphy 2006). In this study, we have focussed our efforts on the discov-ery of FADH2-dependent halogenase genes from marine sponge-associated microbiota, because sponges contain structurally diverse halogenated (brominated) metabolites, thus representing a clinically important group of bioactive metabolites. Furthermore, owing to their integration in bio-synthetic gene clusters, halogenases serve as anchors in a genomic mining strategy, which has been instrumental for the discovery of novel biosynthetic gene clusters (Hornung et al. 2007; Gao and Huang 2009). This study contributes to a continued effort to characterize the genomic potential of sponge-associated microorganisms for biotechnologically relevant enzymes and natural products. Materials and Methods Sponge Collection The Mediterranean sponges Aplysina aerophoba, Axinella polypoides, and Axinella damicornis were collected by scuba diving offshore Banyuls-sur-Mer, France (42 \u00b029\u2032 N; 03 \u00b008\u2032 E) and Aplysina cavernicolawas collected offshore Elba, Italy (42 \u00b043\u2032 N; 10 \u00b008\u2032 E). The Caribbean sponges Aplysina archeri, Aplysina cauliformis, Aplysina lacunosa, Agelas con-ifera, Agelas clathrodes, Agelas dispar, Ectyoplasia ferox, Xestospongia muta, Pseudoceratina crassa, and Ptilocaulis sp. were collected offshore Little San Salvador Island, Baha-mas (24 \u00b032\u2032 N; 75 \u00b055\u2032 W). Individual specimens were brought to the surface in plastic bags, frozen in liquid nitrogen on board ship, and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further use. For single cell genomic analyses, A. aerophoba sponges were also collected offshore Rovinj, Croatia (45 \u00b005\u2032N, 13 \u00b038\u2032E). For whole genome amplification (WGA) screenings, the sponges were maintained in seawater aquaria for few days prior to preparation for cell sorting. Degenerate Halogenase Primer Design The deduced amino acid sequences of the following FADH2-dependent halogenases were retrieved from the GenBank data-base: ComH (AAK81830) from Streptomyces lavendulae, CmlS (AAK08979) from Streptomyces venezuelae, Asm12 64 Mar Biotechnol (2013) 15:63\u201372 (AAM54090) fromActinosynnema pretiosum subsp. auranticum, StaK (AAM80530) and StaI (AAM80532) from Streptomyces toyocaensis, PltA (Q9X3R1) and PltM (Q9X3Q8) from Pseudo-monas fluorescens, AdpC (CAC01605) fromAnabaena circinalis 90, XAC4089 (NP_644388) from Xanthomonas axonopodis, BhaA (CAA76550) from Amycolatopsis balhimycina and an unnamed protein (AAL06656) from Streptomyces globisporus. The sequences were submitted to Block Maker Server (http:// blocks.fhcrc.org/) (Henikoff et al. 1995) and five conserved amino acid regions (block A\u2013E) were identified. The CODEHOP pro-gram (http://blocks.fhcrc.org/codehop.html) (Rose et al. 1998) wasused to generate partially degenerate oligonucleotides. Table 1 summarizes conserved amino acid regions used for primer design and provides sequences of designed primer HALOforD and HALOrevE. Tryptophan-specific halogenases were excluded from the primer design. PCR screening of Sponge-Associated Microbiota Genomic DNA was isolated from liquid nitrogen frozen sponge tissues that were ground in a mortar and were further processed using the Fast DNA spin for soil Kit (MP Bio-medicals). For amplification of halogenase genes, the pri-mers HALOforD and HALOrevE were used, and PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (95 \u00b0C for 5 min) followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95 \u00b0C for 30 s), primer annealing (63 \u00b0C for 30 s), primer extension (72 \u00b0C for 30 s), and a final extension step of 2 min at 72\u00b0C. One unit of Taq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen) was used with 100 pmol of each primer and 0.2 pmol of each dNTP in a reaction volume of 50 \u03bcl. The amplification products were run on 2 % agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light. Products of the appropriate size were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qia-gen), ligated into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega) and transformed into electrocompetent Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells. For each PCR product, 20 clones were selected at random and RFLP-analyses using the restriction endonu-clease HaeIII were conducted. Plasmid DNA of clones with an individual banding pattern was isolated by the alkaline lysis method and the correct insert sizes were confirmed by EcoRI endonuclease digestion and agarose gel electropho-resis (Sambrook and Russel 2001). Metagenomic Library Screening and Sequencing of the Halogenase-Bearing Fosmid 3 K12 The metagenomic library, \u201cApae02\u201d, harboring an estimated 1.1 Gb of microbial community DNA was previously con-structed from A. aerophoba (Fieseler et al. 2004, 2006). Altogether, 29,108 individual clones are filed in 76 384-well microtiter plates. Fosmid DNA was isolated from each 384-well plate (each plate representing one \u201cpool\u201d) using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Following identifica-tion of a positive pool by PCR using the halogenase primers HALOforD and HALOrevE, clones were transferred to 12-cm Table 1 Degenerate primer design for FADH2-dependent halogenases Halogenase Forward primer Reverse primer ComH (217) AFESGWFWYIPLSD (303) LVGDAACFVDPVFSSGV CmlS (210) TFEDGWVWMIPIKD (292) LCGDAACFTDPIFRRSV XAC4089 (231) CGPGYWFWLIPLSS (315) LTGEAGVFLDPFYSPGS Asm12 (212) SHSDGWIWAIPLSA (291) MVGDAGCFGDPMFSGGV StaK (216) TFDGGWFWYVPLFG (302) LVGDAACSVDPLFSSGV StaI (238) AFDSGWFWYIPLSD (324) LVGDAACFVDPVFSSGV AAL06656 (217) TFEHGWFWYIPLSP (303) LVGDAACFVDPVFSSGV BhaA (215) AFDSGWFWYIPLSD (301) LVGDAACFVDPVFSSGV PltA (232) PMTNTWVWQIPITE (313) LIGDAARFVDPIFSSGV PltM (232) IFEEGWLWVIPFNN (318) LLPQATGFIDPLFSRGL AdpC (297) CGEGYWVWTIPLST (379) CVGEAGTFPDPFYSPGT Consensus CFEGGWFWYIPLSD LVGDAACFVDPFFSRGV Primer sequence 5\u2032-G GAC GGC TGG TTC TGG NHN ATH CC-3\u2032 5\u2032-CAC GCC GCG GGA GWA NAN NGG RTC-3\u2032 Primer name HALOforD HALOrevE Properties of primer 24 mer, degeneracy 144-fold 24 mer, degeneracy 256-fold Degenerate nucleotide code as follows : N0A + C + G + T, H 0 A + C + T, W 0A + T, R 0 A + G.

PCR products were cloned as described above and sequenced. Of the four unique halogenase-bearing fosmids identified, fosmid 3K12 was chosen for full sequencing in order to characterize the ge-nomic context of the halogenase gene. Shotgun cloning and sequencing of 3K12 (AGOWA GmbH, Berlin, Germany) provided an at least six-fold coverage per base pair. Open reading frames (ORFs) were identified with the computer programs Vector NTI (version 8, Invitrogen) and ORF finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html). If multiple pu-tative ORFs were identified in the same sequence region, the one showing highest sequence similarity to known homo-logues as revealed by translated BLAST (blastx) search (Altschul et al. 1997) was selected. Screening of Whole Genome Amplifications Sponge-associated microbial consortia were extracted from A. aerophoba biomass following the differential centrifugation protocol developed by Fieseler et al. (2004, 2006). Cell sorting was performed by FACS with freshly prepared material fol-lowing the protocol of Siegl and Hentschel (2010). WGAs were screened for halogenase genes using the primers HAL-OforD and HALOrevE, and the PCR products were sequenced directly. In order to determine the phylogenetic identity of the halogenase-positive WGAs, eubacterial 16S rRNA gene pri-mers (27f and 1492r; Lane 1991), poribacterial-specific 16S rRNA gene primers (389f and 1130r; Fieseler et al. 2006), archaeal 16S rRNA gene primers (Arch21f and Arch958r; DeLong 1992), and 18S rRNA gene primers (A and B; Medlin et al. 1988) were applied. PCR products were cleaned using the NucleoSpin Extract II Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and cloned into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega). RFLP analysis using enzymes BsuRI (HaeIII) and MspI (Fermentas) of at least 32 randomly picked clones per WGAwere performed. Inserts of clones showing an individual banding pattern were sequenced. Sequencing Sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and the ABI 377XL automated sequenc-er (Applied Biosystems). The sequence data were edited with the Vector NTI program (Invitrogen). 16S rRNA genes were checked for chimeras using the program pintail (Ashelford et al. 2005). The halogenase gene sequences from marine sponge material were deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers ACY25399\u2013ACY25432. The halogenase gene sequences of the metagenomic clones 26C24, 29G1, and 42I22were deposited into GenBank under the accession numb-ers ACY25433\u2013ACY25435. The complete sequence of meta-genome clone 3K12 was deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers ACY25436\u2013ACY25467. Halogenase and 16S rRNA gene sequences from whole genome amplifications were deposited under accession numbers JN093133\u2013 JN093138 and JN002373\u2013JN002382, respectively. Phylogenetic Analyses The alignment of amino acid sequences was performed over 134 positions including gaps using clustalX (Thompson et al. 1997) and checkedmanually using the program align (Hepperle 2002). For phylogenetic analysis of halogenase amino acid sequences, the program MrBayes (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001) was used. The WAG model was applied and a gamma-shaped rate variation with a proportion of invariable sites was estimated. Temperature was set to 0.1. The analysis was run until standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01. After a burn-in phase every 100th sample of 5,380,000 gener-ations was considered for amino acid tree construction. The phylogenetic tree was edited using the program FigTree v1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Results Primer Validation PCR analysis of genomic DNA from potentially FADH2-dependent halogenase-bearing bacteria was performed in order to validate the new primers, HALOforD and HALO-revE (Table 1). Amplification products of the deduced size of around 300 bp were obtained from DNA of Amycolatop-sis orientalis DSM 40040T and from Pseudomonas syringae (potato rhizosphere isolate strain L\u00fcsewitz) and Pseudomo-nas aeruginosa (wt), taken from the ZINF strain collection, University of Wuerzburg. Sequencing of the respective PCR products confirmed the presence of FADH2-dependent hal-ogenase genes in these bacteria. As expected, amplification products were not obtained from several Enterobacteriaceae strains (E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolytica, and Salmonella typhimurium) which are not known to con-tain halogenase genes (data not shown). Halogenase Genes from Sponge-Associated Microbiota Altogether, 36 different putative FADH2-dependent halogen-ase gene fragments of about 300 bp in size were found from the Mediterranean species A. aerophoba (n05) and A. cav-ernicola (n02) as well as from the Caribbean species A. archeri (n05), A. cauliformis (n05), A. lacunosa (n05), A. conifera (n04), A. clathrodes (n01), X. muta (n04), and E. ferox (n05). No amplification products were recovered from A. dispar and P. crassa as well as from the low microbial abundance (LMA) sponges A. polypoides, A. damicornis, and Ptilocaulis sp.. Seawater samples were also negative. 66 Mar Biotechnol (2013) 15:63\u201372 Halogenase-Containing Metagenome Clones PCR screening of a previously established, >29,000 clone member containing metagenomic library (Fieseler et al. 2006) revealed nine FADH2-dependent halogenase-positive fosmid clones of which four showed unique gene sequences. All four halogenases contained the highly conserved amino acid motif \u201cGxGxxG\u201d, which is located close to the N-terminus of the enzymes and which is essential for the binding of the nucleotide cofactor FADH2 (Scrutton et al. 1990; Wynands and van P\u00e9e 2004). The presence of this conserved amino acid motif, together with the second characteristic halogenase motif \u201cWxWxI\u201d within the sponge-derived sequences supports their identity as halogenases (Table 2). To gain insights into the genomic context of the halogen-ase genes, fosmid 3K12 from the metagenomic library of A. aerophoba was completely sequenced (Fig. 1). The fosmid contained an insert of 40.365 bp in size. The G + C content was of 64.2 mol % and the coding density was 90.4 %. Altogether, 31 potential protein encoding genes and one truncated ORF (ORF32) were identified. A phylogenetic marker such as a ribosomal RNA gene or a housekeeping gene was absent on the sequenced insert. Approximately 30 % of the identified genes were affiliated to genes with unknown function. Genes encoding proteins possibly involved in secondary metabolism are the following (Supplementary Table 1): ORF1 encodes a putative alpha/beta-hydrolase, homologs of which are involved in carbazole catabolism and in naph-thalene degradation. ORF2 encodes a putative enzyme which shows homologies to a monooxygenase of Pirellula staleyi (YP_003372867) involved in dibenzothiophene transformation. The deduced halogenase protein of ORF3 showed high similarity to Clohal (AAN65327) from the clorobiocin gene cluster of Streptomyces roseochromogenes subsp. oscitans. An InterPro scan (Apweiler et al. 2001) of the deduced amino acid sequence of ORF27 (ACY25462) revealed the protein domain \u201cIPR012338\u201d which is typically present in penicillin-binding proteins. The putative protein exhibited homologies to beta-lactamases and to ORF2 of the epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster. The ORF27-encoded protein showed also sequence similarity to the esterase (MitL) of the mitomycin C gene cluster of S. lavendulae NRRL 2564. ORF31 and ORF32 showed high similarity to each other (76 % identical bases over 778 bp) (Supplementary Table 1). Both had significant homologies to integral membrane ef-flux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily PF07690 which transports small solutes across chemiosmotic gra-dients. The putative protein encoded by ORF31 exhibited additionally high similarities to an antibiotic efflux protein of the leinamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (AAN85487, 53 %), to a multidrug resistance protein of Streptomyces pristinaespiralis (CAA58879, 54 %), and to a putative resistance protein of the monensin biosynthetic gene cluster (AAO65793, 53 %). The protein encoded by the truncated ORF32 showed high similarity to the virginiamycin resis-tance protein VarS (BAA78678, 60 %) of Streptomyces virginiae, to the multidrug resistance protein from S. pristi-naespiralis (CAA58879, 61 %), and to RifP (AAC01725, 58 %), a putative efflux transport protein of the rifampicin biosynthetic gene cluster. Halogenase-Containing WGAs From >300 screened WGAs derived from A. aerophoba microbiota, 12 were positive for halogenase genes. For six of the halogenase-positive WGAs, a corresponding bacterial 16S rRNA gene was identified (Table 3). All six WGAs tested negative for 18S rRNA genes and for archaeal 16S rRNA genes.

WGA 2.3_2B contained two phylotypes; one of which was most closely related to a deltaproteobacte-rial 16S rRNA gene sequence and the other one to a Chloroflexi 16S rRNA gene previously identified by single cell genomic analysis (Siegl and Hentschel 2010). WGA 7.12._5G contained a single actinobacterial phylotype. WGA 1-3 G contained a single phylotype of poribacterial origin. WGA 19.1._1E contained two phy-lotypes; one of which related to candidate phylumPoribacteria and the other one toChloroflexi. WGA 7.12._5E also contains a mix of two cells affiliated with the Poribacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. Phylogenetic Analysis of Halogenase Genes The overall layout of the phylogenetic tree revealed large-ly a substrate specific clustering which is consistent with previous reports (Fig. 2) (Hornung et al. 2007; Gao and Huang 2009). Cluster A contains exclusively enzymes responsible for the halogenation of tryptophan-or indole-derived residues such as pyrrolnitrin and rebecca-mycin (van P\u00e9e and Patallo 2006). Cluster B is formed by enzymes that halogenate phenol-residues such as ansami-tocin, substance C-1027, and enduracidin. The halogenase CmlS, involved in the biosynthesis of chloramphenicol, is an exception in this clade as it halogenates aliphatics (Piraee et al. 2004). A distinct subcluster, \u201cB1\u201d, is present in clade \u201cB\u201d that is formed by enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of vancomycin-like glycopeptides. These in-clude for example, complestatin, substances A47934 and A40926, balhimycin, chloroeremomycin, and teicoplanin. A third cluster (C) of known halogenases comprises enzymes responsible for the halogenation of pyrrol-rings, with the exception of the halogenase from the neocarzilin gene cluster which halogenates aliphatic substances (Otsuka et al. 2004). The majority of sponge-derived halogenases form one dominant cluster (S1) with two subgroups that is phyloge-netically distinct from all previously known halogenases (Fig. 2). This cluster contains 25 halogenase gene fragments from six different sponge species, all of which belong to the \u201chigh microbial abundance\u201d group of sponges (Hentschel et al. 2003). The cluster furthermore contains three metage-nomic halogenase gene sequences, of which one full meta-genomic clone sequence is presented in this study (Supplementary Table 1). Two halogenase-positive WGAs (WGA 1-4E and WGA 2.3._2B) are also affiliated with the S1 cluster. A second cluster (S2) of halogenase genes con-tains five halogenase gene fragments from different sponges. Moreover, three halogenase genes from WGA screenings (WGA 1-3 G, WGA 7.12._5E, and WGA 19.1._1E) fall into this clade. A third, sponge-derived clus-ter of halogenases (S3) contains one metagenome clone (26 C24) and three PCR fragments from Aplysina and Agelas sponges. One WGA reaction (WGA 7.12._5G) yielded both, a halogenase gene and a 16S rRNA gene, both of which were most closely affiliated with members of the phylum Actinobacteria. Finally, two clustered halogenase gene sequences from A. aerophoba and A. cavernicola and one independent sequence from A. lacunosa are present in Table 3 Phylogenetic affiliation of halogenase-positive WGAs WGAs 16S rRNA Gene -Acc # Top Blast hits, Acc#, (length of overlap/identity in %) host sponge Phylum WGA 1-4E JN002375 Uncultured bacterium clone PK025, EF076115 (97/97) Plakortis sp.

Discussion The primer set developed in this study represents a suitable tool for the detection of FADH2-halogenase genes in envi-ronmental samples as well as in cultivated bacteria. It builds upon a previous publication, where primers were designed to amplify and clone a FADH2-dependent halogenase gene fragment from Streptomyces venezuelae (Piraee and Vining 2002). Eleven different halogenase amino acid sequences were included in the primer design in the present study. Using the primers HALOforD and HALOrevE, FADH2-halogenases could also be amplified from A. orientalis DSM 40040T as well as from P. syringae and P. aeruginosa. We report here on the discovery of at least three phylo-genetically and possibly also functionally distinct clades of novel FADH2-type halogenases in the microbial metage-nomes of marine sponges (Fig. 2). The halogenase genes were identified in five Aplysina and in two Agelas species as well as in X. muta and E. ferox, all of which belong to the \u201chigh microbial abundance\u201d sponge category (Hentschel et al. 2003). FADH2-type halogenase genes were not identified in the LMA sponge species A. polypoides, A. damicornis, and Ptilocaulis sp., suggesting that the microbial producers are members of the sponge-specific symbiotic microbial consortium (Taylor et al. 2007). The genomic context surrounding the putative halogenase on metagenomic fosmid 3 K12 revealed several ORFs that might be involved in secondary metabolism (Supplementary Table 1). Of particular interest are two putative efflux proteins (ORFs 31 and 32) that might be involved in drug resistance. However, since FADH2-dependent halogenases are known to be integrated within secondary metabolite gene clusters, at least from what has been reported in actinomycetes (Hornung et al. 2007; Gao and Huang 2009), cyanobacteria (Cadel-Six et al. 2008), gram-negative bacteria (Costa et al. 2009), and also in Rhodopirellula baltica (Gl\u00f6ckner et al. 2003), the lack of integration of the described halogenase in a typical second-ary metabolite gene cluster is somewhat surprising. It may be postulated that the halogenases from the microbial metage-nomes of sponges are located in trans to the biosynthetic operons whose products they halogenate. In order to obtain information on the original producers of the different halogenase clusters, a single cell genomics-based approach was undertaken. More than 300 WGAs were screened by PCR and six WGAs were shown to contain both halogenase and 16S rRNA genes (Table 3). The presented data allow for the following predictions: halo-genase cluster S1 may be produced by a deltaproteobacterial symbiont, and the halogenase cluster S2 may be produced by a poribacterial symbiont of sponges. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that the halogenase gene obtained from WGA 7.12._5G is produced by an actinobacterial sponge symbiont. The halogenase-positive WGAs, which contained only one phylotype each, are particularly informative in this analysis. It will however only become possible to validate these predictions once more sponge symbiont genomes be-come available. Taken together, genomic mining such as undertaken here by the combination of metagenomics and single cell genomics is a meaningful strategy to explore com-plex microbial consortia for biodiscovery.

        "Abstract Many marine sponges (Porifera) are known to con-tain large amounts of phylogenetically diverse microorganisms. Sponges are also known for their large arsenal of natural products, many of which are halogenated. In this study, 36 different FADH2-dependent halogenase gene fragments were amplified from various Caribbean and Mediterranean sponges using newly designed degenerate PCR primers. Four unique halogenase-positive fosmid clones, all containing the highly conserved amino acid motif \u201cGxGxxG\u201d, were identified in the microbial metagenome of Aplysina aerophoba. Sequence analysis of one halogenase-bearing fosmid revealed notably two open reading frames with high homologies to efflux and multidrug resistance proteins. Single cell genomic analysis allowed for a taxonomic assignment of the halogenase genes to specific symbiotic lineages. Specifically, the halogenase cluster S1 is predicted to be produced by a deltap-roteobacterial symbiont and halogenase cluster S2 by a por-ibacterial sponge symbiont. An additional halogenase gene is possibly produced by an actinobacterial symbiont of marine sponges. The identification of three novel, phylogenetically, and possibly also functionally distinct halogenase gene clus-ters indicates that the microbial consortia of sponges are a valuable resource for novel enzymes involved in halogenation reactions.",

        "Introduction",
        "Sponges (phylum Porifera) are an extraordinarily rich source for bioactive metabolites. Several thousand com-pounds have been isolated from these marine invertebrates which contain antitumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, and generally cytotoxic activities (Scheuermayer et al. 2006; Blunt et al. 2010; Thomas et al. 2010). Many of the sponge-derived compounds, such as fatty acids, pyrroles, indoles, phenol derivatives, tyrosine derivatives, terpenes, diphenyl ethers, and dioxins are halogenated (Gribble 2003). Sponges and also other sessile animals lack physical defenses and therefore probably experience an enormous predator and epibiont pres-sure which, in turn, is thought to have provoked the evolution of structurally highly diverse, effective, and sophisticated chemical defenses. A number of these marine invertebrate-derived compounds are currently being developed as medical and pharmaceutical drugs; however, the supply problem is still themajor obstacle in this field (Kennedy et al. 2007).",

        "Sponges are also known to contain massive amounts of microorganisms within the mesohyl matrix which may con-stitute up to half of the sponge biomass. The diversity of the sponge-associated microbiota is phylogenetically complex yet highly sponge-specific and is probably permanently associated with the host sponge (for reviews, see Hentschel et al. 2006; Taylor et al. 2007; Webster and Taylor 2011). There is increasing evidence that the most important marine natural product classes, complex polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, are truly synthesized by symbiotic bac-teria rather than by the sponge itself (Salomon et al. 2004; Fisch et al. 2009; Piel 2009; Hochmuth et al. 2010). How-ever, since the vast majority of environmental microorgan-isms including those from sponges are still refractory to cultivation, new experimental approaches are needed to provide information about their genomic potential for natu-ral product biosynthesis.",
        "One such approach is metagenomics or environmental genomics which was developed to provide access to the DNA pool of complex environmental microbial consortia in a cultivation-independent manner (Handelsman 2004; Grozdanov and Hentschel 2007; Kennedy et al. 2007). So far, polyketide synthase (Piel et al. 2004; Fieseler et al. 2007; Fisch et al. 2009) and non-ribosomal peptide synthe-tase gene clusters (Schirmer et al. 2005), ribosomal operons (Schleper et al. 1998; Fieseler et al. 2006), as well as functional enzymes (Schleper et al. 1997; Kennedy et al. 2011) were recovered from marine sponge-associated microbiota by ways of metagenomics that would have been inaccessible by conventional techniques.",
        "The metagenomics approach has recently been comple-mented by single cell genomics (Hutchison and Venter 2006; Walker and Parkhill 2008). Here, microbial cells are sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or any other cell separation technique, and the DNA of individual microbial cells is then amplified using phi29-polymerase, resulting in a billion-fold amplification of the original DNA. Single cell genomics has provided valuable insights into the genomes of single microbial cells such as that of a poribacte-rial sponge symbiont (Siegl et al. 2010). Single cell genomics has also allowed the cloning of secondary metabolite gene clusters from single amplified genomes (Siegl and Hentschel 2010; Grindberg et al. 2011) and to link functional genes to their phylogenetic origin (Stepanauskas and Sieracki 2007; Siegl and Hentschel 2010) which is notoriously difficult in complex metagenomic DNA pools. The knowledge of the phylogenetic origin of any product is also important for prac-tical purposes, such as choosing the right strain for heterolo-gous expression studies.",
        "FADH2-dependent halogenases represent the biggest class of specific halogenating enzymes known to date. This class is responsible for the halogenation of a multitude of bacterial secondary metabolites including balhimycin, rebeccamycin, and pyrrolnitrin. Nearly all known FADH2-dependent halogenases are involved in the halogenation of aromatic or heteroaromatic ring systems. Two distinct sub-groups of enzymes exist, one of which uses phenol or pyrrol as substrate and the other tryptophan (Murphy 2006). Homologues of FADH2-dependent halogenases have been found in various bacterial phyla, including the Actinobac-teria (Pelzer et al. 1999), Cyanobacteria (Rouhiainen et al. 2000), Planctomycetes (Gl\u00f6ckner et al. 2003), and the Pro-teobacteria (Murphy 2006).",
        "In this study, we have focussed our efforts on the discov-ery of FADH2-dependent halogenase genes from marine sponge-associated microbiota, because sponges contain structurally diverse halogenated (brominated) metabolites, thus representing a clinically important group of bioactive metabolites. Furthermore, owing to their integration in bio-synthetic gene clusters, halogenases serve as anchors in a genomic mining strategy, which has been instrumental for the discovery of novel biosynthetic gene clusters (Hornung et al. 2007; Gao and Huang 2009). This study contributes to a continued effort to characterize the genomic potential of sponge-associated microorganisms for biotechnologically relevant enzymes and natural products.",

For amplification of halogenase genes, the pri-mers HALOforD and HALOrevE were used, and PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (95 \u00b0C for 5 min) followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95 \u00b0C for 30 s), primer annealing (63 \u00b0C for 30 s), primer extension (72 \u00b0C for 30 s), and a final extension step of 2 min at 72\u00b0C. One unit of Taq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen) was used with 100 pmol of each primer and 0.2 pmol of each dNTP in a reaction volume of 50 \u03bcl. The amplification products were run on 2 % agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light. Products of the appropriate size were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qia-gen), ligated into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega) and transformed into electrocompetent Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells. For each PCR product, 20 clones were selected at random and RFLP-analyses using the restriction endonu-clease HaeIII were conducted.

        "Discussion",
        "The primer set developed in this study represents a suitable tool for the detection of FADH2-halogenase genes in envi-ronmental samples as well as in cultivated bacteria. It builds upon a previous publication, where primers were designed to amplify and clone a FADH2-dependent halogenase gene fragment from Streptomyces venezuelae (Piraee and Vining 2002). Eleven different halogenase amino acid sequences were included in the primer design in the present study. Using the primers HALOforD and HALOrevE, FADH2-halogenases could also be amplified from A. orientalis DSM 40040T as well as from P. syringae and P. aeruginosa.",
        "We report here on the discovery of at least three phylo-genetically and possibly also functionally distinct clades of novel FADH2-type halogenases in the microbial metage-nomes of marine sponges (Fig. 2). The halogenase genes were identified in five Aplysina and in two Agelas species as well as in X. muta and E. ferox, all of which belong to the \u201chigh microbial abundance\u201d sponge category (Hentschel et al. 2003). FADH2-type halogenase genes were not identified in the LMA sponge species A. polypoides, A. damicornis, and Ptilocaulis sp., suggesting that the microbial producers are members of the sponge-specific symbiotic microbial consortium (Taylor et al. 2007).",
        "The genomic context surrounding the putative halogenase on metagenomic fosmid 3 K12 revealed several ORFs that might be involved in secondary metabolism (Supplementary Table 1). Of particular interest are two putative efflux proteins (ORFs 31 and 32) that might be involved in drug resistance. However, since FADH2-dependent halogenases are known to be integrated within secondary metabolite gene clusters, at least from what has been reported in actinomycetes (Hornung et al. 2007; Gao and Huang 2009), cyanobacteria (Cadel-Six et al. 2008), gram-negative bacteria (Costa et al. 2009), and also in Rhodopirellula baltica (Gl\u00f6ckner et al. 2003), the lack of integration of the described halogenase in a typical second-ary metabolite gene cluster is somewhat surprising. It may be postulated that the halogenases from the microbial metage-nomes of sponges are located in trans to the biosynthetic operons whose products they halogenate.",
        "In order to obtain information on the original producers of the different halogenase clusters, a single cell genomics-based approach was undertaken. More than 300 WGAs were screened by PCR and six WGAs were shown to contain both halogenase and 16S rRNA genes (Table 3). The presented data allow for the following predictions: halo-genase cluster S1 may be produced by a deltaproteobacterial symbiont, and the halogenase cluster S2 may be produced by a poribacterial symbiont of sponges. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that the halogenase gene obtained from WGA 7.12._5G is produced by an actinobacterial sponge symbiont. The halogenase-positive WGAs, which contained only one phylotype each, are particularly informative in this analysis. It will however only become possible to validate these predictions once more sponge symbiont genomes be-come available. Taken together, genomic mining such as undertaken here by the combination of metagenomics and single cell genomics is a meaningful strategy to explore com-plex microbial consortia for biodiscovery.",
