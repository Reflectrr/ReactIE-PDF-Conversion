However, first attempts to improve halogenase stability by error-prone PCR have resulted in mutants with higher temperature stability. To facilitate the screening for mutants with higher activity, a high-throughput assay was developed. Formation of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) of halogenases has increased halogenase lifetime by a factor of about 10, and CLEAs have been used to produce halo-genated tryptophan in gram scale. Analyses of the substrate specificity of tryptophan halogenases have shown that they accept a much broader range of substrates than previously thought. The introduction of tryptophan halogenase genes into bacteria and plants led to the in vivo formation of peptides containing halogenated tryptophan Methods in Enzymology, Volume 575 # 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The halogen atoms in these com-pounds could be chemically exchanged against other substituents by cross-coupling reactions leading to novel compounds. Site-directed mutageneses have been used to modify the substrate specificity and the regioselectivity of flavin-dependent trypto-phan halogenases. Since many flavin-dependent halogenases only accept protein-bound substrates, enzymatic and chemoenzymatic syntheses for protein-tethered substrates were developed, and the synthesized substrates were used in enzymatic halogenation reactions. 1. INTRODUCTION Flavin-dependent halogenases are a promising group of halogenating enzymes. They catalyze halogenation reactions with high regioselectivity and without the formation of by-products except water and thus provide the opportunity for industrial-scale production of chlorinated pharmaceuticals and organic compounds. However, the low stability of halogenases under reaction conditions, leading to fast inactivation, hampers their application in industry. Thus, it is of great importance to increase their stability under reaction conditions. While their high substrate specificity is of advantage in their natural environment, it is a disadvantage for their extensive application and therefore needs to be broadened. Furthermore, all so far known flavin-dependent halogenases have a rather low reactivity with kcat-values around 1\u20137 minNone1 which also needs considerable improvement. Flavin-dependent halogenases are a two-component system consisting of a flavin reductase providing the actual halogenase with FADH2 produced from NADH and FAD. For industrial application of the two-component system, effective regeneration of the reducing agents is also required. The best-investigated flavin-dependent halogenases are the tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA from pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis (Keller et al., 2000) and RebH from rebeccamycin biosynthesis (Sanchez et al., 2002), the tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH frompyrroindomycin B biosynthesis (Zehner et al., 2005), and the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal/ThdH from thienodolin biosynthesis (Milbredt, Patallo, & van Pe\u0301e, 2014; Seibold et al., 2006) which all accept L-and D-tryptophan as their natural substrates. Additionally, work on halogenases catalyzing the halo-genation of peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-bound pyrrole carboxylic acid or PCP-tethered peptides showed how complex natural substrates of halogenases can be produced by enzymatic or chemical synthesis. The last 10 years have seen considerable progress toward the understanding and improvement of the properties of halogenases which will be described later. 66 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. 2. INACTIVATION OF HALOGENASES UNDER REACTION CONDITIONS 2.1 Improvement of Halogenase Stability by Error-Prone PCR Flavin-dependent halogenases were found to completely lose their activity already 2\u20133 h after the start of the reaction (Fig. 1). One possible reason for this instability could be a simple temperature sensitivity, but there is also the possibility of an altered protein structure due to reaction with the halogenat-ing intermediate or other side products formed at the active site. The halo-genating agent produced by the enzymes is hypohalous acid which is directed to the substrate through a 10-A\u030a long tunnel (Dong et al., 2005). This hypohalous acid might not only react with the substrate but also with amino acids located along the tunnel. For example, the reaction of amino acids with hypochlorous acid can lead to formation of chloramines, 3-chlorotyrosines or 3-hydroxytryptophans (Stadtman & Levine, 2006). On the other hand, the reaction of FADH2 with oxygen can lead to the for-mation of hydrogen peroxide or even superoxide anion radical. These could in turn react with the halogenase and damage the protein structure and Fig. 1 Time course of conversion of tryptophan to 5-chlorotryptophan, 6-chlorotryptophan, and 7-chlorotryptophan by PyrH, Thal/ThdH, and PrnA, respec-tively. The amount of tryptophan at the start of the reaction was 400 nmol for PyrH and Thal/ThdH and 50 nmol for PrnA. The reason for the observed decrease in formed product by PyrH and Thal/ThdH after 2.5\u20133 h is not known. 67Flavin-Dependent Halogenases thereby result in its loss of activity. Product inhibition was also considered as a possible reason for the loss of activity during incubation under reaction conditions. Up to now, there are no studies dealing with the mechanisms of inactivation of flavin-dependent halogenases. Nevertheless, the last few years have seen investigations dealing with ways to increase the stability of flavin-dependent halogenases. Muffler, Kuetchou Ngnigha, and Ulber (2010) characterized the acti-vity of the tryptophan-5-halogenase PyrH from Streptomyces rugosporus LL-42D005 which is involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic pyrroindomycin B (Zehner et al., 2005). Checking the deactivation con-stants of PyrH, they recognized the instability of PyrH at 30\u00b0C. After 3 h at this temperature, the enzyme showed nearly no activity, anymore. PyrH was longer active at lower temperatures (after 6 h of incubation, 70% activity at 18\u00b0C and 90% activity at 0\u00b0C were left). For this reason, they recommended a lower temperature for the enzyme activity assay than the normally used 30\u00b0C. However, this results in a decrease of the activity of the halogenases, since most of them have their temperature opti-mum around 30\u00b0C, eg, PrnA at 30\u00b0C (Flecks et al., 2008) and Thal/ThdH at 32\u00b0C (Ernyei, 2008). The addition of compounds known to stabilize enzymes such as glycerol, glucose, or sucrose had no stabilizing effect under reaction conditions (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Time course of conversion of tryptophan to 6-chlorotryptophan by Thal/ThdH in comparison with reactions containing glycerol (2.2%), glucose (250 mg/mL), and sucrose (250 mg/mL), respectively. The amount of tryptophan at the start of reactionwas 60 nmol. 68 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. Investigations into the linearity of the reaction of the three tryptophan halogenases PrnA, PyrH, and Thal/ThdH showed that the reaction veloc-ities of these enzymes are only linear for a short period of time of about 30 min and then start to decline. This is of high importance for the deter-mination of kinetic data (Fig. 1). Therefore, kinetic data should always be taken in the first minutes of the reaction to be sure to stay in the linear region. However, since activity measurements have to be done by HPLC analysis, rather high amounts of the enzymes are required to make sure that the product peaks are high enough for quantification. The first problem to solve when working with flavin-dependent halogenases is the issue of overexpression of the halogenase gene. Until now, nobody has achieved to show halogenating activity in a wild-type strain producing a halogenase. Only after high overexpression of the halogenase gene and production of soluble halogenase, halogenating activity can be detected. Overexpression of halogenase genes in soluble form in E. coli seems to be quite problematic and forced the group of Jared Lewis to construct a maltose-binding protein halogenase fusion protein to obtain enough of the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH and the flavin reductase RebF from rebeccamycin biosynthesis in Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes for their work (Payne, Andorfer, & Lewis, 2013; Sanchez et al., 2002). In our hands, expression of halogenase genes from different sources in Pseudomonas strains works excellent with extremely high overexpression (Keller et al., 2000; Seibold et al., 2006; Zehner et al., 2005), although sometimes the clones completely lose their ability to express the genes. In these cases, fresh trans-formation of Pseudomonas with the plasmids isolated from E. coli, not from Pseudomonas, will solve the problem. During their further work with RebH, Poor, Andorfer, and Lewis (2014) also encountered the problem of instability. During the enzyme reaction in a preparative scale, an extensive precipitation of RebH occur-red. In their opinion, an increase of thermostability could lead to a longer lifetime of RebH, an increase of stress tolerance and might also enable higher reaction temperatures. Due to the lack of a high-throughput assay, every single E. coli clone obtained by error-prone PCR had to be grown separately, lysed, and was then incubated at elevated tempera-tures, followed by incubation under reaction conditions for 16 and up to 48 h, and analyzed for overall product formation by HPLC. The mutations of variants showing higher product formation after this treat-ment were combined using overlap extension PCR. This procedure was repeated twice, and the most promising variants of RebH were characterized in detail. 69Flavin-Dependent Halogenases The two RebH variants 3-LR and 3-LSR showed the best conversion and were further characterized. The mutant RebH variant 3-LR showed a 5\u00b0C higher optimal temperature and 100% more product than wild-type RebH at its optimal temperature. Additionally, the yield of product for the conversion of several other substrates was higher, compared to the wild-type enzyme. An examination of the reaction profiles showed an about threefold longer lifetime of 3-LSR than the wild-type enzyme. Fur-thermore, steady-state kinetic data were collected at 21\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C for wild-type RebH and the mutant 3-LSR. Both enzymes show a similar kcat/Km at 40\u00b0C, whereas the wild type has a significantly higher kcat/Km at 21\u00b0C. This is due to a significantly lower catalytic efficiency of the 3-LSR mutant at 21\u00b0C (Table 1; Poor et al., 2014). Thus, the higher pro-duct yield of the RebH variant is due to a longer lifetime, compensating a lower catalytic activity. This shows that directed evolution is one way to create better halogenases but seems not to be the most efficient. 2.2 Stabilization of Halogenases by Formation of Cross-Linked Enzyme Aggregates (CLEAs) Characterization of kinetic parameters such as Km, kcat and total turnover numbers of different tryptophan halogenases showed that in vitro enzyma-tic halogenation is an inefficient reaction (Table 2) which is in a large part due to the instability of the halogenases (Dong et al., 2005; Frese, Guzowska, Vo\u00df, & Sewald, 2014; Seibold et al., 2006; Yeh, Garneau, & Walsh, 2005; Zehner et al., 2005). Thus, the biotechnological application of these enzymes is still restricted. Enzyme immobilization has been proven as an efficient method to deal with enzyme stability problems. In contrast to soluble enzymes, immobilized enzymes are more stable, easy to handle, and facilitate efficient recovery and reuse. Cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) are biocatalysts prepared via physical enzyme aggregation followed Table 1 Kinetic Data for the Halogenation of 2-Methyltryptamine by the Wild-Type Tryptophan 7-Halogenase RebH and Its 3-LSR Variant at Different Temperatures (Poor et al., 2014) Enzyme T (\u00b0C) Km (\u03bcM) kcat (s21) kcat/Km (s21 \u03bcM21) RebH wild type 21 16.8None3.8 0.060None0.0057 3.6None10None3 3-LSR variant 21 40.2None3.7 0.013None0.00036 3.3None10None4 RebH wild type 40 280.1None18.4 0.25None0.0095 8.8None10None4 3-LSR variant 40 202.5None12.7 0.15None0.0093 7.9None10None4 70 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. by treatment with a cross-linking agent, most commonly glutaraldehyde (Sheldon, 2011) to covalently link the proteins. Preparation of CLEAs includes two simple steps: precipitation of native enzymes with ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol and a cross-linking reaction of free amino groups of lysine residues with neighboring enzyme molecules by addition of glutaraldehyde. Recently, Frese and Sewald (2014) described the formation of CLEAs for halogenases. These CLEAs contained the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH from L. aerocolonigenes and enzymes required for cofactor regenera-tion, a flavin reductase from Pseudomonas fluorescens BL915 (PrnF; K.-H. van Pe\u0301e, unpublished) and an alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus sp. (ADH; Fig. 3). Using these CLEAs, halogenation of the natural substrate L-tryptophan as well as D-tryptophan and L-5-hydroxytryptophan was achieved in a gram scale, showing that the long-term stability and the preparative application of tryptophan halogenases can be achieved. 2.2.1 Preparation of CLEAs 1.

Incubate at 37\u00b0C and 150 rpm shaking until OD600 reaches 0.4\u20130.6. 2. Induce the expression of the halogenase gene by addition of 100 \u03bcM IPTG and 2 mg/mL arabinose and incubate for further 20 h at 25\u00b0C. 3. Harvest cells by centrifugation (4000None g, 30 min, 4\u00b0C). 4. Resuspend cells in 25 mL of 100 mMNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, lyse cells twice by French Press, and centrifuge (10,000None g, 30 min, 4\u00b0C). 5. Add 2.5 U/mL flavin reductase PrnF and 1 U/mL alcohol dehydro-genase to the cleared lysate and mix thoroughly. 6. Add 16.2 g of ammonium sulfate (None95% saturation) at 4\u00b0C in a tube rotator for 1 h. 7. Add glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) and incubate for additional 2 h at 4\u00b0C in a tube rotator. 8. Centrifuge the resulting CLEAs (10,000None g, 30 min, 4\u00b0C) and wash three times with 50 mL of 100 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4. 9. Resuspend the solid biocatalyst in 50 mL of 100 mMNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, and store overnight at 4\u00b0C prior to use. 2.2.2 Halogenation Using CLEAs CLEAs obtained by the procedure described earlier can be used for batch-wise halogenation of tryptophan (Frese & Sewald, 2014). For this purpose, 30 mL of 15 mMNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, containing 3 mM tryptophan, 100 \u03bcM NAD, 10 \u03bcM FAD, 5% (v/v) isopropanol, and 30 mM NaCl or NaBr (for chlorination or bromination, respectively) are used to resuspend CLEAs in a 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated under slow stirring at 25\u00b0C. After 24 h, the reaction solution is centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000None g, and the supernatant is analyzed by RP-HPLC. CLEAs can be reused after a washing step with 20 mL of 10 mM Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.4. It has been demonstrated that CLEAs containing RebH can be recycled at least 10 times with no significant loss of activity. In our hands, the life time of PyrH under reaction conditions was improved up to about 20 h compared to about 2 h for the free enzyme (Fig. 4). However, after about 20 h, the enzyme became inactive. Obvi-ously, the halogenase inside the CLEAs was stabilized by a yet unknown mechanism. 2.2.3 Gram-Scale Halogenation Reaction Using CLEAs A serious disadvantage of halogenation reactions using tryptophan halogenases is their low overall turnover number that strongly reduces their 72 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. industrial application. The CLEA methodology is suitable to overcome stability and enzyme recovery problems. Payne et al. (2013) used 10 L E. coli culture overexpressing rebH to obtain around 100 mg chlorinated pro-duct. Frese and Sewald (2014) achieved gram-scale reaction using CLEAs containing the overproduced halogenase RebH from 6 L E. coli culture. The reaction mixture consisted of 15 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM tryp-tophan, 100 \u03bcMNAD, 1 \u03bcM FAD, 5% (v/v) isopropanol, and 30 mMNaBr in a final volume of 5 L at 25\u00b0C and 150 rpm. After 8 days, complete con-version of L-tryptophan was observed, yielding 1.8 g of L-Br-tryptophan. The conversion of tryptophan to 5-chlorotryptophan by CLEAs of the tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH and the flavin reductase PrnF is shown in Fig. 4. 3. THE BIOCATALYTIC SCOPE OF FLAVIN-DEPENDENT TRYPTOPHAN HALOGENASES 3.1 Substrate Specificity of Tryptophan Halogenases The first findings about the substrate specificity of flavin-dependent trypto-phan halogenases were published in 2001 for the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA from P. fluorescens BL915 (Ho\u0308lzer, Burd, Rei\u00dfig, & van Pe\u0301e, 2001). It was shown that this enzyme is able to chlorinate a number of tryptophan, indole, and phenylpyrrole derivatives, but only with its natural substrate tryptophan regioselective chlorination in the position 7 of the indole ring Fig. 4 Plot of the conversion of tryptophan to 5-chlorotryptophan by CLEAs containing the tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH and the flavin reductase PrnF against time. 73Flavin-Dependent Halogenases was achieved. With all the compounds different from tryptophan, haloge-nation proceeded with a relaxed regioselectivity and chlorination mostly occurred at the electronically most activated 2-position of the indole ring. In some cases, even a mixture of different chlorinated products or dichlorination was observed. These findings led to the conclusion that only the natural substrate tryptophan can be bound correctly in the active site of the enzyme PrnA to allow regioselective chlorination and that this might also be the case for other flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases from other secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways. During the following years, a multitude of new halogenase genes, among them the genes of several flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases, was isolated from secondary metabolite gene clusters. In a few cases, the genes were heterologously expressed, the enzymes characterized in regard to their natural substrates and the kinetic parameters of the reaction were determined (Weichold, Milbredt, & van Pe\u0301e, 2016). In some cases also the 3D structures of the enzymes were solved (Bitto et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2005; Yeh, Blasiak, Koglin, Drennan, & Walsh, 2007; Zhu et al., 2009). No further investiga-tions were published on the substrate specificity of tryptophan halogenases until more than one decade later. The next data on this issue were published by Payne et al. (2013) who described the chlorination and also the bromi-nation of indole, several tryptophan derivatives and also less structurally related compounds like tryptoline and the two differently monosubstituted naphthalenes, 2-aminonaphthalene and 1-hydroxynaphthalene. In 2014, Frese et al. (2014) described the conversion of several fluoro-, methyl-, amino-, and hydroxy-substituted tryptophan derivatives by RebH. Exten-ding the biocatalytic scope of tryptophan halogenases even further, Shepherd et al. (2015) showed that the tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH and the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA are not only able to convert tryptophan derivatives to their respective halogenated analogs but also accept nonindolic substrates such as the aniline derivatives kynurenine and anthranilamide. All the mentioned groups working on the issue of the conversion of compounds others than tryptophan by tryptophan halogenases described different experiments to obtain new halogenated compounds. The protocols differ in expression hosts and fusion tags for pro-tein purification. The reaction conditions during the large scale conversions as well as the methods used for quenching of the reactions and product puri-fication are different which makes it quite difficult to compare the existing protocols. A short overview summarizing the reaction conditions applied for the large-scale conversion of different compounds is given in Table 3. 74 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al.

Unfortu-nately, the construction of such improved halogenases is severely hampered by the issue of mutant screening. Every single clone of a mutant library needs to be grown, followed by cell lysis and incubation of the cell-free extracts with potential substrates and finally the enzyme assays need to be analyzed for possible conversion products by HPLC or other methods. This makes the screening of mutant libraries for halogenases accepting new sub-strates a really tough challenge. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to develop high-throughput techniques using simple detection methods. A publication by Hoshford, Shepherd, Micklefield, and Wong (2014) describes such a high-throughput assay for arylamine halogenation in aqueous solutions. This colorimetric assay is based on a peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed in situ oxidation of 4-methyl-catechol and the following addition of chlorinated or nonhalogenated arylamines (benzoquinone\u2013 amine-coupling reaction) which can be analyzed spectrophotometrically due to a shift of the absorbance maxima of the halogenated compounds in comparison to their nonhalogenated analogs (Fig. 5). Unfortunately, this reaction requires the presence of an arylamine functionality in the molecule which makes this assay suitable for only a limited number of potential halogenase substrates.

Introducing genes coding for tryptophan halogenases with different 78 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. regioselectivities into bacteria or plants producing halogenated secondary metabolites resulted in the production of variants of those halogenated com-pounds.

(2006) introduced the tryptophan 6-halogenases gene (thal/thdH) from the biosynthesis of thienodolin in Streptomyces albogriseolus (Milbredt et al., 2014) into the pyrrolnitrin producer Pseudomonas chlororaphis ACN. Although this strain still contained the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene prnA, overexpression of the tryptophan 6-halogenase gene thal/thdH was so high that all available tryptophan was converted to 6-chlorotryptophan thus no 7-chlorotryptophan was available for pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis. How-ever, 6-chlorotryptophan formed by the reaction of Thal/ThdH was accepted as a substrate by the second enzyme in the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic pathway, PrnB, resulting in the formation of the phenylpyrrole derivative 3-(20-amino-40-chlorophenyl)pyrrole. But the next enzyme, the mon-odechloroaminopyrrolnitrin 3-halogenase (PrnC; Hohaus et al., 1997; Kirner et al., 1998) did not accept this compound as a substrate which was thus not further metabolized and accumulated. This example shows the importance of the substrate specificity of the downstream enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 6A). The gene for the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal/ThdH was introduced into P. chlororaphis by biparental conjugation as described later. Fig. 6 Effect of the introduction of (A) the tryptophan 6-halogenase gene thal/thdH into the pyrrolnitrin producer Pseudomonas chlororaphis on pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis (Seibold et al., 2006) and (B) the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene prnA into the pacidamycin producer Streptomyces coeruleorubidus on pacidamycin biosynthesis (Roy, Gr\u00fcschow, Cairns, & Goss, 2010). 79Flavin-Dependent Halogenases 3.2.1 Introduction of thal/thdH into P. chlororaphis and Isolation of 3-(20-Amino-40-Chlorophenyl)Pyrrole The donor strain E. coli S17-1 containing the plasmid pCIBhisthal (Seibold et al., 2006) and the recipient strain P. chlororaphis ACNwere precultured in 5 mL of HNB medium at 37\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C, respectively, overnight. 100 \u03bcL of each culture were pipetted onto the center of an agar plate containing Pseudomonasminimal medium (PMM; Kirner et al., 1996) and the antibiotic tetracycline (20 \u03bcg/mL). After incubation at 30\u00b0C for 8 h the bacteria were scratched from the plate, diluted, and plated onto PMM agar plates containing tetracyclin for selection of Pseudomonas clones containing the plasmid pCIBhisthal, since under these conditions, only recombinant Pseu-domonas clones were able to grow. The obtained clones could be used for overproduction of the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal/ThdH or for the iso-lation of 3-(20-amino-40-chlorophenyl)pyrrole. For this purpose, P. chlororaphis ACN containing pCIBhisthal was grown in 6 x 1 L of HNBmedium at 30\u00b0C for 96 h. After removal of the cells by centrifugation, the medium was extracted twice with 1.5 L of methyl-tert-butyl ether. The organic extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 2 mL of methanol and loaded onto a LH-20 column and eluted with methanol. Elution of metabolites was monitored at 254 nm. Fractions showing an UV spectrum with a maximum at 303 nm were com-bined and purified further by preparative HPLC using an Eurosphere-100 RP-18 column with water/methanol (35:65) as the eluent. The structure of the purified product was elucidated by HPLC-MS and 1H-NMR. 3.2.2 In Vivo Modification of Biosynthetic Pathways Using Halogenase Genes Roy et al. (2010) used the introduction of the gene of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA from pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis (Kirner et al., 1998) into the pacidamycin producer Streptomyces coeruleorubidus for the modification of the peptide antibiotic pacidamycin. Due to the activity of PrnA, tryptophan was chlorinated to 7-chlorotryptophan and used as a substrate by the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase involved in pacidamycin biosynthesis resulting in the production of chloropacidamycin (Fig. 6B). Runguphan, Qu, and O\u2019Connor (2010) were able to introduce the gene of the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus. They also introduced the flavin reductase gene rebF into the plant which is not neces-sary in the bacterial systems, because there are several flavin reductases in the bacteria which can provide the halogenase with reduced flavin. It is not 80 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. clear, whether transformation of plants with a flavin reductase gene is abso-lutely necessary. Runguphan et al. (2010) obtained halogenated tryptophan-derived alkaloids, some of which were identified as halogenated analogs of known alkaloids produced by the medicinal plant, but due to the subs-trate specificity of downstream enzymes present in the plant, also new chlo-rinated tryptophan-based compounds were formed. It was observed that the indole alkaloid formation from 7-chlorotryptophan inC. roseus is limited by the activity of the tryptophan decarboxylase converting tryptophan to tryptamine. Based on the crystal structure of RebH and thus the knowledge of the exact coordination of its natural substrate tryptophan in the active site of the enzyme, a tyrosine residue interacting with the carboxylic acid group of tryptophan was exchanged by a sterically more demanding try-ptophan residue. This mutation resulted in the preferential halogenation of tryptamine compared to tryptophan. This clearly demonstrates that it is possible to change the substrate specificity of flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases by site-specific mutagenesis. 3.3 Chemical Substitution of Enzymatically Introduced Halogen Atoms Halogen atoms can have a profound influence on the biological activity of compounds and in addition they can serve as a useful handle for further chemical derivatization. Bromine and chlorine atoms can be substituted to afford aryl and heteroaryl analogs. Roy, Goss, Wagner, and Winn (2008) developed a method for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of halogenated tryp-tophans obtained by enzymatic synthesis from the corresponding haloindoles and serine by a simple one-pot reaction (Goss & Newill, 2006). They used the water-soluble phosphine ligand tris(4,6-dimethyl-3-sulfonatophenyl) phosphine trisodium salt (TXPTS) and various arylboronic acids and achieved yields of up to 90%. Since the reaction also worked with small peptides, they adapted the reaction to chlorinated pacidamycin. They achieved the modifi-cation of not only purified chloropacidamycin but also the modification of chloropacidamycin in crude extracts (Roy et al., 2010). Runguphan andO\u2019Connor (2013) described modification of chlorinated alkaloids obtained by in vivo chlorination of the precursor tryptophan by the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH in crude extracts by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling. Chlorinated alkaloids obtained via the exogenous addition of 6-chlorotrytophan to cultures of the plantC. roseus could also be modified by cross-coupling. 81Flavin-Dependent Halogenases 3.4 Modification of the Regioselectivity of Tryptophan Halogenases The regioselectivity of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA could bemodified by site-directed mutagenesis (Lang et al., 2011). Based on the three-dimensional structure of PrnA and the binding of the substrate tryptophan seen in this structure, amino acid residues involved in the binding of the sub-strate via ionic interactions with the amino and carboxylic acid group, and/ or with the indole ring were exchanged. The exchange of a phenylalanine residue shielding the pyrrole ring from attack by the halogenating agent against a much smaller alanine residue led to a modification of the regioselectivity. Obviously, this mutation allowed the substrate a higher degree of flexibility in the active site and resulted in the possibility of an attack of the substrate also in the 5-position in addition to halogenation at the 7-position. The procedure for the construction of the PrnAF103A variant with modified regioselectivity and the use of this mutant for the for-mation of 7-chloro-and 5-chlorotryptophan is described below. 1. The primers used for the construction of the His-tagged PrnAF103A variant by overlap extension PCR were: primer a: 50-GACTCTAGAGGGGATCCCATGAACAAGCC GATCAAGAAT-30 (sense) primer b: 50-GTTCGGCACGTTGCCGGCCAAATGGTAGAA GT-30 (antisense) primer c: 50-ACTTCTACCATTTGGCCGGCAACGTGCC GAAC-30 (sense) primer d: 50-ATCAAGCTTCTACAGGCTTTCCTGCGCTGC GAGCTT-30 (antisense). Mutagenic sites are underlined, and restriction sites are in bold. The template used was pUC-prnA (Dong et al., 2005). 2. The fusion fragment obtained by overlap extension PCR was ligated into pBluescript II SK (+) and introduced into E. coli TG1 by electroporation. 3. For expression of the mutated halogenase gene, the gene was ligated into the E. coli-Pseudomonas shuttle vector pCIBhis (Wynands & van Pe\u0301e, 2004) and introduced into P. fluorescens BL915 \u0394ORF 1\u20134 (Hammer, Hill, Lam, van Pe\u0301e, & Ligon, 1997) by triparental conjugation (Ditta, Stanfield, Corbin, & Helinski, 1980). 4. Purification of His-tagged enzyme was performed by Ni-chelating affinity chromatography using a sepharose FF column. 82 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. 5. Halogenating activity was analyzed using the following reaction mix-ture: 50 \u03bcL enzyme-containing protein solution, 10 mU flavin reduc-tase, 1 \u03bcM FAD, 2.4 mM NADH, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 100 U catalase, and 0.25 mM L-tryptophan in a total volume of 200 \u03bcL in 10 mM potas-sium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After incubation at 30\u00b0C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by incubation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. Denatured pro-teins were removed by centrifugation, and the solution was analyzed by HPLC. One unit of halogenating activity is defined as the formation of 1 \u03bcmol product per min. 6. For identification of the reaction products formed by the PrnAF103A var-iant, a large scale preparation was performed. The assay mixture consisted of 850 \u03bcL enzyme solution in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 50 mU flavin reductase, 10 \u03bcM FAD, 2.4 mM NADH, 12.5 mM NaBr, and 0.25 mM L-tryptophan in a total volume of 1000 \u03bcL. 7. After incubation at 30\u00b0C for 4 h, the reaction was stopped by boiling in a water bath for 5 min. Denatured protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a solid phase extraction column, equilibrated with methanol and water. After washing with 10% metha-nol, the brominated products were eluted with 100% methanol. The eluates of 10 large scale preparations were concentrated in vacuo. 8. The two halogenated products were separated and purified by HPLC using a RP18 column with methanol:water (40:60), 0.1% TFA (v/v) as the eluent. 9. The reaction products were identified by 1H-NMR and ESI-MS. 4. SYNTHESIS OF PCP-BOUND HALOGENASE SUBSTRATES The so far characterized tryptophan halogenases all accept a free sub-strate. However, most of the flavin-dependent halogenases and also most of the nonhaem iron-dependent halogenases require a substrate bound to a peptidyl carrier or acyl carrier protein (Weichold et al., 2016). The prepa-ration of these substrates is highly challenging. Attempts to circumvent the synthetic problems by using the much easier to synthesize SNAC-derivatives of the substrates with the smallN-acetylcysteamine moiety mim-icking the phosphopantetheinyl arm of holo-carrier proteins in the case of thioesterases and NRPS condensation domains (Ehmann, Trauger, Stachelhaus, & Walsh, 2000; Yeh, Kohli, Bruner, & Walsh, 2004) failed, 83Flavin-Dependent Halogenases probably due to the substrate specificity of the halogenases and a proposed conformational change upon interaction with the protein-coupled substrate (Pang, Garneau-Tsodikova, &Tsodikov, 2015). Instead, chemoenzymatically or purely enzymatically synthesized protein-bound substrates were used (Agarwal et al., 2014; Dorrestein, Yeh, Garneau-Tsodikova, Kelleher, & Walsh, 2005; Lin, Van Lanen, & Shen, 2007; Schmartz, Zerbe, Abou-Hadeed, & Robinson, 2014). So far, there are only a few examples for synthesis and use of protein-bound substrates to show halogenase activity. One method has previously been described by Li et al. (2009) for the synthesis of a vancomycin precursor hexapeptide. Only the hexapeptide precursor with a \u03b2-hydroxytyrosine residue at the C-terminus and not the corresponding dipeptide with a \u03b2-hydroxytyrosine residue at the C-terminus was accepted by the FADH2-dependent halogenase VhaA (Schmartz et al., 2014). Synthesis of a PCP-bound \u03b2-tyrosine and halogenation by SgcC3 from C-1027 biosynthesis was shown by Lin, Huang, and Shen (2012). For some nonhaem iron, \u03b1-ketoglutarate-and O2-dependent halogenases, activity has been shown by providing them with enzymatically derived carrier protein-tethered amino acids. Exemplarily, carrier protein-tethered L-threo-nine is used by SyrB2 from syringomycin E biosynthesis and peptide-bound L-allo-isoleucine is accepted by CmaB from coronatine biosynthesis yielding the 4-chloro-derivatives (Vaillancourt, Yeh, Vosburg, O\u2019Connor, & Walsh, 2005; Vaillancourt, Yin, & Walsh, 2005). Trichlorination in position 5 of peptide-bound leucine can be achieved by BarB1 and BarB2 from barbamide biosynthesis (Galonic, Vaillancourt, & Walsh, 2006). For the formation of PCP-tethered pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid substrates, two different main strategies have been used. The first one relies on a fully enzymatic catalysis based on the natural production of pyrrole residues from proline (Fig. 7) (Dorrestein et al., 2005). However, the enzymatic synthesis of PCP-bound pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid requires the heterologous expres-sion of a number of genes, and the purification of the corresponding proteins and enzymes can therefore be rather complicated. The second strategy uses organic synthesis to create a coenzyme A-coupled pyrrolyl residue that is then enzymatically transferred to an apo-PCP by a nonspecific phosphopan-tetheinyl transferase (Garneau-Tsodikova, Stapon, Kahne, & Walsh, 2006). 4.1 Enzymatic Synthesis of Pyrrolyl-S-PCPs For enzymatic synthesis of pyrrolyl-S-PCPs, the PCPs are required in their holo-form, but expression of PCP genes in E. coli yields predominantly the 84 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. apo-PCPs (Gocht & Marahiel, 1994). Thus, it is necessary to attach a phosphopantetheinyl moiety which can be done by treatment with a pho-sphopantetheinyl transferase and coenzyme A or coexpression with the transferase gene. For example, Thomas, Burkart, andWalsh (2002) obtained more than 95% holo-PCP by coexpressing sfp, the gene of an unspecific phosphopantetheinyl transferase from Bacillus subtilis, together with the gene of the PCP, compared to only 25% without coexpression. Enzymatic synthesis of PCP-pyrrole-2-carbothioates was demonstrated for pyoluteorin biosynthesis by Dorrestein et al. (2005) using previously published protocols (Thomas et al., 2002). To generate holo-PCP, apo-PCP (52 \u03bcM) was treated with Sfp (1.1 \u03bcM) and coenzyme A (295 \u03bcM) supplied with MgCl2 (7.1 \u03bcM) in 300 \u03bcL reaction volume and was incubated for 1 h. For adenylation of proline and transfer to the PCP, the enzyme CouN4 from coumermycin biosynthesis was used, and for oxidation to form the pyrrolyl-residue CloN3 from clorobiocin biosynthesis was employed. Fig. 7 Synthetic strategies for generation of pyrrolyl-S-PCPs. (A) The natural biosyn-thetic pathway that can also be reproduced in vitro. (B) Completion of apo-PCP (aPCP) by transferring a phosphopantetheine structure to it forms holo-PCP (hPCP) in vivo and in vitro. (C) and (D) Synthesis of pyrrolyl-S-CoA via pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid chloride or S-phenylpyrrole-2-carbothioate which can be transferred to apo-PCP by a nonspecific phosphopantetheinyl transferase (for conditions of the enzymatic in vitro reactions see text). 85Flavin-Dependent Halogenases The previously provided reaction mixture was used without further purification and supplied with CouN4 (84 \u03bcg/mL), L-proline (4.2 mM), ATP (3.3 mM) followed by CloN3 (2.7 \u03bcM), and FAD (150 \u03bcM) in a total volume of 720 \u03bcL in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 mM TCEP. Incubation at room temperature for 3 h led to the formation of pyrrolyl-S-PCP which could be detected by LC/MS/MS and could be used as the substrate for the halogenase PltA from pyoluteorin biosynthesis. Another protocol for the one-step preparation of pyrrolyl-S-PCP with proteins from the biosynthesis of nargenicin A1 was described by Maharjan et al. (2012). 4.2 Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Pyrrolyl-S-PCPs 4.2.1 Synthesis of Pyrrolyl-S-CoA via Acid Chloride Garneau-Tsodikova et al. (2006) described a method for activation of pyrrole carboxylic acid via the acid chloride. Pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (100 mg) was stirred in dried toluene (5 mL) with a catalytic amount of DMF (7 \u03bcL, 0.1 eq.) which is meant to form the actually chlorinating (chloromethylene)dimethyliminium later on (Fritz & Oehl, 1971; Jugie, Martin, & Smith, 1975). Then thionyl chloride (328 \u03bcL, 5 eq.) was added, and the mixture was heated at 70\u00b0C for 1 h using a reflux condenser. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was concentrated by a rotary evaporator, 5 mL of dry toluene were added and concentrated again. The residue was then dried under vacuum for at least 30 min. It can also be stored at None20\u00b0C under dry conditions for several days. To coenzyme A trilithium salt (20 mg, 1 eq.) in a 1:1 mixture of THF/ H2O with pyridine (1.9 \u03bcL, 1 eq.), pyrrole-2-carbonyl chloride (3.3 mg, 1 eq.) was added. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and then purified by semipreparative HPLC in 50 \u03bcL portions diluted by H2O to 1 mL. For this purpose a 60 min gradient from H2O with 0.1% TFA to 50% MeCN/H2O with 0.1% TFA was used on an Agilent Zorbax 5 \u03bcm 300SB-C18 semiprep HPLC column with a flow rate of 5 mL/min and detection of CoA thioesters at 310 nm. 4.2.2 Synthesis of Pyrrolyl-S-CoA via S-Phenyl Thioates Agarwal et al. (2014) used a traditional peptide-coupling reaction as described by Li et al. (2009) to obtain S-phenyl-pyrrole-2-carbothioate that could be transferred to coenzyme A via a transesterification reaction. To a solution of pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (20 mg) in DMF (500 \u03bcL) PyBOP 86 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. (112 mg, 1.2 eq.), DIPEA (38 \u03bcL, 1.2 eq.) and thiophenol (37 \u03bcL, 2 eq.) were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, quenched by saturated brine, and extracted with ethyl acetate. After drying over MgSO4, the organic phases were concentrated in vacuo and chromatographed on a silica column using a 40:1 mixture of hexane/ethyl acetate which yielded 27% of S-phenyl-pyrrole-2-carbothioate. 4 mg of the S-phenyl-pyrrole-2-carbothioate were dissolved in 200 \u03bcL THF and added to 300 \u03bcL of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.5) containing coenzyme A sodium salt (14 mg, 0.9 eq.). The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature and subsequently chromatographed on a reverse-phase C18 semipreparative HPLC column using a gradient from 5% to 100%MeCNwith 0.1% TFA against H2O with 0.1% TFA over 30 min. Lyophilization of product-containing fractions yielded 7% (2% overall) of the pyrrolyl-CoA thioester. 4.3 Transfer of Pyrrolyl-S-CoA Thioesters to Carrier Proteins and Halogenation of the Substrate A procedure for the transfer of synthesized CoA thioesters to apo-PCP was previously described by Li et al. (2009) for a hexapeptidyl-CoA thioester which works also well for the pyrrolyl-CoA thioester. All components were dissolved in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) reaction buffer and added as follows. The purified apo-PCP (120 \u03bcM) was supplied with the pyrrolyl-CoA thioester (100 \u03bcM), the unspecific phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp (5 \u03bcM) and MgCl2 (50 mM). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and then purified by HPLC. Agarwal et al. (2014) did not purify the product but directly used the reac-tion mixture for enzymatic halogenation. To 100 \u03bcL of the PCP-pyrrole-2-carbothioate-containing mixture 5 mM NADPH, 100 \u03bcM FAD, 100 mM KBr for bromination, 20 \u03bcM halogenase, and 6 \u03bcM SsuE flavin reductase were added in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The reaction was maintained by periodic addition of additional NADPH (5 mM every hour). So far, no kinetic data for the halogenation of PCP-tethered pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid could be obtained due to the very low activity of these reactions. 4.4 Release of Halogenated Pyrrole-2-Carboxylic Acid from PCPs Although PCP-coupled substrates and products can be analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Garneau-Tsodikova et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 2002) or 87Flavin-Dependent Halogenases LC/MS/MS after proteolytic digestion (Agarwal et al., 2014; Dorrestein et al., 2006), in many cases a release from the PCP is desired. Thomas et al. (2002) described a method to release the products from the PCP hydrolytically by treatment with KOH. For this purpose the proteins from a sample (500 \u03bcL) were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid up to 5\u201310% (w/v) and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was then washed twice with H2O and resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of 0.1 M KOH. Incu-bation at 65\u00b0C for 15 min, addition of TFA for neutralization, and removal of precipitated proteins by centrifugation or filtration lead to halogenated pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid. However, in our hands release by KOH treat-ment did not work satisfactorily; we could hardly detect any released pyrrol-2-carboxylic acid. Another strategy inspired by Li et al. (2009) was employed by Schmartz et al. (2014) who treated the vancomycin precursor hexapeptide-PCP conjugate with 1/10 volume of an aqueous hydrazine solution (25% v/v) at 30\u00b0C for 30 min to lyse the thioester bond freeing the peptide hydrazide. However, in our hands this did not lead to detectable amounts of released pyrrole carbonyl hydrazide. Dorrestein et al. (2005) used the type II thioesterase TycF from tyroci-dine biosynthesis (Mootz & Marahiel, 1997) for the enzymatic release of pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid from the PCP according to a protocol from Yeh et al. (2004), by incubating the PCP-pyrrole-2-carbothioate in 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5 with 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM TCEP with 10 \u03bcM TycF to release the substrate. 5. CONCLUSIONS The lack of stability of flavin-dependent halogenases under reaction conditions poses a serious problem for their use in industrial applications. To improve enzyme stability, the construction of mutants is required. However, for screening of mutants, the methods available for high-throughput screening have to be improved considerably, especially in their general applicability. Elucidation of the reason for the loss of activity should allow the modification of the enzymes in such a way that they cannot be inactivated anymore. The substrate scope of tryptophan halogenases has been broadened substantially. Error-prone PCR and site-directed mutagen-esis in combination with high-throughput assays should allow the improve-ment of halogenating activity toward substrates, now only halogenated with a very low activity and should thus tremendously increase the suitability 88 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al. of halogenases for industrial application. The in vivo use of halogenases will lead to the production of novel compounds with new or improved biolog-ical activities and the possibility to exchange the halogen substituents via cross-coupling reactions increases the possibility for the formation of novel compounds tremendously. The requirement of protein-bound substrates hampers the use of many halogenases in in vitro reactions enormously, since the amount of substrate obtained by these syntheses is rather low as well as the activities of the enzymes. Here, the in vivo use seems to be a good alternative. The future for enzymatic halogenation reactions looks very promising, especially with a steadily increasing number of potent groups working on this subject.

        "The application of flavin-dependent halogenases is hampered by their lack of stability under reaction conditions. However, first attempts to improve halogenase stability by error-prone PCR have resulted in mutants with higher temperature stability. To facilitate the screening for mutants with higher activity, a high-throughput assay was developed. Formation of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) of halogenases has increased halogenase lifetime by a factor of about 10, and CLEAs have been used to produce halo-genated tryptophan in gram scale. Analyses of the substrate specificity of tryptophan halogenases have shown that they accept a much broader range of substrates than previously thought. The introduction of tryptophan halogenase genes into bacteria and plants led to the in vivo formation of peptides containing halogenated tryptophan",

        "or novel tryptophan-derived alkaloids, respectively. The halogen atoms in these com-pounds could be chemically exchanged against other substituents by cross-coupling reactions leading to novel compounds. Site-directed mutageneses have been used to modify the substrate specificity and the regioselectivity of flavin-dependent trypto-phan halogenases. Since many flavin-dependent halogenases only accept protein-bound substrates, enzymatic and chemoenzymatic syntheses for protein-tethered substrates were developed, and the synthesized substrates were used in enzymatic halogenation reactions.",
        "1. INTRODUCTION Flavin-dependent halogenases are a promising group of halogenating",
        "enzymes. They catalyze halogenation reactions with high regioselectivity and without the formation of by-products except water and thus provide the opportunity for industrial-scale production of chlorinated pharmaceuticals and organic compounds. However, the low stability of halogenases under reaction conditions, leading to fast inactivation, hampers their application in industry. Thus, it is of great importance to increase their stability under reaction conditions. While their high substrate specificity is of advantage in their natural environment, it is a disadvantage for their extensive application and therefore needs to be broadened. Furthermore, all so far known flavin-dependent halogenases have a rather low reactivity with kcat-values around 1\u20137 minNone1 which also needs considerable improvement. Flavin-dependent halogenases are a two-component system consisting of a flavin reductase providing the actual halogenase with FADH2 produced from NADH and FAD. For industrial application of the two-component system, effective regeneration of the reducing agents is also required. The best-investigated flavin-dependent halogenases are the tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA from pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis (Keller et al., 2000) and RebH from rebeccamycin biosynthesis (Sanchez et al., 2002), the tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH frompyrroindomycin B biosynthesis (Zehner et al., 2005), and the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal/ThdH from thienodolin biosynthesis (Milbredt, Patallo, & van Pe\u0301e, 2014; Seibold et al., 2006) which all accept L-and D-tryptophan as their natural substrates. Additionally, work on halogenases catalyzing the halo-genation of peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-bound pyrrole carboxylic acid or PCP-tethered peptides showed how complex natural substrates of halogenases can be produced by enzymatic or chemical synthesis. The last 10 years have seen considerable progress toward the understanding and improvement of the properties of halogenases which will be described later.",

        "Flavin-dependent halogenases were found to completely lose their activity already 2\u20133 h after the start of the reaction (Fig. 1). One possible reason for this instability could be a simple temperature sensitivity, but there is also the possibility of an altered protein structure due to reaction with the halogenat-ing intermediate or other side products formed at the active site. The halo-genating agent produced by the enzymes is hypohalous acid which is directed to the substrate through a 10-A\u030a long tunnel (Dong et al., 2005). This hypohalous acid might not only react with the substrate but also with amino acids located along the tunnel. For example, the reaction of amino acids with hypochlorous acid can lead to formation of chloramines, 3-chlorotyrosines or 3-hydroxytryptophans (Stadtman & Levine, 2006). On the other hand, the reaction of FADH2 with oxygen can lead to the for-mation of hydrogen peroxide or even superoxide anion radical. These could in turn react with the halogenase and damage the protein structure and",

The amount of tryptophan at the start of the reaction was 400 nmol for PyrH and Thal/ThdH and 50 nmol for PrnA. The reason for the observed decrease in formed product by PyrH and Thal/ThdH after 2.5\u20133 h is not known.",

        "thereby result in its loss of activity. Product inhibition was also considered as a possible reason for the loss of activity during incubation under reaction conditions. Up to now, there are no studies dealing with the mechanisms of inactivation of flavin-dependent halogenases. Nevertheless, the last few years have seen investigations dealing with ways to increase the stability of flavin-dependent halogenases. Muffler, Kuetchou Ngnigha, and Ulber (2010) characterized the acti-vity of the tryptophan-5-halogenase PyrH from Streptomyces rugosporus LL-42D005 which is involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic pyrroindomycin B (Zehner et al., 2005). Checking the deactivation con-stants of PyrH, they recognized the instability of PyrH at 30\u00b0C. After 3 h at this temperature, the enzyme showed nearly no activity, anymore. PyrH was longer active at lower temperatures (after 6 h of incubation, 70% activity at 18\u00b0C and 90% activity at 0\u00b0C were left). For this reason, they recommended a lower temperature for the enzyme activity assay than the normally used 30\u00b0C. However, this results in a decrease of the activity of the halogenases, since most of them have their temperature opti-mum around 30\u00b0C, eg, PrnA at 30\u00b0C (Flecks et al., 2008) and Thal/ThdH at 32\u00b0C (Ernyei, 2008). The addition of compounds known to stabilize enzymes such as glycerol, glucose, or sucrose had no stabilizing effect under reaction conditions (Fig. 2).",
        "Fig. 2 Time course of conversion of tryptophan to 6-chlorotryptophan by Thal/ThdH in comparison with reactions containing glycerol (2.2%), glucose (250 mg/mL), and sucrose (250 mg/mL), respectively. The amount of tryptophan at the start of reactionwas 60 nmol.",
        "68 K.-H. van P\u00e9e et al.",
        "Investigations into the linearity of the reaction of the three tryptophan halogenases PrnA, PyrH, and Thal/ThdH showed that the reaction veloc-ities of these enzymes are only linear for a short period of time of about 30 min and then start to decline. This is of high importance for the deter-mination of kinetic data (Fig. 1). Therefore, kinetic data should always be taken in the first minutes of the reaction to be sure to stay in the linear region. However, since activity measurements have to be done by HPLC analysis, rather high amounts of the enzymes are required to make sure that the product peaks are high enough for quantification.",
        "The first problem to solve when working with flavin-dependent halogenases is the issue of overexpression of the halogenase gene. Until now, nobody has achieved to show halogenating activity in a wild-type strain producing a halogenase. Only after high overexpression of the halogenase gene and production of soluble halogenase, halogenating activity can be detected. Overexpression of halogenase genes in soluble form in E. coli seems to be quite problematic and forced the group of Jared Lewis to construct a maltose-binding protein halogenase fusion protein to obtain enough of the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH and the flavin reductase RebF from rebeccamycin biosynthesis in Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes for their work (Payne, Andorfer, & Lewis, 2013; Sanchez et al., 2002). In our hands, expression of halogenase genes from different sources in Pseudomonas strains works excellent with extremely high overexpression (Keller et al., 2000; Seibold et al., 2006; Zehner et al., 2005), although sometimes the clones completely lose their ability to express the genes. In these cases, fresh trans-formation of Pseudomonas with the plasmids isolated from E. coli, not from Pseudomonas, will solve the problem.",
        "During their further work with RebH, Poor, Andorfer, and Lewis (2014) also encountered the problem of instability. During the enzyme reaction in a preparative scale, an extensive precipitation of RebH occur-red. In their opinion, an increase of thermostability could lead to a longer lifetime of RebH, an increase of stress tolerance and might also enable higher reaction temperatures. Due to the lack of a high-throughput assay, every single E. coli clone obtained by error-prone PCR had to be grown separately, lysed, and was then incubated at elevated tempera-tures, followed by incubation under reaction conditions for 16 and up to 48 h, and analyzed for overall product formation by HPLC. The mutations of variants showing higher product formation after this treat-ment were combined using overlap extension PCR. This procedure was repeated twice, and the most promising variants of RebH were characterized in detail.",
        "69Flavin-Dependent Halogenases",
        "The two RebH variants 3-LR and 3-LSR showed the best conversion and were further characterized. The mutant RebH variant 3-LR showed a 5\u00b0C higher optimal temperature and 100% more product than wild-type RebH at its optimal temperature. Additionally, the yield of product for the conversion of several other substrates was higher, compared to the wild-type enzyme. An examination of the reaction profiles showed an about threefold longer lifetime of 3-LSR than the wild-type enzyme. Fur-thermore, steady-state kinetic data were collected at 21\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C for wild-type RebH and the mutant 3-LSR. Both enzymes show a similar kcat/Km at 40\u00b0C, whereas the wild type has a significantly higher kcat/Km at 21\u00b0C. This is due to a significantly lower catalytic efficiency of the 3-LSR mutant at 21\u00b0C (Table 1; Poor et al., 2014). Thus, the higher pro-duct yield of the RebH variant is due to a longer lifetime, compensating a lower catalytic activity. This shows that directed evolution is one way to create better halogenases but seems not to be the most efficient.",
        "2.2 Stabilization of Halogenases by Formation of Cross-Linked Enzyme Aggregates (CLEAs)",
        "Characterization of kinetic parameters such as Km, kcat and total turnover numbers of different tryptophan halogenases showed that in vitro enzyma-tic halogenation is an inefficient reaction (Table 2) which is in a large part due to the instability of the halogenases (Dong et al., 2005; Frese, Guzowska, Vo\u00df, & Sewald, 2014; Seibold et al., 2006; Yeh, Garneau, & Walsh, 2005; Zehner et al., 2005). Thus, the biotechnological application of these enzymes is still restricted. Enzyme immobilization has been proven as an efficient method to deal with enzyme stability problems. In contrast to soluble enzymes, immobilized enzymes are more stable, easy to handle, and facilitate efficient recovery and reuse.

        "The first findings about the substrate specificity of flavin-dependent trypto-phan halogenases were published in 2001 for the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA from P. fluorescens BL915 (Ho\u0308lzer, Burd, Rei\u00dfig, & van Pe\u0301e, 2001).

        "was achieved. With all the compounds different from tryptophan, haloge-nation proceeded with a relaxed regioselectivity and chlorination mostly occurred at the electronically most activated 2-position of the indole ring. In some cases, even a mixture of different chlorinated products or dichlorination was observed. These findings led to the conclusion that only the natural substrate tryptophan can be bound correctly in the active site of the enzyme PrnA to allow regioselective chlorination and that this might also be the case for other flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases from other secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways. During the following years, a multitude of new halogenase genes, among them the genes of several flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases, was isolated from secondary metabolite gene clusters. In a few cases, the genes were heterologously expressed, the enzymes characterized in regard to their natural substrates and the kinetic parameters of the reaction were determined (Weichold, Milbredt, & van Pe\u0301e, 2016). In some cases also the 3D structures of the enzymes were solved (Bitto et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2005; Yeh, Blasiak, Koglin, Drennan, & Walsh, 2007; Zhu et al., 2009). No further investiga-tions were published on the substrate specificity of tryptophan halogenases until more than one decade later. The next data on this issue were published by Payne et al. (2013) who described the chlorination and also the bromi-nation of indole, several tryptophan derivatives and also less structurally related compounds like tryptoline and the two differently monosubstituted naphthalenes, 2-aminonaphthalene and 1-hydroxynaphthalene. In 2014, Frese et al. (2014) described the conversion of several fluoro-, methyl-, amino-, and hydroxy-substituted tryptophan derivatives by RebH. Exten-ding the biocatalytic scope of tryptophan halogenases even further, Shepherd et al. (2015) showed that the tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH and the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA are not only able to convert tryptophan derivatives to their respective halogenated analogs but also accept nonindolic substrates such as the aniline derivatives kynurenine and anthranilamide. All the mentioned groups working on the issue of the conversion of compounds others than tryptophan by tryptophan halogenases described different experiments to obtain new halogenated compounds. The protocols differ in expression hosts and fusion tags for pro-tein purification. The reaction conditions during the large scale conversions as well as the methods used for quenching of the reactions and product puri-fication are different which makes it quite difficult to compare the existing protocols. A short overview summarizing the reaction conditions applied for the large-scale conversion of different compounds is given in Table 3.",

        "It has been shown that the substrate specificity of tryptophan halogenases is not as high as originally assumed and that it is even possible to create variants of the native enzymes with modified substrate specificity. Unfortu-nately, the construction of such improved halogenases is severely hampered by the issue of mutant screening. Every single clone of a mutant library needs to be grown, followed by cell lysis and incubation of the cell-free extracts with potential substrates and finally the enzyme assays need to be analyzed for possible conversion products by HPLC or other methods. This makes the screening of mutant libraries for halogenases accepting new sub-strates a really tough challenge. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to develop high-throughput techniques using simple detection methods. A publication by Hoshford, Shepherd, Micklefield, and Wong (2014) describes such a high-throughput assay for arylamine halogenation in aqueous solutions. This colorimetric assay is based on a peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed in situ oxidation of 4-methyl-catechol and the following addition of chlorinated or nonhalogenated arylamines (benzoquinone\u2013 amine-coupling reaction) which can be analyzed spectrophotometrically due to a shift of the absorbance maxima of the halogenated compounds in comparison to their nonhalogenated analogs (Fig. 5). Unfortunately, this reaction requires the presence of an arylamine functionality in the molecule which makes this assay suitable for only a limited number of potential halogenase substrates.",

Although this strain still contained the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene prnA, overexpression of the tryptophan 6-halogenase gene thal/thdH was so high that all available tryptophan was converted to 6-chlorotryptophan thus no 7-chlorotryptophan was available for pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis. How-ever, 6-chlorotryptophan formed by the reaction of Thal/ThdH was accepted as a substrate by the second enzyme in the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic pathway, PrnB, resulting in the formation of the phenylpyrrole derivative 3-(20-amino-40-chlorophenyl)pyrrole. But the next enzyme, the mon-odechloroaminopyrrolnitrin 3-halogenase (PrnC; Hohaus et al., 1997; Kirner et al., 1998) did not accept this compound as a substrate which was thus not further metabolized and accumulated. This example shows the importance of the substrate specificity of the downstream enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 6A). The gene for the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal/ThdH was introduced into P. chlororaphis by biparental conjugation as described later.",

After incubation at 30\u00b0C for 8 h the bacteria were scratched from the plate, diluted, and plated onto PMM agar plates containing tetracyclin for selection of Pseudomonas clones containing the plasmid pCIBhisthal, since under these conditions, only recombinant Pseu-domonas clones were able to grow. The obtained clones could be used for overproduction of the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal/ThdH or for the iso-lation of 3-(20-amino-40-chlorophenyl)pyrrole. For this purpose, P. chlororaphis ACN containing pCIBhisthal was grown in 6 x 1 L of HNBmedium at 30\u00b0C for 96 h. After removal of the cells by centrifugation, the medium was extracted twice with 1.5 L of methyl-tert-butyl ether. The organic extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness in vacuo.

Due to the activity of PrnA, tryptophan was chlorinated to 7-chlorotryptophan and used as a substrate by the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase involved in pacidamycin biosynthesis resulting in the production of chloropacidamycin (Fig. 6B). Runguphan, Qu, and O\u2019Connor (2010) were able to introduce the gene of the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus. They also introduced the flavin reductase gene rebF into the plant which is not neces-sary in the bacterial systems, because there are several flavin reductases in the bacteria which can provide the halogenase with reduced flavin.

(2010) obtained halogenated tryptophan-derived alkaloids, some of which were identified as halogenated analogs of known alkaloids produced by the medicinal plant, but due to the subs-trate specificity of downstream enzymes present in the plant, also new chlo-rinated tryptophan-based compounds were formed. It was observed that the indole alkaloid formation from 7-chlorotryptophan inC. roseus is limited by the activity of the tryptophan decarboxylase converting tryptophan to tryptamine. Based on the crystal structure of RebH and thus the knowledge of the exact coordination of its natural substrate tryptophan in the active site of the enzyme, a tyrosine residue interacting with the carboxylic acid group of tryptophan was exchanged by a sterically more demanding try-ptophan residue. This mutation resulted in the preferential halogenation of tryptamine compared to tryptophan. This clearly demonstrates that it is possible to change the substrate specificity of flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases by site-specific mutagenesis.",

Bromine and chlorine atoms can be substituted to afford aryl and heteroaryl analogs. Roy, Goss, Wagner, and Winn (2008) developed a method for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of halogenated tryp-tophans obtained by enzymatic synthesis from the corresponding haloindoles and serine by a simple one-pot reaction (Goss & Newill, 2006). They used the water-soluble phosphine ligand tris(4,6-dimethyl-3-sulfonatophenyl) phosphine trisodium salt (TXPTS) and various arylboronic acids and achieved yields of up to 90%. Since the reaction also worked with small peptides, they adapted the reaction to chlorinated pacidamycin. They achieved the modifi-cation of not only purified chloropacidamycin but also the modification of chloropacidamycin in crude extracts (Roy et al., 2010).",

        "The regioselectivity of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA could bemodified by site-directed mutagenesis (Lang et al., 2011). Based on the three-dimensional structure of PrnA and the binding of the substrate tryptophan seen in this structure, amino acid residues involved in the binding of the sub-strate via ionic interactions with the amino and carboxylic acid group, and/ or with the indole ring were exchanged. The exchange of a phenylalanine residue shielding the pyrrole ring from attack by the halogenating agent against a much smaller alanine residue led to a modification of the regioselectivity. Obviously, this mutation allowed the substrate a higher degree of flexibility in the active site and resulted in the possibility of an attack of the substrate also in the 5-position in addition to halogenation at the 7-position. The procedure for the construction of the PrnAF103A variant with modified regioselectivity and the use of this mutant for the for-mation of 7-chloro-and 5-chlorotryptophan is described below. 1.

However, most of the flavin-dependent halogenases and also most of the nonhaem iron-dependent halogenases require a substrate bound to a peptidyl carrier or acyl carrier protein (Weichold et al., 2016). The prepa-ration of these substrates is highly challenging. Attempts to circumvent the synthetic problems by using the much easier to synthesize SNAC-derivatives of the substrates with the smallN-acetylcysteamine moiety mim-icking the phosphopantetheinyl arm of holo-carrier proteins in the case of thioesterases and NRPS condensation domains (Ehmann, Trauger, Stachelhaus, & Walsh, 2000; Yeh, Kohli, Bruner, & Walsh, 2004) failed,",
        "83Flavin-Dependent Halogenases",
        "probably due to the substrate specificity of the halogenases and a proposed conformational change upon interaction with the protein-coupled substrate (Pang, Garneau-Tsodikova, &Tsodikov, 2015). Instead, chemoenzymatically or purely enzymatically synthesized protein-bound substrates were used (Agarwal et al., 2014; Dorrestein, Yeh, Garneau-Tsodikova, Kelleher, & Walsh, 2005; Lin, Van Lanen, & Shen, 2007; Schmartz, Zerbe, Abou-Hadeed, & Robinson, 2014). So far, there are only a few examples for synthesis and use of protein-bound substrates to show halogenase activity. One method has previously been described by Li et al. (2009) for the synthesis of a vancomycin precursor hexapeptide. Only the hexapeptide precursor with a \u03b2-hydroxytyrosine residue at the C-terminus and not the corresponding dipeptide with a \u03b2-hydroxytyrosine residue at the C-terminus was accepted by the FADH2-dependent halogenase VhaA (Schmartz et al., 2014). Synthesis of a PCP-bound \u03b2-tyrosine and halogenation by SgcC3 from C-1027 biosynthesis was shown by Lin, Huang, and Shen (2012). For some nonhaem iron, \u03b1-ketoglutarate-and O2-dependent halogenases, activity has been shown by providing them with enzymatically derived carrier protein-tethered amino acids. Exemplarily, carrier protein-tethered L-threo-nine is used by SyrB2 from syringomycin E biosynthesis and peptide-bound L-allo-isoleucine is accepted by CmaB from coronatine biosynthesis yielding the 4-chloro-derivatives (Vaillancourt, Yeh, Vosburg, O\u2019Connor, & Walsh, 2005; Vaillancourt, Yin, & Walsh, 2005). Trichlorination in position 5 of peptide-bound leucine can be achieved by BarB1 and BarB2 from barbamide biosynthesis (Galonic, Vaillancourt, & Walsh, 2006). For the formation of PCP-tethered pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid substrates, two different main strategies have been used. The first one relies on a fully enzymatic catalysis based on the natural production of pyrrole residues from proline (Fig. 7) (Dorrestein et al., 2005). However, the enzymatic synthesis of PCP-bound pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid requires the heterologous expres-sion of a number of genes, and the purification of the corresponding proteins and enzymes can therefore be rather complicated. The second strategy uses organic synthesis to create a coenzyme A-coupled pyrrolyl residue that is then enzymatically transferred to an apo-PCP by a nonspecific phosphopan-tetheinyl transferase (Garneau-Tsodikova, Stapon, Kahne, & Walsh, 2006).",

(2002) described a method to release the products from the PCP hydrolytically by treatment with KOH. For this purpose the proteins from a sample (500 \u03bcL) were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid up to 5\u201310% (w/v) and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was then washed twice with H2O and resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of 0.1 M KOH.

However, for screening of mutants, the methods available for high-throughput screening have to be improved considerably, especially in their general applicability. Elucidation of the reason for the loss of activity should allow the modification of the enzymes in such a way that they cannot be inactivated anymore. The substrate scope of tryptophan halogenases has been broadened substantially. Error-prone PCR and site-directed mutagen-esis in combination with high-throughput assays should allow the improve-ment of halogenating activity toward substrates, now only halogenated with a very low activity and should thus tremendously increase the suitability",

The in vivo use of halogenases will lead to the production of novel compounds with new or improved biolog-ical activities and the possibility to exchange the halogen substituents via cross-coupling reactions increases the possibility for the formation of novel compounds tremendously. The requirement of protein-bound substrates hampers the use of many halogenases in in vitro reactions enormously, since the amount of substrate obtained by these syntheses is rather low as well as the activities of the enzymes.
