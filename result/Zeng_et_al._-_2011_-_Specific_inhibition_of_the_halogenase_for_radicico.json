NaBr, but not NaF, NaCl or NaI, inhibited the biosynthesis of 1 in P. chlamydosporia in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by the formation chlorine-lacking monocillins II\u2013V (2\u20135), indicating that the dedicated halogenase, Rdc2 had been inhib-ited. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that transcription of rdc2 was selectively inhibited by Br-, whereas the putative P450 epoxidase gene, rdc4, was not affected. Keywords Bromide None Halogenase None Inhibition None Radicicol biosynthesis None Transcription Introduction Filamentous fungi are a rich source of pharmaceuti-cally important products. Whole-genome sequencing projects indicate that the biosynthetic potential of fungi has been underestimated as there are many silent or cryptic genes that could be investigated for the production of new molecules (Scherlach and Hertweck 2009). In addition, media composition, such as halogen salts and growth conditions, also have a significant impact on secondary metabolite profiles thereby providing new opportunities to access untapped chemical diversity of fungi (Parana-gama et al. 2007; Stander et al. 2000; Wijeratne et al. 2010). However, the mechanisms by which fungal biosynthetic pathways are influenced by medium components and culture conditions are poorly under-stood, which has hampered our understanding of fungal secondary metabolism. Thus, studies on regulation of biosynthetic enzymes are required to further explore fungal systems for diverse natural products. Radicicol (1, Fig. 1a) is a chlorine-containing polyketide produced by Pochonia chlamydosporia (Shinonaga et al. 2009) and several other filamentous fungi (Ayer et al. 1980; Evans and White 1966; McCapra et al. 1964). It has significant antifungal (Fujita et al. 1999) and anticancer activities (Shimada et al. 1995), and is a potent heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor (Turbyville et al. 2006). It belongs to a family of fungal resorcylic acid lactones (RALS) such as hypothemycin and zearalenone. The biosyn-thetic gene clusters of 1 from two producing strains, P. chlamydosporia (Reeves et al. 2008) and Chaeto-mium chiversii (Wang et al. 2008), have been recently sequenced. Both gene clusters contain four key biosynthetic genes encoding reducing polyketide Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10529-010-0427-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

A recent research on hypothemycin biosynthesis (Zhou et al. 2010) has demonstrated that assembly of the RAL structure is the result of cooperative actions of the dedicated R-PKS and NR-PKS. Thus, a similar mechanism can be proposed for the formation of the core structure of 1 by Rdc5 and Rdc1 in P. chlamydosporia, with further modifications by two post-PKS tailoring enzymes Rdc2 (chlorination) and Rdc4 (epoxidation) (Fig. 1b). Although the gene sequence information of the radicicol biosynthetic gene cluster is available, how the radicicol biosynthetic enzymes are regulated has not been well understood yet. In the present paper, we report the effect of halides on radicicol biosynthesis and for the first time demonstrate specific inhibition of the dedicated halogenase by bromide at the transcriptional level. Materials and methods Strains, media and culture conditions Pochonia chlamydosporia ATCC 16683 was used. Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Strat-agene, CA, USA) was routinely grown in LB medium at 37NoneC and used for expression of Rdc2. Effect of halides on radicicol biosynthesis Pochonia chlamydosporia was grown on potato/ dextrose/agar (PDA) medium alone or supplemented with NaF, NaCl, NaBr or NaI at 5 and 50 mM at 30NoneC for 7 days, followed by extraction of the cells with methanol. The extracts were dried under reduced pressure, and analyzed and quantified on an Agilent Single Quad HPLC\u2013MS using a Zorbax SB-C18 reversed-phase analytical column (5 lm, 150 9 4.6 mm2) at 280 nm. A gradient of acetonitrile/water (10\u201390%, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid was programmed over 25 min at 1 ml min-1. Extraction and isolation of monocillin IV (4) Pochonia chlamydosporia was grown on 600 ml PDA medium supplemented with 50 mM NaBr in 20 Petri dishes. The cultures were incubated at 30NoneC for 7 days and then extracted 3 times with 1 l of methanol. After evaporation of the solvent, 2.8 g residue was obtained. The extract was then separated on a 25 g silica gel column (63\u2013200 lm, EMD Chemical Inc., Germany), sequentially eluted with hexane/acetone (8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, v/v) and then pure acetone. 4 was detected in the hexane\u2013acetone (4:1 and 2:1, v/v) eluents. A total of 10.5 mg of 4 was isolated in pure form. Monocillin IV (4): Colorless crystal. ESIMS (?) m/z 319 [M?H]?. 1H and 13C NMR data are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of transcription of rdc2 and rdc4 To identify whether the inhibition of biosynthesis of 1 by NaBr is due to the inhibitory effect on transcription Fig. 1 a Structure of radicicol (1) and the chlorine-lacking metabolites 2\u20135; b proposed biosynthetic pathway of 1 334 Biotechnol Lett (2011) 33:333\u2013338 123 of the tailoring enzymes, RT-PCR analysis was performed. P. chlamydosporia was grown in 50 ml of potato/dextrose broth at 30NoneC and 250 rpm, with and without 50 mM NaBr. After 7 days, the cultures were filtered. The supernatants were extracted with ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the solvent, the extracts were analyzed by HPLC under the same conditions as described above. The mycelia were ground in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the ground mycelia using a RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA), which was subsequently used as the template to synthesize the cDNA using a SuperScript III First-Strand cDNA Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Specific primers includ-ing rdc2-50-NdeI (AACATATGTCGGTACCCAAGT CTTG) and rdc2-30-HindIII (AAAAGCTTTCAAACT TTGTTGAGGCCAA) were used to clone the rdc2 gene. Similarly, rdc4-50-NdeI (AACATATGAATG TATCGCCTCAGTT) and rdc4-30-EcoRI (AAGAA TTCTCAATCTGCTCTCTCATGCT) were used for amplification of rdc4. Pure water and the genomic DNA were used in the PCR analysis as negative and positive controls, respectively. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) was used for cloning. The PCR program for ampli-fication of both genes included an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 98NoneC, a 20-cycle touchdown program (30 s denaturation at 98NoneC, 30 s annealing at temperatures reduced by -0.5NoneC/cycle from 75NoneC to 65NoneC, 70 s extension at 72NoneC), an additional 20-cycle regular program (30 s denaturation at 98NoneC, 30 s annealing at 65NoneC, 70 s extension at 72NoneC), and a 10-min final extension at 72NoneC. The PCR products were checked by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Effect of NaBr on expression of rdc2 in E. coli The intron-free rdc2 gene cloned from the cDNA was ligated into pET28a vector between NdeI and HindIII to yield an expression plasmid pJZ54. This plasmid was then transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL and the enzyme was expressed at 28NoneC for 16 h after induction by 200 lM IPTG. To test whether the expression of rdc2 in E. coli is influenced by bromide, 50 mM NaBr was added into the LB medium with IPTG when the OD600 reached 0.4\u20130.6. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The lysates were then centrifuged at 15,0009g for 10 min. Both the resulting supernatants (soluble proteins) and pellets (insoluble proteins that were dissolved in 8 M urea) were checked by SDS-PAGE. Results and discussion Effect of four different halides on radicicol biosynthesis Halides have significant effects on the production of ochratoxins in Aspergillus ochraceus (Stander et al. 2000). To test whether halides can influence radicicol biosynthesis, NaF, NaCl, NaBr or NaI were added into PDA cultures of P. chlamydosporia, at 5 and 50 mM. None of the halides inhibited growth but the yield of 1 was significantly inhibited by NaBr (Table 1). HPLC of the products is shown in Fig. 2 showing the production of four new metabolites, 2\u20135. The same inhibition was observed with KBr, indi-cating that it is Br-that plays a key role in the inhibition of radicicol biosynthesis. We next identified what new metabolites were synthesized when radicicol biosynthesis was inhib-ited. ESI\u2013MS data revealed that molecular weights of 2\u20135 were 316, 332, 318, and 334, respectively. None of these compounds showed the characteristic ion Table 1 The yields of 1 in P. chlamydosporia on PDA med-ium with different sodium halides Medium Yield (mg l-1) Control 291 \u00b1 16 5 mM NaI 290 \u00b1 12 50 mM NaI 228 \u00b1 20 5 mM NaBr 30 \u00b1 3 50 mM NaBr 3.6 \u00b1 0.3 5 mM NaCl 286 \u00b1 21 50 mM NaCl 257 \u00b1 11 ? 5 mM NaF 285 \u00b1 17 50 mM NaF 274 \u00b1 13 The 7-day old PDA cultures of P. chlamydosporia were minced and extracted with methanol for three times. After evaporation of the solvent, the samples were re-dissolved in methanol and analyzed by HPLC at 280 nm. A standard curve of 1 was established for quantification of the radicicol yields in the control (blank PDA) and cultures supplemented with different halides. Results represent the mean of three independent experiments Biotechnol Lett (2011) 33:333\u2013338 335 123 peaks (3:1) of mono-chlorinated molecules, indicat-ing that they are chlorine-lacking metabolites. Based on the corresponding UV and MS spectra, 2\u20135 were predicted to be monocillins II\u2013V (Fig. 1a) (Shinonaga et al. 2009; Wijeratne et al. 2004), which have been previously isolated from various fungi (Ayer et al. 1980; Shinonaga et al. 2009; Wijeratne et al. 2004). We also scaled up the culture and isolated 4 for complete NMR analysis. The low field carbon signals including the C-10 keto group, C-18 lactone group, 6 aromatic carbons, and two olefinic carbons, were present in the 13C NMR spectrum, while no epoxide signals were observed. In the 1H NMR spectrum, two meta-coupled aromatic protons (H-13 and H-15, J = 2.4 Hz) were present at d 6.26 and 6.15, respectively, confirming the absence of Cl in the molecule. Based on the 1H-1H COSY and HMBC spectra, the double bond can be located between C-4 and C-5 and thus 4 was characterized as monocillin IV. All the carbon and proton signals were assigned (Supplementary Table 1), which were in agreement with those previously reported (Shinonaga et al. 2009). Simi-larly, 2, 3 and 5 were confirmed to be monocillins II, III and V (Fig. 1a), respectively, by comparison of the NMR data with the literature (Shinonaga et al. 2009; Wijeratne et al. 2004). Because of the inhibition of radicicol biosynthesis and simultaneous production of four chlorine-lacking metabolites 2\u20135, it can be concluded that the dedicated halogenase Rdc2 has been inhibited by NaBr. Similar to this discovery, a previous study also reported that large amounts of bromide (100 mM CaBr2) can alter the secondary metabolism of another fungus, Lachnum papyraceum, to generate a different major metabolite papyracillic acid, although the mechanism still remains unknown (Shan et al. 1996). Effect of bromide on Rdc2 expression in P. chlamydosporia Inhibition of Rdc2 in P. chlamydosporia by bromide can be a result of regulation of enzyme activity or protein synthesis. In vitro enzymatic studies have shown that Br-can be used as a halogen donor by Rdc2 and has no effect on the enzymatic activity (Zeng and Zhan 2010). Thus, the possibility of activity inhibition can be ruled out and protein synthesis of Rdc2 in P. chlamydosporia must be inhibited by bromide. Protein synthesis can be regulated at the transcriptional or translational level. To find out whether transcription of rdc2 is affected by bromide, we used RT-PCR to analyze mRNA synthesis of rdc2 by P. chlamydosporia. The results (Fig. 3a) showed that no mRNA transcript of rdc2 was synthesized in the presence of 50 mM NaBr, thus confirming that expression of rdc2 was inhibited by bromide at the transcriptional level. In contrast, bromide has no obvious effect on transcription of rdc4, as no difference was detected between the sample with 50 mM NaBr and the control, both giving rise to the corresponding rdc4 PCR product (Fig. 3b). This result is consistent with the production of the epoxide-containing monocillins III (3) and V (5). Therefore, it is concluded that only the halogenase in the radicicol biosynthetic pathway is specifically inhibited by Br-. Effect of bromide on Rdc2 expression in E. coli We also examined whether expression of intron-free rdc2 in E. coli is influenced by bromide at 50 mM. Both soluble and insoluble proteins in E. coli were Fig. 2 HPLC profiles of methanol extracts of P. chlamydos-poria ATCC 16683 grown on blank PDA medium and PDA supplemented with NaF, NaCl, NaBr, or NaI at two different 5 and 50 mM. The 7-day old cultures were minced and extracted with methanol. The extracts were analyzed and quantified by HPLC at 280 nm. Peak 1 is radicicol, and the new peaks 2\u20135 were identified based on spectral data as monocillins II\u2013V, respectively. The HPLC traces shown are representative of three independent experiments 336 Biotechnol Lett (2011) 33:333\u2013338 123 analyzed and compared to the control by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Although the expression level of Rdc2 in E. coli is relatively low, it was clear that NaBr has no effect on the expression of rdc2 in pET28a under a T7 promoter in E. coli BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL strain. This indicated that, unlike in P. chlamydos-poria, bromide does not interfere with transcription of rdc2 in E. coli, likely due to the totally different systems in the fungus and bacterium. This also suggested a specific regulatory protein in the radic-icol producing strain might be affected by Br-, which subsequently leads to the inhibition of transcription of rdc2. Investigation of the specific target of Br-is currently underway. In summary, we have tested the effect of four halides on radicicol biosynthesis in P. chlamydospo-ria ATCC 16683. Bromide inhibits the formation of 1 by specifically targeting the dedicated halogenase Rdc2. RT\u2013PCR analysis indicated that the expression of rdc2 in P. chlamydosporia is inhibited by bromide at the transcriptional level. This work thus provides new insight into the effects of halides on secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi.

Total RNA was extracted from the ground mycelia using a RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA), which was subsequently used as the template to synthesize the cDNA using a SuperScript III First-Strand cDNA Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Specific primers includ-ing rdc2-50-NdeI (AACATATGTCGGTACCCAAGT CTTG) and rdc2-30-HindIII (AAAAGCTTTCAAACT TTGTTGAGGCCAA) were used to clone the rdc2 gene. Similarly, rdc4-50-NdeI (AACATATGAATG TATCGCCTCAGTT) and rdc4-30-EcoRI (AAGAA TTCTCAATCTGCTCTCTCATGCT) were used for amplification of rdc4. Pure water and the genomic DNA were used in the PCR analysis as negative and positive controls, respectively. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) was used for cloning. The PCR program for ampli-fication of both genes included an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 98NoneC, a 20-cycle touchdown program (30 s denaturation at 98NoneC, 30 s annealing at temperatures reduced by -0.5NoneC/cycle from 75NoneC to 65NoneC, 70 s extension at 72NoneC), an additional 20-cycle regular program (30 s denaturation at 98NoneC, 30 s annealing at 65NoneC, 70 s extension at 72NoneC), and a 10-min final extension at 72NoneC.

        "Halides have significant effects on the production of ochratoxins in Aspergillus ochraceus (Stander et al. 2000). To test whether halides can influence radicicol biosynthesis, NaF, NaCl, NaBr or NaI were added into PDA cultures of P. chlamydosporia, at 5 and 50 mM. None of the halides inhibited growth but the yield of 1 was significantly inhibited by NaBr (Table 1). HPLC of the products is shown in Fig. 2 showing the production of four new metabolites, 2\u20135. The same inhibition was observed with KBr, indi-cating that it is Br-that plays a key role in the inhibition of radicicol biosynthesis.",
        "We next identified what new metabolites were synthesized when radicicol biosynthesis was inhib-ited. ESI\u2013MS data revealed that molecular weights of 2\u20135 were 316, 332, 318, and 334, respectively. None of these compounds showed the characteristic ion",

Based on the corresponding UV and MS spectra, 2\u20135 were predicted to be monocillins II\u2013V (Fig. 1a) (Shinonaga et al. 2009; Wijeratne et al. 2004), which have been previously isolated from various fungi (Ayer et al. 1980; Shinonaga et al. 2009; Wijeratne et al. 2004).",
        "We also scaled up the culture and isolated 4 for complete NMR analysis. The low field carbon signals including the C-10 keto group, C-18 lactone group, 6 aromatic carbons, and two olefinic carbons, were present in the 13C NMR spectrum, while no epoxide signals were observed. In the 1H NMR spectrum, two meta-coupled aromatic protons (H-13 and H-15, J = 2.4 Hz) were present at d 6.26 and 6.15, respectively, confirming the absence of Cl in the molecule. Based on the 1H-1H COSY and HMBC spectra, the double bond can be located between C-4 and C-5 and thus 4 was characterized as monocillin IV. All the carbon and proton signals were assigned (Supplementary Table 1), which were in agreement with those previously reported (Shinonaga et al. 2009). Simi-larly, 2, 3 and 5 were confirmed to be monocillins II, III and V (Fig. 1a), respectively, by comparison of the NMR data with the literature (Shinonaga et al. 2009; Wijeratne et al. 2004).",
        "Because of the inhibition of radicicol biosynthesis and simultaneous production of four chlorine-lacking metabolites 2\u20135, it can be concluded that the dedicated halogenase Rdc2 has been inhibited by NaBr. Similar to this discovery, a previous study also reported that large amounts of bromide (100 mM CaBr2) can alter the secondary metabolism of another fungus, Lachnum papyraceum, to generate a different major metabolite papyracillic acid, although the mechanism still remains unknown (Shan et al. 1996).",
        "Effect of bromide on Rdc2 expression in P. chlamydosporia",
        "Inhibition of Rdc2 in P. chlamydosporia by bromide can be a result of regulation of enzyme activity or protein synthesis. In vitro enzymatic studies have shown that Br-can be used as a halogen donor by Rdc2 and has no effect on the enzymatic activity (Zeng and Zhan 2010). Thus, the possibility of activity inhibition can be ruled out and protein synthesis of Rdc2 in P. chlamydosporia must be inhibited by bromide. Protein synthesis can be regulated at the transcriptional or translational level. To find out whether transcription of rdc2 is affected by bromide, we used RT-PCR to analyze mRNA synthesis of rdc2 by P. chlamydosporia. The results (Fig. 3a) showed that no mRNA transcript of rdc2 was synthesized in the presence of 50 mM NaBr, thus confirming that expression of rdc2 was inhibited by bromide at the transcriptional level. In contrast, bromide has no obvious effect on transcription of rdc4, as no difference was detected between the sample with 50 mM NaBr and the control, both giving rise to the corresponding rdc4 PCR product (Fig. 3b). This result is consistent with the production of the epoxide-containing monocillins III (3) and V (5). Therefore, it is concluded that only the halogenase in the radicicol biosynthetic pathway is specifically inhibited by Br-.",

        "analyzed and compared to the control by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Although the expression level of Rdc2 in E. coli is relatively low, it was clear that NaBr has no effect on the expression of rdc2 in pET28a under a T7 promoter in E. coli BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL strain. This indicated that, unlike in P. chlamydos-poria, bromide does not interfere with transcription of rdc2 in E. coli, likely due to the totally different systems in the fungus and bacterium. This also suggested a specific regulatory protein in the radic-icol producing strain might be affected by Br-, which subsequently leads to the inhibition of transcription of rdc2. Investigation of the specific target of Br-is currently underway.",
        "In summary, we have tested the effect of four halides on radicicol biosynthesis in P. chlamydospo-ria ATCC 16683. Bromide inhibits the formation of 1 by specifically targeting the dedicated halogenase Rdc2. RT\u2013PCR analysis indicated that the expression of rdc2 in P. chlamydosporia is inhibited by bromide at the transcriptional level. This work thus provides new insight into the effects of halides on secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi.",
