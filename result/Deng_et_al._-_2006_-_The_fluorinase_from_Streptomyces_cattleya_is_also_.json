Naismith, David O#Hagan,* David A. Robinson, and Jonathan B. Spencer Streptomyces cattleya is unusual in that it elaborates organo-fluorine metabolites and in particular secretes fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine as secondary metabolites when incu-bated in a medium supplemented with fluoride ions.[1, 2] The first committed step on the biosynthetic pathway to these fluorometabolites involves the enzymatic mediated synthesis of 5\u2019-fluoro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine (5\u2019-FDA) from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) and fluoride ions.[3\u20135] After depurination, 5\u2019-FDA is metabolized first to 5-fluoro-5-deoxyribose-1-phosphate (5\u2019-FRP)[6] and then to fluorocetaldehyde.[7] Fluo-roacetaldehyde is converted separately into fluoroacetate[8] and 4-fluorothreonine[9] (Scheme 1). The fluorination enzyme, which has been the subject of a recent structural study,[10] has been isolated and fully charac-terized, the gene has been cloned, and the enzyme has been overexpressed. A stereochemical study that involved (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H]-SAM has indicated that the CNoneF bond of 5\u2019-FDA replaces the CNoneS bond of SAM with an inversion of configuration.[11, 12] This observation, as well as a theoretical study[13] and structural analysis[10] all suggest an SN2 reaction mechanism for the fluorinase. Despite the high bond-disso-ciation energy of the CNoneF bond (the strongest bond in organic chemistry[14]), we herein report that the fluorinase operates in the reverse direction and that it utilizes a chloride ion. Incubation of 5\u2019-FDAwith l-(13C-methyl)methionine resulted in the formation of 13C-methyl-SAM, which was identified by HPLC\u2013ES-MS. A similar experiment with l-selenomethio-nine (l-Se-met) and 5\u2019-FDA resulted in a sixfold more-efficient reaction to generate l-Se-SAM, which was readily identified through the mass-spectrometry fragmentation [*] Dr. H.

Comparison with the Vmax values that were calculated at saturating kinetics (assays run in each direction) indicated that the equilibri-um lies in favor of 5\u2019-FDA by a factor of three (see Scheme 2). Efforts were made to replace the fluoride ion with a chloride ion as a substrate for the fluorinase by using standard assay protocols. Incubation with chloride ions in the presence of SAM has never resulted in the pro-duction of 5\u2019-chloro-5\u2019-deoxyadeno-sine (5\u2019-ClDA) (by HPLC). It now emerges, however, that the failure to detect 5\u2019-ClDA is due to the equilib-rium of the chloride reaction lying significantly in favor of substrates over products rather than an inherent inability of the fluorinase to activate the chloride ions towards nucleophilic attack. This was revealed in two separate coupled-enzyme assays that were designed to shift the equilibrium of the reaction towards the organochlorine product. The first of these involved an assay in which the fluorinase was coupled to an l-amino acid oxidase (Bothrops atrox venom; purchased from Sigma Chem. Co. Ltd.). Removal of l-methionine, the coproduct of halide substitution by enzymatic oxidation, inhibits the reverse reaction. This assay therefore generated 5\u2019-ClDA and allowed, for the first time, the detection of this product from SAM and chloride ions (see Scheme 3.) A related experiment involved a coupled fluorinase/ adenyl acid deaminase (Aspergillus sp.)[15] assay. In this reaction the resultant 5\u2019-ClDA was converted into 5\u2019-chloro-5\u2019-deoxyinosine (5\u2019-ClDI). The production of 5\u2019-ClDI was readily identified by HPLC\u2013ES-MS against a reference compound.[16] These experiments indicated that the fluorinase can process chloride ions in a manner similar to that of fluoride ions. A set of fluorinase/l-methionine oxidase coupled assay experiments that were conducted at high concentrations of SAM (1 mm) and halide ion (25 mm) indicated a rate preference for FNone over ClNone by a factor of 120. This preference was also demonstrated in a fluorinase-mediated trans-halogenation reaction as illustrated in Figure 1. Incubation of 5\u2019-ClDA with fluoride ion, l-seleno-there are some small differences owing to crystal packing. Only one subunit of the trimer is discussed. The difference electron density shows that the C5\u2019NoneCl bond adopts two orientations that locate the organochlorine atom in one of two positions. One conformer (shown in Figure 2) is similar to that observed for 5\u2019-FDA when bound ID14 EH2 beamline. The structure was solved by molecular replace-ment with the original FDAS structure and refined by using Refmac. The final R-factor was 19.0% with an R-free of 24.7%.
