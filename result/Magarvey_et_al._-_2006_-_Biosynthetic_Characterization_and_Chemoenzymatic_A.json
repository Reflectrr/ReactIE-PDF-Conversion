ABSTRACT The lichen cyanobacterial symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and its close relative Nostoc sp. GSV 224 are prolific producers of natural products, gen-erating None25 derivatives of the cryptophycin class of secondary metabolites. Cryp-tophycin 1, the prototypic member of the class, is a potent tubulin-depolymerizing agent, and several semisynthetic derivatives are being developed as anticancer therapeutics. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the cryptophycin metabolic pathway by stable-isotope labeling experiments and through cloning, sequencing, and annotating the cryptophycin biosynthetic gene cluster. A com-parative secondary metabolomic analysis based on polyketide (PK)/non-ribo-somal peptide gene clusters from the phylogenetically related, non-cryptophycin producing cycad symbiont, Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, was used to identify the cryptophycin biosynthetic genes that encompass None40 kb within the lichen symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 genome. The pathway encodes a collinear set of enzymes, including three modular PK synthases, two non-ribosomal peptide syn-thetase modules, and an integrated adenylation/ketoreductase didomain for elaboration of the leucic acid subunit. In addition, genes encoding key tailoring steps, including a FAD-dependent halogenase and CYP450 epoxidase, were iden-tified. The inherent flexibility of the cryptophycin biosynthetic enzymes was har-nessed to generate a suite of new analogues by altering the pool of PK starter units and selected amino acid extender groups. Characterization of the cryptophycin CYP450 enabled development of the first stereospecific synthesis of cryptophycin 2, through a tandem chemoenzymatic synthesis from the natural seco-cryptophycin 4 chain elongation intermediate. C ryptophycins are the largest class of peptolidesisolated from cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)to date (1). The lichen cyanobacterial symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and its close genetic relative Nostoc sp. GSV 224 produce these promising anticancer agents (1\u20135). Cryptophycin 1 (1), the major representa-tive of None25 naturally occurring analogues, consists of four units, including a phenyl-octenoic acid (unit A) and L-leucic acid (unit D) and two amino acids, 3-chloro-O-methyl-D-tyrosine (unit B) and methyl None-alanine (unit C), linked in a cyclic ABCD sequence (Table 1). All of the other naturally occurring cryptophycins are analogues that differ structurally from 1 by one or two units in the molecule (Table 1). The Nostoc-derived cryptophycins exhibit extensive variation, indicating the flexibility and versatility of the biosynthetic pathway (1\u20135) (Table 1). Natural cryptophycin variants of unit A differ in their oxy-genation state (e.g., alkene vs hydroxyl groups and epoxide vs styrene) and double bond configurations (trans vs cis). Unit B contains phenylalanine variants, unit C includes methyl None-alanine or None-alanine, and unit D involves None-hydroxy acid subunit diversity (Table 1). Another notable cryptophycin variation, which does not commonly stem from other polyketide (PK) and non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetic pathways, is macrocy-clic ring size (16-vs 14-membered peptolide rings) (see Table 1) (1, 3, 4). p-glycoprotein pumps and are active against multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines (6). These properties led to the advancement of cryptophycin 52 (LY355703), a syn-thetic analogue, to phase II clinical trials. In an initial study, dose-limiting toxicities of that analogue restricted its further advancement (8). However, in a subsequent phase II clinical trial performed on patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, the study concluded that the considerable rate of disease stabilization sug-gests that LY355703 might warrant further investigation (9). Moreover, another generation of 1 analogues has been synthesized that shield the reactive epoxide as a chlorohydrin or glycinate ester, resulting in improved solubility (10). Preclinical studies with the most promis-TABLE 1. Structural variation of cryptophycins isolated from Nostoc strainsa ing of these compounds show a dramatic increase in activity against a variety of tumors (10). Because of the lack of large scale fermentation methods for isolation of cryptophycins, total synthesis was required to obtain adequate supplies for clinical evaluation (11). Several effective synthetic approaches have been developed for cryptophycin 3, a natural desoxy analogue of 1. However, the most significant challenge has been the late-stage stereospecific instal-lation of the epoxide moiety across the unit A C7\u2013C8 double bond (Table 1), which is necessary due to the labile nature of this functionality. Initial efforts resulted in no better than a 3:1 mixture of 1 and the None-epoxide diastereomer that was difficult to separate (12). A more effective strategy to control epoxide stereochemistry was accomplished using Evans asymmetric aldol chem-istry (13). This problem was addressed in an alternative manner for the synthesis of cryptophycin 52, which employed Sharpless methodology to generate a C7\u2013C8 syn diol at the seco-cryptophycin stage and subsequent conversion to the None-epoxide (14, 15). More recently, we reported a convergent, chemoenzymatic synthesis of desoxy-deschloro-cryptophycin 1 by assembling a set of seco-cryptophycin chain elongation intermediates as the N-acetyl cysteamine (SNAC) ester and converting them to the corresponding cyclic depsipeptide using a cryptophycin (Crp) thioesterase (TE) mediated approach (16). Completion of the final step remained dependent on successful development of the predicted CYP450 derived from the native Crp biosynthetic system to install the None-epoxide functional group. Here we provide a complete analysis of the biosyn-thetic origin and assembly for the A\u2013D subunits com-prising the Crp pathway through use of stable isotope precursor-labeling studies and the cloning, sequencing, and biochemical characterization of the Crp metabolic system. A comparative secondary metabolomic analysis was performed to localize and identify the 40 kb crp mixed polyketide synthase (PKS)/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster. Annotation pro-vided a detailed view of the collinear metabolic system and revealed a number of unique enzymatic steps involved in subunit assembly, peptolide ring elaboration, and post-PKS/NRPS tailoring reac-tions. Precursor-directed biosynthesis using unnatural starter units afforded a suite of novel cryptophycins, providing direct evidence for the flexibility of the biosynthetic enzymes along the assem-bly line. Finally, we demonstrate that CrpE is the crypto-phycin CYP450 that provides an efficient in vitro method to generate the None-epoxide with complete regio-and ster-eochemical control. This enabled a novel chemoenzy-matic synthesis of cryptophycin 2 using a tandem mac-rocyclization/epoxidation reaction sequence with CrpD TE and CrpE. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Identification, Cloning, and Sequencing of the Cryptophycin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster: Comparative Cyanobiont Secondary Metabolome Analysis. The subunit structures (units A\u2013D) comprising 1 (Figure 1) suggest an assembly from carboxylic acid and amino acid precursors by a mixed PKS/NRPS system. Degener-ate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets are widely used to amplify and clone DNA fragments encod-ing segments of NRPS adenylation (A) (amino acid selecting) domains and ketosynthase (KS) (condensing enzyme) domains of type I PKSs (17, 18). Therefore, our initial strategy was to amplify A and KS domain DNA fragments and use the mixture of amplicons to detect cosmids containing PKS and NRPS genes from a Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 genomic library. In the case of Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789, an unusually large number of nonover-lapping clones containing both NRPS and PKS genes were isolated reflecting a highly complex secondary metabolome. Four nonoverlapping PKS and NRPS gene-containing cosmids were partially sequenced to reveal distinct metabolic systems, but none were consistent with a Crp pathway (data not shown). Interestingly, three of the four cosmid DNA sequences revealed high simi-larity to secondary metabolic gene clusters found within the sequenced genome of the cycad symbiont, Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 (data not shown) (19). Nostopeptolides are the only previously described secondary metabolites produced by N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 (20), but there are no reports of its ability to produce cryptophycins. A Crp-sensitive bioassay using Cryptococcus neoformans (2) as an indicator strain con-firmed the lack of Crp production by N. punctiforme O O O HN N H O O O O O Cl 1 2 3 1 2 (U-13C) PyruvateL-Phenylalanine 3 \u00d7 acetate and methyl from SAMUnit A L-Leucine or\u03b1-ketoisocaproic acid3-Amino-2(R)-methylpropionic acidor (2S,3R)-3-methylaspartic acidUnit C L-Tyrosine and methyl from SAM3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5\u20325 Unit D Unit B (U-13C) Acetate(U-13C) L-Phenylalanine13C-Methyl of methionineFigure 1.

(data not shown). Therefore, we considered that a bioin-formatics approach using A and KS domain sequences from N. punctiforme compared to A and KS domain sequences from Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 would identify PKS and NRPS pathways unique to this lichen symbiont. Of the Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 A domain sequences cloned and analyzed, only six were absent from N. punc-tiforme. One of the six DNA fragments contained within cosmid pNAM123 had a predicted aromatic amino acid specificity code (Asp235, Ala236, Ser239, Thr278, Ile299, Ala301, Gly322, Ile330) (21) and was selected as the candidate Crp pathway A domain for unit B. Sig-nificantly, PCR primers designed from the pNAM123 DNA insert (see Methods) generated an amplicon from Nostoc sp. GSV 224 genomic DNA whose sequence was 98% identical to the pNAM123 insert (data not shown). As further evidence that the Crp biosynthetic gene clus-ters from Nostoc sp. GSV 224 and Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 are virtually identical, a fosmid was cloned from Nostoc sp. GSV 224 that partially contained crpD and encompassed all of the downstream genes associated with Crp production. The overlapping DNA sequences from Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and Nostoc sp. GSV 224 were None99.9% identical and contained crpE, crpF, crpG, and crpH in the same order (Figure 2). Interestingly, the DNA sequences from both species were essentially identical up to the transposase region, after which they diverged completely, suggesting that the crp gene clus-ters were integrated at different genomic loci within the two species. These data also provide evidence that crpH represents the terminus of the Crp biosynthetic gene cluster. Probing a Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 cosmid library provided pDHS500, whose insert was sequenced and found to contain NRPS and PKS genes consistent with the predicted architecture for the 3=-half of the Crp pathway. Additional library probing using PCR-based screening provided pDHS501 that overlapped with pDHS500 and contained the complete upstream PKS gene portion of the putative crp cluster. The crp gene cluster (40,304 bp) is flanked by trans-posases and inverted repeats (interestingly, the curacin A and jamaicamide cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (18, 22) are also flanked by transposases) that appear to represent the limits of the metabolic system (Figure 2). The first open reading frame (ORF) within crp is a type I PKS gene (8823 bp) that is followed by a second modular PKS gene (10,407 bp) and then two modular NRPS genes (5829 and 10,029 bp) designated crpA-D. A series of ORFs (crpE-H) downstream of the Crp PKS and NRPS genes are predicted to encode enzymes that catalyze functional group modifications (e.g., epoxi-dation (crpE) and chlorination (crpH)) present in 1 and many of its analogues. The crp biosynthetic gene cluster architecture (Figure 2) and a summary of each deduced protein sequence and corresponding functional role are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Proposed Assembly of the Cryptophycins. Biosyn-thesis of Type I PKS-Unit A: None-Hydroxy-phenyloctenoic Acid. As a first step toward unraveling the biosynthetic origin of unit A in the cryptophycins, sodium [1,2-13C2]acetate was provided in precursor incorporation studies to Nostoc sp. GSV 224 (Figure 1 and Supplemen-tary Experiment A). In this experiment the precursor was diluted with unlabeled acetate to minimize the forma-tion of interconnected [1,2-13C2]acetate units. The 1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of labeled 1 (Figure 1) appeared as a 1:0.64:1.2 cluster of peaks (1.8%) for the signals of six contiguous carbons in unit A, specifically C1 to C6, which was consistent with the incorporation of three intact acetate units. Each triplet was composed of a singlet for the natural abundance 13C flanked by peaks of a doublet for the incorporated 13C. The level of 13C enrichment (integration of doublet/integration of singlet) averaged 1.1%. The coupling constants associ-ated with the doublets rigorously established that the three intact acetate units had been assimilated into C1\u2013C2, C3\u2013C4, and C5\u2013C6. No 13C enrichment was observed in any of the other carbon signals for unit A. Similar results were obtained when sodium [U-13C3]pyru-vate was provided as a precursor to the cyanobacterium. To determine the fate of the acetate protons in the for-mation of the C1\u2013C2\u2013C3\u2013C4\u2013C5\u2013C6 segment of unit A, sodium [2-13C,2H3]acetate was provided as a precursor to the bacterial cells (Supplementary Experiment B). The 2H-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of the labeled 1 exhib-ited enhanced signals (1.8%) for C2 and C6 and isotopi-cally shifted 13C signals for C4. The C4 signals were found in a 1:0.6:1.2 triplet at 36.70, 36.35, and 36.02 ppm assigned to undeuterated, monodeuterated, and dideuterated C4, respectively. About 80% of the deute-rium on the 13C incorporated into C4 had been retained, whereas all of the deuterium on the 13C incorporated into C2 and C6 had been lost. To establish the origin of oxygen atoms attached to C1 and C5 in unit A, sodium [1-13C,18O2]acetate was provided to a culture of Nostoc sp. GSV 224 (Supple-ARTICLE www.acschemicalbiology.org VOL.1 NO.12 \u2022 766\u2013779 \u2022 2006 769 mentary Experiment C). The 13C NMR spectrum of the labeled 1 showed 13C peaks (1.3% enrichment) for C1 and C5 that were isotopically shifted upfield from the natural abundance lines by 0.03 and 0.04 ppm, respec-tively. This result revealed that essentially all of the 18O on the 13C incorporated into C1 and C5 from this precur-sor had been retained. A precursor incorporation experiment with L-[methyl-13C]methionine established that the methyl group on C6 of unit A originates from the C1 pool (Figure 1 and Supplementary Experiment D). The 13C NMR spectrum showed a substantial enhancement (15%) of the carbon signal at None 13.5. The origin of the remaining carbons in unit A (i.e., C7, C8, and those in the phenyl group) were shown to be phenylalanine-derived from a precursor incorporation experiment with L-[U-13C9-15N]phenylalanine (Supple-mentary Experiment E). The precursor was provided to Nostoc sp. GSV 224, and the bacterial culture was har-vested and processed for 1. The proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of 1 exhibited doublet and double doublet resonances (2.3% enrichment from the precur-sor) for C7 and C8, re-spectively, due to 13C enrichment from the precursor, with the natural abundance 13C superimposed at the center of the carbon signal (other carbons appeared as multiplets). The direct 2H NMR analysis of 1 obtained following supplementation of the cultures with L [2H8]phenylalanine showed poor but positive incorpora-tion of the precursor as indicated by weak deuterium signals for the phenyl group (Supplementary Experiment F). No sig-nificant level of deu-terium on the ben-zylic epoxymethine carbon, however, was detected. On the basis of these precursor incorporation results, phenylacetyl-CoA is a potential starter unit for the biosynthesis of unit A in 1 with chain elongation proceeding by a sequential addi-tion of three malonate units (Figure 1 and Figure 3, panel a). However, feeding experiments with labeled phenylacetic acid and the corresponding N-acetylcyste-amine thioester failed to show incorporation. Although it might not be possible for these precursors to be trans-ported across the cyanobacterial cell membrane, it is con-ceivable that another starter unit is involved (see below). Recently, the origin of the starter unit of the cyano-bacterial toxin microcystin (Mcy) was investigated by testing in vitro the activation and acylation of a series of candidate aryl and amino acids by McyG loading module (23). Acceptable substrates for the A loading domain were phenylpropanoids with McyG showing the highest selectivity toward trans-cinnamic acid. Interest-ingly, the CrpA A domain amino acid specificity code is identical to the corresponding McyG A domain, and thus, it is possible that trans-cinnamic acid functions as the Crp starter unit since it is also derived from phenyl-KS1 AT1 CM DH1 KR1 KS2 AT2 KR2 KS3 AT3 DH2 KR3 C1 A2 OM C2E A3 KR4 TE S S S SS O O O OH O OH NH O O HO MeO HN NH O O O HO O NH HN O O O O OH MeO OMe O HN O N H OO O O OMe O Cl Tailoring enzymesCryptophycin 1 CrpA CrpB CrpC CrpD pDHS 50135428 bppDHS 50033260 bp5 kb57306 bpA4A1 Module 1Loading domain Module 2Module 3Module 4Module 5Module 6S S crpA crpB crpC crpDorf8\u2032 orf7\u2032 orf6\u2032 orf5\u2032 orf4\u2032 orf3\u2032 orf2\u2032 orf1\u2032 orf6 orf5 orf4 orf3 orf2 orf1 crpH crpG crpF crpE ACP4ACP1 ACP2 ACP3 PCP1 PCP2 PCP3C3 Figure 2. The Crp gene cluster and the deduced PKS/NRPS assembly line. Block arrows indicate ORFs. Genes that are alanine (Figure 3, panel b). A remaining mystery is the mechanistic basis for an unprecedented one-carbon truncation within the growing unit A PK chain derived from a phenylpropanoid starter unit. The precursor incorporation studies described above are consistent with the established three-module domain organization of CrpA (A-ACP-KS-AT-DH-CM-KR-ACP) and CrpB (KS-AT-KR-ACP-KS-AT-DH-KR-ACP) that are collinear with the 1 unit A structure (Figure 2). Several structural variations that deviate from the col-linearity rule in the CrpA/B PKS are noteworthy. One is the smaller macrocycle (14-membered ring) found in cryptophycin 26 (Table 1), which is unique compared to all other cryptophycins. Formation of cryptophycin 26 requires that the C3 hydroxyl group serves as the nu-cleophile for CrpD TE mediated ring closure (16). By-passing of the CrpB dehydratase (DH) might preserve the C3 hydroxyl group in cryptophycin 26 as well as cryp-tophycin 30 (Table 1). In another natural analogue (cryp-tophycin 327) a C-2/C-3 cis-double bond occurs instead of the C-2/C-3 trans-double bond common to all other cryptophycins. The CrpB KR2 domain is predicted to be responsible for C3 ketoreduction, and its amino acid sequence is coincident with an S-specific KR (or type B) based on bioinformatics analysis (24\u201326) (Figure 3, panel c), consistent with the C-2/C-3 double bond. Pre-sumably the CrpB KR2 domain also generates an R C-3 stereoisomer at a low level, with the CrpB DH2 catalyzing dehydration to the C-2/C-3 cis olefin. NRPS: Incorporation of Unit B and Unit C in the Cryptophycins. Unit B: 3-Chloro-O-methyl-D-tyrosine. Unit C: Methyl-None-alanine. Unit B of 1 is 3-chloro-O-methyl-D-tyrosine, but other rare cryptophycins incorpo-rate L-amino acids (e.g., L-tyrosine), dichlorotyrosines (e.g., 3,5-dichloro-O-methyl-D-tyrosine), or desmethyl-deschlorotyrosines (e.g., O-methyl-D-tyrosine, D-tyrosine) (Table 1). The origin of unit B in 1 was explored using L-[1-13C]tyrosine and D-and L-3-([4-O-C2H3]-phenyl)-alanine precursor incorporation studies (Supplementary Experiments G and H, respectively). The 13C NMR spectrum from 1 produced in the presence of L-[1-13C]tyro-sine showed a 4% enhancement of C-1 of unit B. Feeding experiments with D-and L-3-([4-O-CH3]-phenyl)-alanine resulted in deuterium-enriched 1, indicating that unit B is derived from L-tyrosine, and the Crp NRPS catalyzes the incorporation of O-methyl-D-and -L-tyrosine (i.e., L-3-([4-O-CH3]phenyl)-alanine) (Figure 1). CrpC is a monomodular NRPS containing an elonga-tion module with an A domain that has an NRPS amino acid specificity code (Figure 3, panel a) most similar (75% identical, 87% similar) to the ApdB-M4 NRPS A domain (O-methyl-L-tyrosine, or N,O-dimethyl chloro-L-tyrosine). The CrpC A domain, bears an S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase between motifs A8 and A9 (27) of the polypeptide (Figure 2). Protein database searching revealed that the most similar peptide sequence (64% identity, 84% simi-larity) to the CrpC methyltransferase domain (None400 amino acids) is the ApdB-M3 methyltransferase of the a b c d 235 V V D G V V V McyG CrpA CrpC CrpD-M1 Ebony CrpD-M2 CesA-M1 236 G G A D D A G 239 V V S A A I V 278 W W T V V F W 299 V V I F V L V 301 A A A S S G G 322 A A G L F S T 330 S S I A G S S 331 G G G D D G G 517 K K K K K K K Type A (consensus)CrpB-KR3 (type B)CrpD-KR4 Type B (consensus)H H H H A M A A G G I I L I L D Q D D E D G T --------F F F F S S C S S S S S M V A N S G I F W L F G G S G P T P G N Q V G A N A N Y Y Y N-Mt CrpC OMetApdB-M3Met V V V L V V (D E E E )x I I G G G x T T G G G x K K G D D N G D E V V L F L S E E x D D Y L L R D N Y F F x S N VExSxARQxGxLD Not presentNot presentM3M2M1 A K E V L Y Methyl CrpA CrpB Malonyl CoAMalonyl CoAAT1 AT1 AT2 V Y Y Y Y V T T T T Q Q Q Q Q x V V V x x A A A x x L L L x x F F F x x A A A x x I I I x M E E E E x Y Y Y x S A A A A L L L L L A Y Y Y x x K K K x x L L L x G G G G G H H H H H S S S S S Q A V A V G G G G G Figure 3. Sequence alignments between key conserved amino acid motifs Apd NRPS (28). We propose the CrpC and ApdB-M3 methyltransferases (O-methylation of tyrosine) are a new type of NRPS domain that specify O-methylation, which is supported by unique amino acid sequence motifs (Figure 3, panel d). Both the ApbB-M3 and CrpC methyltransferase domains lack a core N-methyltrans-ferase amino acid sequence motif (M3), and residues within core methyltransferase motifs M1 and M2 are dif-ferent. Following the presumed OMet domain are A domain motifs (A9 and A10) of unknown function, a PCP domain, and an epimerase (E) domain (27) that is pre-dicted to catalyze the conversion of L-tyrosine to D-tyrosine. Unit B is structurally modified by mono-or dichlorination of the tyrosine subunit (Table 1). It remains to be determined whether halogenation occurs at the subunit stage to generate a precursor pool of chlo-rotyrosine or during a later stage of natural product assembly. CrpH, whose gene (crpH) represents the presumed terminus of the crp gene cluster is the predicted haloge-nase responsible for modification of tyrosine at the posi-tion ortho to the OMet moiety (Supplementary Table 1). Database comparisons with the deduced CrpH peptide sequence revealed that it resembles a number of previ-ously described non-heme flavin-dependent haloge-nases, including those from the rebeccamycin (29) and pyoluteorin (30) pathways. We expect that CrpH is responsible for mono-and dichlorination of the aromatic ring of unit B for the various Crp natural products. Unit C of 1 is methyl-None-alanine, whereas in a small number of analogues (e.g., cryptophycins 18, 24, 29, 176, 326; Table 1) None-alanine is incorporated for the elongation step. In primary metabolism, phosphopan-thetheine formation requires None-alanine that is in turn derived from aspartate via a PanD decarboxylase (31). To determine if methyl None-alanine is formed from methyl-aspartate (MASP), a MASP synthesis (32) was devel-oped using [13C]iodomethane instead of iodomethane to provide a 1:1 (SR/SS) diastereomeric mixture of the compounds (Supplementary Experiment I). This enabled precursor incorporation studies using a 13C-labeled methyl group in cultures of Nostoc sp. GSV 224. A 1.4% enrich-ment of 13C label from [methyl-13C]-(2S,3R/S)-3-MASP in the methyl group of unit C in 1 demonstrated that unit C is derived from this biosynthetic subunit (Figure 1). In ad-dition, feeding studies using [U-13C]pyruvate resulted in intact incorporation of pyruvate into the methyl-None-alanine unit (Figure 1 and Supplementary Experiment J). The only other natural product that is known to contain methyl-None-alanine is vicenistatin. However, a combina-tion of feeding studies and analysis of the DNA se-quence of the entire vicenistatin biosynthetic cluster (33) indicates a unique origin for this subunit. Spe-cifically, the methyl-None-alanine unit is presumably de-rived from glutamate that is rearranged by a glutamate mutase to form MASP and finally decarboxylated by a pyridoxal-5=-phosphate-dependent decarboxylase (33, 34). Intact incorporation of pyruvate by the Crp biosyn-thetic pathway is inconsistent with the formation of MASP derived by rearrangement from glutamic acid and suggests that MASP in Nostoc may originate from a biosynthetic pathway analogous to branched chain amino acid biosynthesis. The primary sequence of CrpG is similar to various PanD enzymes (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, when 13C-labeled S-methyl-None-alanine was fed to cultures of Nostoc sp. GSV 224, it was incorporated with a percent yield comparable to the incorporation of the R-isomer (Supplementary precursor-directed biosynthesis). It appears that the CrpD A2 domain does not discriminate between these diastereo-meric forms of the subunit. This result suggests that CrpG displays high selectivity toward R-MASP to afford the 2R-stereoisomer of methyl-None-alanine. The ability of the CrpD-M1 A domain to activate methyl-None-alanine/None-alanine is predicted based on its sequence similarity to previously characterized (21) None-alanine A domains (Figure 3, panel b). Mosaic NRPS/PKS Module. Unit D: Variation and Incorporation of Branch Chain None-Hydroxy Acids. On the basis of reasonable biosynthetic principles, it was evident that unit D of 1 is derived from None-hydroxyiso-caproic acid. Interestingly, None-hydroxyisovaleric acid, None-hydroxyisobutyric acid, or None-hydroxyvaleric acid is also incorporated based on the structures of several natural Crp analogues (Table 1; cryptophycins 19, 21, 49, 50, 54, 326). We sought to determine if L-leucine is the direct precursor for unit D by conducting precursor in-corporation experiments with DL-[5-2H3]leucine (Sup-plementary Experiment K) and with L-[1-13C]leucine (Figure 1, Supplementary Experiment L). In feeding experiments with DL-[5-2H3]leucine, 1 was isolated and shown to have a 2H resonance at 0.827 ppm (1.8% incorporation). Intact and equal incorporation (0.5%) of the methyl side chains derived from leucine into the unit D methyl groups was evident in the 13C NMR spec-trum of 1 isolated from these Nostoc cultures. In feed-772 VOL.1 NO.12 \u2022 766\u2013779 \u2022 2006 www.acschemicalbiology.orgMAGARVEY ET AL. ing studies with L-[1-13C]leucine, the 13C NMR spectrum showed incorporation of 1% of the label from C-1 of the precursor into C-1 of unit D. Precursor incorporation studies with None-hydroxyisocaproic acid, however, did not result in labeled cryptophycins (Supplementary Experiment M). Unlike None-hydroxyisocaproic acid, None-ketoisocaproate is a common leucine biosynthesis intermediate (35), formed from leucine via transamina-tion. The direct contribution of None-ketoisocaproate to unit D was tested by precursor incorporation studies with None-[1-13C]ketoisocaproic acid. 1 extracted from the result-ing cultures was subjected to 13C NMR analysis that showed enhancement (0.9%) of the ester carbonyl (Figure 1; Supplementary Experiment N). On the basis of the required conversion of leucine to the correspond-ing None-keto acid, we surmise that CrpF, a putative non-heme oxygenase (Supplementary Table 1), might catalyze oxidative deamination of leucine yielding None-ketoisocaproate. Final KR-mediated reduction (see below) would be required to generate the nascent unit D precursor. The final module within the Crp PKS/NRPS is the second module of CrpD (CrpD-M6) that bears an NRPS-like elongation module (C3-A4-KR4-PCP3) and the termi-nal TE domain, CrpD TE (16) (Figure 2). Following pre-sumed activation and transfer of None-ketoisocaproic acid to the CrpD-M6 PCP3, the tethered None-keto acid might serve as a substrate for the upstream KR-like domain. In polyketide biosynthesis, KR domains have been demon-strated to reduce None-keto groups with no reported prece-dent for None-keto reducing KRs. The valinomycin (vlm) (36) and cereulide (ces) (37) NRPSs contain dehydrogenases similar to that found in CrpD. One of the ces dehydroge-nases was recently demonstrated to catalyze None-keto reduction of a thioester bound 2-keto isocaproyl-PCP substrate (38). NRPS C domains typically function as amide synthe-tases, but the domain placement and predicted sub-strate of the CrpD C3 domain suggest that it is an ester synthetase. Highly homologous domains from the vlm (36) and ces (37) NRPSs were also predicted to bear ester synthetase C domains. Recently the fumonisin-A PCP-C didomain was shown to catalyze this type of ester bond formation (39). Finally, the hydroxyl group of unit A and the leucic acid carboxyl group of unit D are linked to form a lactone, catalyzed by CrpD TE (16). Precursor-Directed Biosynthesis of Novel Cryptophycins. The unusually large number of natural product analogues generated by the Crp biosynthetic system suggests that it is comprised of flexible enzymes for depsipeptide assembly and tailoring. We sought to assess further the versatility of the Crp assembly line using precursor-directed biosynthesis. A series of amino acids and halogens were used in order to probe the flex-ibility of enzymes responsible for incorporation of units A, B, and C. We first targeted the aromatic groups of unit A as this is among the least varied in the natural cryptophycins (Table 2), yet synthetic chemical structural modification to the aromatic group can provide enhanced bioactivity (11). Our demonstration that phenylalanine is con-verted into a substrate for the CrpA A1 domain sug-gested that analogues of this amino acid might provide insight into CrpA initiation domain flexibility. As an initial experiment, we used p-methylphenylalanine for precur-sor incorporation, which led to the new metabolite cryp-tophycin 111 (Table 2 and Supplementary Information). Further experiments included a diverse set of phenylala-nine analogues, including those with larger p-alkyl chains (i.e., ethyl and alkyl hydroxyl) and more bulky ring systems (naphthyl and biphenyl), cyano-appended rings, and para-substituted halides (Cl, Br, F, and I) (Table 2). In each case, new cryptophycins were gener-ated with expected starter units, revealing that the Crp loading domain is remarkably flexible. Interestingly, many of these amino acids were also incorporated within unit B (Table 2). Moreover, this work demon-strates that the Crp PKS/NRPS is able to channel and process alternative substrates of varying structural com-plexity (Table 2). In most cases, the new compounds obtained were modified by the presumed CrpE CYP450, revealing significant tolerance of the epoxidase toward unnatural substrates (Table 2). The in vivo specificity of the CrpH halogenase was also investigated by adding CaBr2 and CaI2 to the cya-nobacterial culture medium. Surprisingly, both bromine and iodine were incorporated into unit B, indicating an additional opportunity for in vivo generation of diverse products (Table 2). This was particularly intriguing in view of recent reports that replacement of chlorine for iodine has not been observed previously in natural product halogenases (40). Interestingly, the epoxidized product of the brominated molecule (Table 2; cryptophy-cin 104) was extracted from the bacterial culture, but the ARTICLE www.acschemicalbiology.org VOL.1 NO.12 \u2022 766\u2013779 \u2022 2006 773 iodinated form (Table 2; cryptophycin 320) was also iso-lated as the trans-styrene, indicating that unit B might impose structural constraints on CrpE substrate selectivity. Flexibility of the Crp pathway unit C enzymes was investigated by evaluating precursor incorporation using None-alanine, and (2S)-3-aminoisobutyric acid. Both of these amino acids were incorporated into unit C with complete downstream processing to the expected cyclic depsipeptide structures (Table 2; cryptophycins 24, 29, 342, 343). Cryptophycin 52, the synthetic lead molecule that was advanced to clinical trials, is identical to 1 except for a gem-dimethyl None-alanine as unit C. On the basis of precursor incorporation studies showing that the CrpD A domain is tolerant of unnatural subunits, we sought to test whether the Crp biosynthetic machinery was capable of forming cryptophycin 52 in vivo. Direct supplementation of gem-dimethyl None-alanine to Nostoc cultures resulted in a product that was shown by NMR to TABLE 2. Summary of the precursor-directed biosynthesis to assess substrate tolerance in the Crp pathwaya be cryptophycin 52 (Table 2 and Supplementary Infor-mation for NMR characterization of cryptophycins). This is the first report using precursor-directed biosynthesis to produce cryptophycin 52, further advancing the potential of the Crp biosynthetic machinery to access important bioactive Crp analogues. Previous to this work, access to this important analogue was only pos-sible by total synthesis (41). Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Cryptophycin 2: Sequential Synthesis from Seco-cryptophycin 4 Using CrpD TE/CrpE P450. Recently, we reported the ability of excised CrpD TE to catalyze in vitro macrocyclization of several acyl-peptide SNAC variants of Crp chain-elon-gation intermediates (16). One of the depsipeptide products obtained from the TE was desoxycryptophycin 2, the presumed substrate for the Crp epoxidase. The desoxycryptophycins have significantly reduced bioac-tivity, and it is installation of the None-epoxide that repre-sents a significant challenge in Crp total synthesis. The Crp epoxidase was readily identified as the putative product of crpE whose deduced amino acid sequence is similar to numerous CYP450s involved in hydroxylation or epoxidation. To explore its specific function, the gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli to provide a soluble histidine tagged/maltose-binding protein variant (data not shown). Incubation of CrpE with cryptophycin 4 resulted in None75% conversion to a com-pound with a mass consistent with cryptophycin 2 (Figure 4). Scale-up provided sufficient quantities of the epoxidized material to confirm by 1H NMR that the com-pound is a single diastereomer (i.e., the None-epoxide) and identical in all respects to cryptophycin 2 (42). This result confirms that CrpE is the Crp epoxidase that enables efficient, stereospecific installation of a None-epoxide into the cryptophycins. As an additional dem-onstration of the flexibility of this system, we employed the seco-cryptophycin 4 intermediate in a tandem in situ reaction that included CrpD TE, CrpE, and all required cofactors (see Methods). This experimental system pro-vided direct isolation of cryptophycin 2 as a single product without the need to purify the desoxycryptophy-cin 2 intermediate (Figure 4). Effective in vitro reconstitu-tion of these two final biosynthetic steps promises immediate access to new cryptophycins in the search for improved anticancer lead compounds. In summary, the cyanobacterial symbiont-derived Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and the highly related Nostoc sp. GSV 224 produce the crytophycin natural products. These compounds have shown significant potential as anticancer therapeutic agents, and a number of ana-logues are currently being explored as clinical candi-dates. In this report, we focused on five allied studies, including (i) cloning, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis of the Crp gene cluster, (ii) precursor incorpora-tion studies to reveal the specific source of each biosyn-thetic subunit, (iii) precursor directed biosynthesis to probe the flexibility of Crp metabolic enzymes involved in chain assembly, cyclization, and tailoring, (iv) identifi-cation and functional analysis of the CrpE CYP450 that catalyzes None-epoxide formation to yield 1 and related analogues, and (v) tandem in vitro assembly of crypto-phycin 2 from seco-cryptophycin 4 using CrpD TE and CrpE reconstituted in a single reaction vessel. Because of the remarkable number of secondary meta-bolic gene clusters associated with Nostoc sp. genomes, a comparative analysis was employed to survey the com-plete secondary metabolome of N. punctiforme and use it as a tool to identify the crp gene cluster in both Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and Nostoc sp. GSV 224. To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural product gene cluster iden-tification using a comparative metabolomic strategy, made possible by the availability of a full genome sequence in a highly related species. Previous studies have shown the close phylogenetic relationship between lichen cyanobionts (43), but our reported strategy probes further the potential value of investigating cyanobiont phylogeny and secondary metabolism. A particularly significant characteristic of the Crp bio-synthetic system is its ability to generate None25 related natural products that include alterations in subunit structures, including units A, B, C, and D, depsipeptide ring size (14 vs 16), and variations in tailoring reactions, including epoxidation and halogenation. Subunit A structural variants are presumably derived from impre-cise PKS processing reactions, including Crp module 3 KR3 and DH2 domains. These events result in variant double bond configuration or presence of a second hydroxyl group at C-3 in unit A (Table 1). NRPS enzymes involved in assembly of units B, C, and D show flexibil-ity in amino acid and None-hydroxy acid subunit selectivity, resulting in the incorporation of diverse, yet related, extender groups. Tailoring reactions involving the crpE-encoded halogenase can result in one or two chlorine atoms in the unit B aromatic ring of tyrosine. Precursor incorporation studies revealed definitively the source of ARTICLE www.acschemicalbiology.org VOL.1 NO.12 \u2022 766\u2013779 \u2022 2006 775 units B, C, and D. Although unit A was shown to be derived from three acetate groups, the ultimate source of the \u201cphenylacetate\u201d starter group requires further investigation. Phenylalanine is the likely Crp pathway initiation group, but the precise steps involved in con-version to the \u201cphenylacetate\u201d equivalent remains unknown. Precursor-directed incorporation studies revealed additional flexibility for the Crp biosynthetic pathway through its ability to accept a number of struc-turally diverse starter units that were channeled, pro-cessed, cyclized, and released as fully elaborated novel depsipeptide natural products. Finally, we demon-strated for the first time a stereospecific epoxidation reaction resulting in effective conversion of cryptophycin 4 to cryptophycin 2 using the CrpE CYP450. This unique biocatalyst, along with the versatile CrpD TE domain, provides new, useful tools for the chemoenzymatic syn-thesis of Crp anticancer agents. METHODS General Microbiology and Molecular Biology Procedures: Chemicals, Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and DNA Subcloning. Molecular biology reagents and enzymes were sup-plied by New England Biolabs except for Pfu (Stratagene), dNTPs (Takara), T4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen), pSMART-HCKan (Lucigen), and Wizard SV PCR Clean-up kit (Promega). When necessary, other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nostoc cul-tures were routinely maintained on BG-11 agar plates prepared as previously described (44). Nostoc strains prepared for genomic DNA extraction and production of Crp were grown in BG-11 medium (44) at 28 \u00b0C with constant illumination (9 W m\u20132) and aeration. The E. coli strains used for cloning and plasmid harvesting were XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) and TOP-10 (Invitrogen). Protein overexpression was performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen). All E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and when necessary supplemented with 25 Noneg mLNone1 kanamycin. Preparation and manipulation of plasmid DNA from E. coli were accomplished using standard methods (45). DNA sequencing was performed at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core or the University of Minnesota Advanced Genetic Analysis Center using ABI Prism sequencers and the dye termination method. Subtractive Analysis of Nostoc A and KS Domains. Amplicons encoding both KS domain (None750 bp) and A domain fragments (None1100 bp) were obtained using conditions and PCR primers described previously (46, 47). The resulting amplicons were cloned into the sequencing vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and 96 clones bearing inserts for both KS and A domains were selected for DNA sequencing. Sequences of KS and A domains were com-pared by multiple sequence alignment using the Clustal X program (48) (version 1.82) with A and KS domains from the deduced sequence of NRPSs and PKSs encoded by ORFs identi-fied within the N. punctiforme genome sequence (GenBank accession # NZ_AAAY00000000). Cloning, Sequencing, and Annotating the Crp Cluster. High molecular weight genomic DNA was harvested from Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and Nostoc sp. GSV 224 according to established protocols (49) and also using a FASTDNA spin kit (Qbiogene). For cosmid library construction total Nostoc DNA was partially digested using Sau3AI, dephosphorylated, and size selected (36\u201340 kb) using a CHEF gel with a CHEF-DR III PFGE system (Biorad), followed by ligation into BamHI-digested SuperCos1 (Stratagene). The ligation mixture was packaged using the Giga-pack III XL Packaging Extract Kit (Stratagene), and the resulting library was titered and amplified according to manufacturer instructions. Fosmid libraries were constructed in an analogous fashion but without prior restriction enzyme digestion, and blunt-ended fragments were cloned directly into pCC1Fos fosmid according to manufacturer instructions (Epicentre). The insert within pNAM123 (encoding a portion of an A domain) was liber-ated by EcoRI digestion, and the resulting DNA fragment was radiolabeled using the RadPrime labeling kit (Pharmacia) with [None-32P] dCTP (Amersham) according to manufacturer directions. The radiolabeled fragments were used to probe the genomic library using standard colony hybridization protocols (45). The cosmid pDHS500, identified from probing with the pNAM123 insert, was fully sequenced using a shot-gun cloning approach where pDHS500 was fragmented in a nebulizer (IPT Medical Products, Inc.) with the following parameters, 4.4 None 104 Pa of N2 for 4.0 min. Likewise, the fosmid DNA from pDHS501 was nebulized and the 2\u20136 kb fragments collected. The resulting pDHS500 and 501 fragments were blunt-ended by Klenow and T7 DNA polymerase and phosphorylated by treatment with T4 kinase and ATP immediately prior to fractionation on a low melting agarose gel. Fragments in the 2\u20136 kb size range were eluted, concentrated, and used separately for ligation into Cryptophycin 2 Cryptophycin 4 (ii) Seco-cryptophycin 4 (iii) (i) 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 Time (min)A bs or ba nc e (2 18  nm ) a b TE CrpE TE CrpE O O HN N H O O O OMeO Cryptophycin 4 OH H N O N H O O O S O N H O OMe O O HN N H O O O OMeO O Cryptophycin 2Seco-cryptophycin 4(ii) (iii) (iv) + (iv) Figure 4. CrpD TE mediated cyclization and CrpE mediated epoxidation. a) Illustration of the reactions catalyzed by CrpD TE and CrpE. b) HPLC traces the SmaI site of pUC18 and pSMART-HCKan (Lucigen). The sequences of pUC18 and pSMART-HCKan inserts were trimmed to remove sequences of SuperCos-1 and pCC1Fos and assem-bled into contigs using the SeqMan 5.06 program of the DNASTAR software package. The pDHS501 fosmid was identi-fied by a PCR-screening strategy employing primers designed from the crpD TE region (16) and a second set (5=-GCATTGTC-ATTTCTGGTGAGGC-3= and 5=-CCTGCTGCTAAGGCTATTTCCAAG-3=) for a portion of crpB contained within pDHS500. Two rounds of PCR were used to identify clones that produced amplicons using the PKS primers, but not the TE domain primers. The first round of PCR was used to identify plates that contained amplicons of the desired size. pDHS500 was used as a positive control for both primer sets. Ten-microliter portions of each culture from a given 96-well plate were pooled. The DNA was then used in PCR reactions using the TE and the PKS primer sets. The PCR re-actions contained 1 NoneL of pooled DNA, 1 NoneM of each primer, 200 NoneM dNTP, 5 NoneL of Taq polymerase buffer, and 0.5 NoneL of Taq DNA polymerase, and water was added to a final volume of 50 NoneL. The PCR reactions were run at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min and cycled 30 times with the program: 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. A crpB PKS amplicon was generated from one of the clones with the crpB primer set but not with the crpD TE primer set. The clone (pDHS501) producing this amplicon was identified and shown to extend from the 5= end of pDHS500. ORFs from pDHS500 and pDHS501 were identified using Vector NTI software package version 10 and their deduced amino acid sequences compared to others in the GenBank database. The domain arrangements of the Crp PKS and NRPS proteins were determined using the web-based software program PKS-NRPS (50). The PKS-NRPS program was also used to determine the pre-dicted specificity codes of the Crp NRPS A domains. The crp gene cluster DNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank under accession number EF159954. Overexpression and Purification of CrpE. The CrpE gene was amplified by PCR using cosmid pDHS500 as template. A typical 50 NoneL reaction mixture contained 5 ng of pDHS500, 2 NoneM forward primer (5=-TGC GGA TCC ATG ATT AAT ACT GCT AAA TCC-3=) and 2 NoneM reverse primer (5=-ACG CGA ATT CTT ACA ATA CAA CCA TTT TTA ATC C-3=) (BamHI and EcoRI sites are underlined), 200 NoneM dNTP, 5 NoneL of 10 None PCR buffer. Conditions for crpE amplifications included an initial 5 min denaturation step (94 \u00b0C) and cycling conditions of 94 \u00b0C (30 s), 58.5 \u00b0C (30 s), and 72 \u00b0C (1 min 45 s) for 35 cycles followed by a final 72 \u00b0C exten-sion step (7 min). The crpE amplicon was phosphorylated using T4 kinase and ligated into pSMART-HCKan to produce pDing1. The insert within pDing1 was sequenced and shown to be free of PCR errors. pDing1 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into linear pSJ8 (EcoRI/BamHI cut). The resulting plasmid, pDing2, and chaperone expressing plasmid pGRO7 were used to cotransform E. coli BL21(DE3) to ampicillin (amp) (50 Noneg mL\u20131) and chloramphenicol (chl) (25 Noneg mL mLNone1) resistance. A 5 mL overnight culture was diluted in 1 L of LB supplemented with amp (50 Noneg mL\u20131), chl (25 Noneg mLNone1), 0.25 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 mM thiamine, and 0.25 mM of 5-aminolevulinic acid that was added 30 min prior to induction (OD600 None 0.6). The culture was then cooled to 4 \u00b0C before induc-ing with 0.1 mM Isopropyl-None-D-thiogalactopyranoside and 1 g L mL\u20131 of L-arabinose. The culture was grown at 15 \u00b0C with con-stant shaking (200 rpm) for 20 h. The cells were pelleted by cen-trifugation and resuspended in 80 mL of PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 10 mM sodium hydrogen phosphate, and 1.8 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 7.4, 3 mM None-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). The cell suspen-sion was then sonicated and the lysate collected following cen-trifugation (40,000g for 45 min). The resulting supernatant was collected and incubated with pre-equilibrated amylase agarose resin at 4 \u00b0C for 3 h with agitation. The amylase agarose resin was washed (100 column volumes of lysis buffer) and MBP-His-CrpE eluted with lysis buffer containing 8 mM maltose. Maltose was removed from the protein sample with a PD-10 column, and the MBP-His-CrpE fusion protein was then treated with His-TEV protease at 4 \u00b0C overnight to remove the MBP-His portion. The CrpE protein was separated from the MBP-His polypeptide by passing the mixture through a Ni-agarose column. The concen-tration of the purified protein was determined by its predicted extinction coefficient (81,820 MNone1 cmNone1 at 280 nm). The active CrpE concentration was determined using previously described methods (51). Generation of Cryptophycin 4 Using the Cryptophycin TE. Syn-thesis of seco-SNAC-cryptophycin 4 and heterologous expres-sion and purification of the Crp TE (CrpD TE) were conducted fol-lowing published procedures (16). Seco-SNAC-cryptophycin 4 (2.4 mg) was dissolved to 2 mM in DMSO and then diluted to 100 NoneM in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.0. A 10 NoneM portion of CrpD TE was added to this mixture and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 15 h. The reac-tion was next extracted with ethyl acetate (3 None 25 mL), and the ethyl acetate fractions were pooled and concentrated. The total contents of the ethyl acetate extraction were separated by semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC (C18 Econosil, 10 None 250 mm, 5 mL min\u20131, 10\u2013100% acetonitrile/water, 50 min). The peak cor-responding to cryptophycin 4 was collected and lyophilized. HPLC tret 36.3 min; mass spectrometry (MS) (ESI\n) m/z 605.2, [M \n H] (C35H45N2O7 requires 605.3). CrpE Reactions and HPLC Analysis. CrpE reactions contained 100 Noneg mL\u20131 ferredoxin, 0.2 units mLNone1 of ferredoxin-NADP reductase, 1.4 mM of NADPH, 10 mM of glucose-6-phosphate, 8 units mL\u20131 of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5.2 NoneM seco-SNAC-cryptophycin 4, and 1.8 NoneM CrpD TE or 9 NoneM crypto-phycin 4 in 100 NoneL of lysis buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 2 min, and then 3 NoneM CrpE and/or 1.8 NoneM CrpD TE was added to initiate the reaction at 30 \u00b0C for 2\u20134 h. A control reaction was run in parallel that contained boiled CrpE in place of active CrpE. The reaction mixtures were then separated by analytical reversed-phase HPLC (C18 Econosil, 4.6 None 250 mm, 1 mL min\u20131, 30\u2013100% acetonitrile/water \n 0.1% TFA, 40 min, 218 nm). Reaction of CrpE with cryptophycin 4 yielded cryp-tophycin 2 as determined by LC/MS tret 25.3 min; MS (ESI\n) m/z 621.2, [M \n H] (C35H45N2O8 requires 621.3), and m/z 643.2, [M \n Na] (C35H44N2NaO8 requires 643.3). A large-scale reaction was performed using the same ratio of reagents but 100 None the volume. For this reaction, spinach ferredoxin reductase was purified from spinach leaves using modified protocols (52). Briefly, 3 kg of crude homogenate obtained from grinding in a Waring blender was fractionated with acetone according to a previously published method (53). The precipitate obtained was dissolved in 58 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and passed through three Hi-Trap Q 5 mL columns in series using an isocratic flow of 5 mL minNone1 in the same buffer. The yellow flow-through fractions were concentrated and used directly in the reaction. Purified epoxi-dized material was analyzed by NMR using a Varian INOVA 600 NMR spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm HCN probe. The Crp sample was dissolved in 200 NoneL of CD3OD. The NMR spectrum was identical to that reported for cryptophycin 2 with the chemi-cal shifts for the epoxide protons at 3.94 (dd, J \t 7.5, 1.8 Hz), 3.70 (d, J \t 1.8 Hz), and 1.80 (m) for the adjacent ring proton (42). General Chemical Procedures: Labeled Precursors, Stable-Isotope Feedings, and Directed Biosynthesis.

The methods for all of the feeding study experiments are contained within the Supporting Information section. In general, Nostoc sp. GSV 224 or Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 were cultured in 20-L glass carboys as previously described (3). All feeding studies were performed with both Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and Nostoc sp. GSV 224 with essentially identical results. The isotopically labeled or biosynthetic precursor was added to each of two 20-L cultures of Nostoc sp. GSV 224 or Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 begin-ning on day 10 after inoculation unless noted otherwise. For precursor-directed biosynthesis, an aqueous solution of the pre-cursor was added all at once or in aliquots (2\u20138) every other day. Usually an amino acid precursor was dissolved in 0.5 N HCl to a concentration of 10\u201330 mg mL\u20131 and fed in 8 aliquots. Typi-cally, a 0.5 mL portion of the solution was added to each of the 2\u20134 carboys of Nostoc sp. GSV 224 culture in 2-d intervals beginning on day 10\u201312 after inoculation. After 6\u201310 additions of the amino acid solution, the cultures were allowed to grow for an additional 3\u20135 d and then harvested. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained at 500 and 125 MHz in CDCl3. All 13C, 15N, 2H, and 18O-labeled compounds used in this study were 99, 96\u201399, 98, and 95 atom %, respectively, unless noted otherwise. Low-resolution MS was performed at the University of Michigan Mass Spectrometry Laboratory on a Waters Ultima magnetic sector mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface. Isolation of Labeled Cryptophycins. Lyophilized Nostoc sp. GSV 224 (10\u201330 g) was extracted with 4:1 mixture of CH3CN/CH2Cl2 (40 mL g\u20131) for 48 h and the extract concentrated in vacuo to give a dark green solid. This solid (1 g) was applied to an ODS-coated silica column (55 g, 15 None 2.5 cm) and subjected to flash chromatography with 1:3 CH3CN/H2O (0.4 L), 1:1 CH3CN/H2O (0.4 L), 65:35 CH3CN/H2O (0.8 L), CH3OH (0.4 L), and CH2Cl2 (0.4 L). The material was eluted with 65:35 CH3CN/H2O (100\u2013 400 mg) and further separated by reversed-phase HPLC (Econo-sil C18, 10 Nonem, 25 cm None 22 mm, UV detection at 254 nm, 65:35 CH3CN/H2O, flow rate 6 mL min \u20131) to give labeled cryptophycin 1 (t R 53.0 min) and a number of fractions containing mixtures of other labeled cryptophycins. The natural cryptophycins eluted between 25 and 100 min. Labeled analogues were isolated using previously described procedures (3). The isolation of deu-terated cryptophycins was monitored by 2H NMR spectroscopy.

        "ABSTRACT The lichen cyanobacterial symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and its close relative Nostoc sp. GSV 224 are prolific producers of natural products, gen-erating None25 derivatives of the cryptophycin class of secondary metabolites. Cryp-tophycin 1, the prototypic member of the class, is a potent tubulin-depolymerizing agent, and several semisynthetic derivatives are being developed as anticancer therapeutics. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the cryptophycin metabolic pathway by stable-isotope labeling experiments and through cloning, sequencing, and annotating the cryptophycin biosynthetic gene cluster. A com-parative secondary metabolomic analysis based on polyketide (PK)/non-ribo-somal peptide gene clusters from the phylogenetically related, non-cryptophycin producing cycad symbiont, Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, was used to identify the cryptophycin biosynthetic genes that encompass None40 kb within the lichen symbiont Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 genome. The pathway encodes a collinear set of enzymes, including three modular PK synthases, two non-ribosomal peptide syn-thetase modules, and an integrated adenylation/ketoreductase didomain for elaboration of the leucic acid subunit. In addition, genes encoding key tailoring steps, including a FAD-dependent halogenase and CYP450 epoxidase, were iden-tified. The inherent flexibility of the cryptophycin biosynthetic enzymes was har-nessed to generate a suite of new analogues by altering the pool of PK starter units and selected amino acid extender groups. Characterization of the cryptophycin CYP450 enabled development of the first stereospecific synthesis of cryptophycin 2, through a tandem chemoenzymatic synthesis from the natural seco-cryptophycin 4 chain elongation intermediate.",

        "Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and its close genetic relative Nostoc sp. GSV 224 produce these promising anticancer agents (1\u20135). Cryptophycin 1 (1), the major representa-tive of None25 naturally occurring analogues, consists of four units, including a phenyl-octenoic acid (unit A) and L-leucic acid (unit D) and two amino acids, 3-chloro-O-methyl-D-tyrosine (unit B) and methyl None-alanine (unit C), linked in a cyclic ABCD sequence (Table 1). All of the other naturally occurring cryptophycins are analogues that differ structurally from 1 by one or two units in the molecule (Table 1). The Nostoc-derived cryptophycins exhibit extensive variation, indicating the flexibility and versatility of the biosynthetic pathway (1\u20135) (Table 1). Natural cryptophycin variants of unit A differ in their oxy-genation state (e.g., alkene vs hydroxyl groups and epoxide vs styrene) and double bond configurations (trans vs cis). Unit B contains phenylalanine variants, unit C includes methyl None-alanine or None-alanine, and unit D involves None-hydroxy acid subunit diversity (Table 1). Another notable cryptophycin variation, which does not commonly stem from other polyketide (PK) and non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetic pathways, is macrocy-clic ring size (16-vs 14-membered peptolide rings) (see Table 1) (1, 3, 4).",
        "p-glycoprotein pumps and are active against multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines (6). These properties led to the advancement of cryptophycin 52 (LY355703), a syn-thetic analogue, to phase II clinical trials. In an initial study, dose-limiting toxicities of that analogue restricted its further advancement (8). However, in a subsequent phase II clinical trial performed on patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, the study concluded that the considerable rate of disease stabilization sug-gests that LY355703 might warrant further investigation (9). Moreover, another generation of 1 analogues has been synthesized that shield the reactive epoxide as a chlorohydrin or glycinate ester, resulting in improved solubility (10). Preclinical studies with the most promis-",

        "ing of these compounds show a dramatic increase in activity against a variety of tumors (10). Because of the lack of large scale fermentation methods for isolation of cryptophycins, total synthesis was required to obtain adequate supplies for clinical evaluation (11). Several effective synthetic approaches have been developed for cryptophycin 3, a natural desoxy analogue of 1. However, the most significant challenge has been the late-stage stereospecific instal-lation of the epoxide moiety across the unit A C7\u2013C8 double bond (Table 1), which is necessary due to the labile nature of this functionality. Initial efforts resulted in no better than a 3:1 mixture of 1 and the None-epoxide diastereomer that was difficult to separate (12). A more effective strategy to control epoxide stereochemistry was accomplished using Evans asymmetric aldol chem-istry (13). This problem was addressed in an alternative manner for the synthesis of cryptophycin 52, which employed Sharpless methodology to generate a C7\u2013C8 syn diol at the seco-cryptophycin stage and subsequent conversion to the None-epoxide (14, 15). More recently, we reported a convergent, chemoenzymatic synthesis of desoxy-deschloro-cryptophycin 1 by assembling a set of seco-cryptophycin chain elongation intermediates as the N-acetyl cysteamine (SNAC) ester and converting them to the corresponding cyclic depsipeptide using a cryptophycin (Crp) thioesterase (TE) mediated approach (16). Completion of the final step remained dependent on successful development of the predicted CYP450 derived from the native Crp biosynthetic system to install the None-epoxide functional group. Here we provide a complete analysis of the biosyn-thetic origin and assembly for the A\u2013D subunits com-prising the Crp pathway through use of stable isotope precursor-labeling studies and the cloning, sequencing, and biochemical characterization of the Crp metabolic system. A comparative secondary metabolomic analysis was performed to localize and identify the 40 kb crp mixed polyketide synthase (PKS)/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster. Annotation pro-vided a detailed view of the collinear metabolic system",
        "and revealed a number of unique enzymatic steps involved in subunit assembly, peptolide ring elaboration, and post-PKS/NRPS tailoring reac-tions. Precursor-directed biosynthesis using unnatural starter units afforded a suite of novel cryptophycins, providing direct evidence for the",
        "flexibility of the biosynthetic enzymes along the assem-bly line. Finally, we demonstrate that CrpE is the crypto-phycin CYP450 that provides an efficient in vitro method to generate the None-epoxide with complete regio-and ster-eochemical control. This enabled a novel chemoenzy-matic synthesis of cryptophycin 2 using a tandem mac-rocyclization/epoxidation reaction sequence with CrpD TE and CrpE.",
        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Identification, Cloning, and Sequencing of the Cryptophycin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster: Comparative Cyanobiont Secondary Metabolome Analysis. The subunit structures (units A\u2013D) comprising 1 (Figure 1) suggest an assembly from carboxylic acid and amino acid precursors by a mixed PKS/NRPS system. Degener-ate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets are widely used to amplify and clone DNA fragments encod-ing segments of NRPS adenylation (A) (amino acid selecting) domains and ketosynthase (KS) (condensing enzyme) domains of type I PKSs (17, 18). Therefore, our initial strategy was to amplify A and KS domain DNA fragments and use the mixture of amplicons to detect cosmids containing PKS and NRPS genes from a Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 genomic library. In the case of Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789, an unusually large number of nonover-lapping clones containing both NRPS and PKS genes were isolated reflecting a highly complex secondary metabolome. Four nonoverlapping PKS and NRPS gene-containing cosmids were partially sequenced to reveal distinct metabolic systems, but none were consistent with a Crp pathway (data not shown). Interestingly, three of the four cosmid DNA sequences revealed high simi-larity to secondary metabolic gene clusters found within the sequenced genome of the cycad symbiont, Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 (data not shown) (19). Nostopeptolides are the only previously described secondary metabolites produced by N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 (20), but there are no reports of its ability to produce cryptophycins. A Crp-sensitive bioassay using Cryptococcus neoformans (2) as an indicator strain con-firmed the lack of Crp production by N. punctiforme",

        "(data not shown). Therefore, we considered that a bioin-formatics approach using A and KS domain sequences from N. punctiforme compared to A and KS domain sequences from Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 would identify PKS and NRPS pathways unique to this lichen symbiont. Of the Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 A domain sequences cloned and analyzed, only six were absent from N. punc-tiforme. One of the six DNA fragments contained within cosmid pNAM123 had a predicted aromatic amino acid specificity code (Asp235, Ala236, Ser239, Thr278, Ile299, Ala301, Gly322, Ile330) (21) and was selected as the candidate Crp pathway A domain for unit B. Sig-nificantly, PCR primers designed from the pNAM123 DNA insert (see Methods) generated an amplicon from Nostoc sp. GSV 224 genomic DNA whose sequence was 98% identical to the pNAM123 insert (data not shown). As further evidence that the Crp biosynthetic gene clus-ters from Nostoc sp. GSV 224 and Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 are virtually identical, a fosmid was cloned from Nostoc sp. GSV 224 that partially contained crpD and encompassed all of the downstream genes associated with Crp production. The overlapping DNA sequences from Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and Nostoc sp. GSV 224 were None99.9% identical and contained crpE, crpF, crpG, and crpH in the same order (Figure 2). Interestingly, the DNA sequences from both species were essentially identical up to the transposase region, after which they diverged completely, suggesting that the crp gene clus-ters were integrated at different genomic loci within the two species. These data also provide evidence that crpH represents the terminus of the Crp biosynthetic gene cluster. Probing a Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 cosmid library provided pDHS500, whose insert was sequenced and found to contain NRPS and PKS genes consistent with the predicted architecture for the 3=-half of the Crp pathway. Additional library probing using PCR-based screening provided pDHS501 that overlapped with pDHS500 and contained the complete upstream PKS gene portion of the putative crp cluster.",
        "The crp gene cluster (40,304 bp) is flanked by trans-posases and inverted repeats (interestingly, the curacin A and jamaicamide cyanobacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (18, 22) are also flanked by transposases) that appear to represent the limits of the metabolic system (Figure 2). The first open reading frame (ORF) within crp is a type I PKS gene (8823 bp) that is followed by a second modular PKS gene (10,407 bp) and then two modular NRPS genes (5829 and 10,029 bp) designated crpA-D. A series of ORFs (crpE-H) downstream of the Crp PKS and NRPS genes are predicted to encode enzymes that catalyze functional group modifications (e.g., epoxi-dation (crpE) and chlorination (crpH)) present in 1 and many of its analogues.

        "Proposed Assembly of the Cryptophycins. Biosyn-thesis of Type I PKS-Unit A: None-Hydroxy-phenyloctenoic Acid. As a first step toward unraveling the biosynthetic origin of unit A in the cryptophycins, sodium [1,2-13C2]acetate was provided in precursor incorporation studies to Nostoc sp. GSV 224 (Figure 1 and Supplemen-tary Experiment A). In this experiment the precursor was diluted with unlabeled acetate to minimize the forma-tion of interconnected [1,2-13C2]acetate units. The 1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of labeled 1 (Figure 1) appeared as a 1:0.64:1.2 cluster of peaks (1.8%) for the signals of six contiguous carbons in unit A, specifically C1 to C6, which was consistent with the incorporation of three intact acetate units. Each triplet was composed of a singlet for the natural abundance 13C flanked by peaks of a doublet for the incorporated 13C. The level of 13C enrichment (integration of doublet/integration of singlet) averaged 1.1%. The coupling constants associ-ated with the doublets rigorously established that the three intact acetate units had been assimilated into C1\u2013C2, C3\u2013C4, and C5\u2013C6. No 13C enrichment was observed in any of the other carbon signals for unit A. Similar results were obtained when sodium [U-13C3]pyru-vate was provided as a precursor to the cyanobacterium.",

The 2H-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of the labeled 1 exhib-ited enhanced signals (1.8%) for C2 and C6 and isotopi-cally shifted 13C signals for C4. The C4 signals were found in a 1:0.6:1.2 triplet at 36.70, 36.35, and 36.02 ppm assigned to undeuterated, monodeuterated, and dideuterated C4, respectively.

The 13C NMR spectrum of the labeled 1 showed 13C peaks (1.3% enrichment) for C1 and C5 that were isotopically shifted upfield from the natural abundance lines by 0.03 and 0.04 ppm, respec-tively. This result revealed that essentially all of the 18O on the 13C incorporated into C1 and C5 from this precur-sor had been retained. A precursor incorporation experiment with L-[methyl-13C]methionine established that the methyl group on C6 of unit A originates from the C1 pool (Figure 1 and Supplementary Experiment D). The 13C NMR spectrum showed a substantial enhancement (15%) of the carbon signal at None 13.5. The origin of the remaining carbons in unit A (i.e., C7, C8, and those in the phenyl group) were shown to be phenylalanine-derived from a precursor incorporation experiment with L-[U-13C9-15N]phenylalanine (Supple-mentary Experiment E). The precursor was provided to Nostoc sp. GSV 224, and the bacterial culture was har-vested and processed for 1.

On the basis of these precursor incorporation results, phenylacetyl-CoA is a potential starter unit for the biosynthesis of unit A in 1 with chain elongation proceeding by a sequential addi-tion of three malonate units (Figure 1 and Figure 3, panel a). However, feeding experiments with labeled phenylacetic acid and the corresponding N-acetylcyste-amine thioester failed to show incorporation. Although it might not be possible for these precursors to be trans-ported across the cyanobacterial cell membrane, it is con-ceivable that another starter unit is involved (see below). Recently, the origin of the starter unit of the cyano-bacterial toxin microcystin (Mcy) was investigated by testing in vitro the activation and acylation of a series of candidate aryl and amino acids by McyG loading module (23). Acceptable substrates for the A loading domain were phenylpropanoids with McyG showing the highest selectivity toward trans-cinnamic acid. Interest-ingly, the CrpA A domain amino acid specificity code is identical to the corresponding McyG A domain, and thus, it is possible that trans-cinnamic acid functions as the Crp starter unit since it is also derived from phenyl-",

        "The precursor incorporation studies described above are consistent with the established three-module domain organization of CrpA (A-ACP-KS-AT-DH-CM-KR-ACP) and CrpB (KS-AT-KR-ACP-KS-AT-DH-KR-ACP) that are collinear with the 1 unit A structure (Figure 2). Several structural variations that deviate from the col-linearity rule in the CrpA/B PKS are noteworthy. One is the smaller macrocycle (14-membered ring) found in cryptophycin 26 (Table 1), which is unique compared to all other cryptophycins. Formation of cryptophycin 26 requires that the C3 hydroxyl group serves as the nu-cleophile for CrpD TE mediated ring closure (16). By-passing of the CrpB dehydratase (DH) might preserve the C3 hydroxyl group in cryptophycin 26 as well as cryp-tophycin 30 (Table 1). In another natural analogue (cryp-tophycin 327) a C-2/C-3 cis-double bond occurs instead of the C-2/C-3 trans-double bond common to all other cryptophycins. The CrpB KR2 domain is predicted to be responsible for C3 ketoreduction, and its amino acid sequence is coincident with an S-specific KR (or type B) based on bioinformatics analysis (24\u201326) (Figure 3, panel c), consistent with the C-2/C-3 double bond. Pre-sumably the CrpB KR2 domain also generates an R C-3 stereoisomer at a low level, with the CrpB DH2 catalyzing dehydration to the C-2/C-3 cis olefin.",

        "Apd NRPS (28). We propose the CrpC and ApdB-M3 methyltransferases (O-methylation of tyrosine) are a new type of NRPS domain that specify O-methylation, which is supported by unique amino acid sequence motifs (Figure 3, panel d). Both the ApbB-M3 and CrpC methyltransferase domains lack a core N-methyltrans-ferase amino acid sequence motif (M3), and residues within core methyltransferase motifs M1 and M2 are dif-ferent. Following the presumed OMet domain are A domain motifs (A9 and A10) of unknown function, a PCP domain, and an epimerase (E) domain (27) that is pre-dicted to catalyze the conversion of L-tyrosine to D-tyrosine. Unit B is structurally modified by mono-or dichlorination of the tyrosine subunit (Table 1). It remains to be determined whether halogenation occurs at the subunit stage to generate a precursor pool of chlo-rotyrosine or during a later stage of natural product assembly. CrpH, whose gene (crpH) represents the presumed terminus of the crp gene cluster is the predicted haloge-nase responsible for modification of tyrosine at the posi-tion ortho to the OMet moiety (Supplementary Table 1). Database comparisons with the deduced CrpH peptide sequence revealed that it resembles a number of previ-ously described non-heme flavin-dependent haloge-nases, including those from the rebeccamycin (29) and pyoluteorin (30) pathways. We expect that CrpH is responsible for mono-and dichlorination of the aromatic ring of unit B for the various Crp natural products. Unit C of 1 is methyl-None-alanine, whereas in a small number of analogues (e.g., cryptophycins 18, 24, 29, 176, 326; Table 1) None-alanine is incorporated for the elongation step. In primary metabolism, phosphopan-thetheine formation requires None-alanine that is in turn derived from aspartate via a PanD decarboxylase (31). To determine if methyl None-alanine is formed from methyl-aspartate (MASP), a MASP synthesis (32) was devel-oped using [13C]iodomethane instead of iodomethane to provide a 1:1 (SR/SS) diastereomeric mixture of the compounds (Supplementary Experiment I). This enabled precursor incorporation studies using a 13C-labeled methyl group in cultures of Nostoc sp. GSV 224. A 1.4% enrich-ment of 13C label from [methyl-13C]-(2S,3R/S)-3-MASP in the methyl group of unit C in 1 demonstrated that unit C is derived from this biosynthetic subunit (Figure 1). In ad-dition, feeding studies using [U-13C]pyruvate resulted in intact incorporation of pyruvate into the methyl-None-alanine unit (Figure 1 and Supplementary Experiment J).",
        "The only other natural product that is known to contain methyl-None-alanine is vicenistatin. However, a combina-tion of feeding studies and analysis of the DNA se-quence of the entire vicenistatin biosynthetic cluster (33) indicates a unique origin for this subunit. Spe-cifically, the methyl-None-alanine unit is presumably de-rived from glutamate that is rearranged by a glutamate mutase to form MASP and finally decarboxylated by a pyridoxal-5=-phosphate-dependent decarboxylase (33, 34). Intact incorporation of pyruvate by the Crp biosyn-thetic pathway is inconsistent with the formation of MASP derived by rearrangement from glutamic acid and suggests that MASP in Nostoc may originate from a biosynthetic pathway analogous to branched chain amino acid biosynthesis. The primary sequence of CrpG is similar to various PanD enzymes (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, when 13C-labeled S-methyl-None-alanine was fed to cultures of Nostoc sp. GSV 224, it was incorporated with a percent yield comparable to the incorporation of the R-isomer (Supplementary precursor-directed biosynthesis). It appears that the CrpD A2 domain does not discriminate between these diastereo-meric forms of the subunit. This result suggests that CrpG displays high selectivity toward R-MASP to afford the 2R-stereoisomer of methyl-None-alanine. The ability of the CrpD-M1 A domain to activate methyl-None-alanine/None-alanine is predicted based on its sequence similarity to previously characterized (21) None-alanine A domains (Figure 3, panel b). Mosaic NRPS/PKS Module. Unit D: Variation and Incorporation of Branch Chain None-Hydroxy Acids. On the basis of reasonable biosynthetic principles, it was evident that unit D of 1 is derived from None-hydroxyiso-caproic acid. Interestingly, None-hydroxyisovaleric acid, None-hydroxyisobutyric acid, or None-hydroxyvaleric acid is also incorporated based on the structures of several natural Crp analogues (Table 1; cryptophycins 19, 21, 49, 50, 54, 326). We sought to determine if L-leucine is the direct precursor for unit D by conducting precursor in-corporation experiments with DL-[5-2H3]leucine (Sup-plementary Experiment K) and with L-[1-13C]leucine (Figure 1, Supplementary Experiment L). In feeding experiments with DL-[5-2H3]leucine, 1 was isolated and shown to have a 2H resonance at 0.827 ppm (1.8% incorporation). Intact and equal incorporation (0.5%) of the methyl side chains derived from leucine into the unit D methyl groups was evident in the 13C NMR spec-trum of 1 isolated from these Nostoc cultures.

        "ing studies with L-[1-13C]leucine, the 13C NMR spectrum showed incorporation of 1% of the label from C-1 of the precursor into C-1 of unit D. Precursor incorporation studies with None-hydroxyisocaproic acid, however, did not result in labeled cryptophycins (Supplementary Experiment M). Unlike None-hydroxyisocaproic acid, None-ketoisocaproate is a common leucine biosynthesis intermediate (35), formed from leucine via transamina-tion. The direct contribution of None-ketoisocaproate to unit D was tested by precursor incorporation studies with None-[1-13C]ketoisocaproic acid. 1 extracted from the result-ing cultures was subjected to 13C NMR analysis that showed enhancement (0.9%) of the ester carbonyl (Figure 1; Supplementary Experiment N). On the basis of the required conversion of leucine to the correspond-ing None-keto acid, we surmise that CrpF, a putative non-heme oxygenase (Supplementary Table 1), might catalyze oxidative deamination of leucine yielding None-ketoisocaproate. Final KR-mediated reduction (see below) would be required to generate the nascent unit D precursor.",
        "The final module within the Crp PKS/NRPS is the second module of CrpD (CrpD-M6) that bears an NRPS-like elongation module (C3-A4-KR4-PCP3) and the termi-nal TE domain, CrpD TE (16) (Figure 2). Following pre-sumed activation and transfer of None-ketoisocaproic acid to the CrpD-M6 PCP3, the tethered None-keto acid might serve as a substrate for the upstream KR-like domain. In polyketide biosynthesis, KR domains have been demon-strated to reduce None-keto groups with no reported prece-dent for None-keto reducing KRs. The valinomycin (vlm) (36) and cereulide (ces) (37) NRPSs contain dehydrogenases similar to that found in CrpD. One of the ces dehydroge-nases was recently demonstrated to catalyze None-keto reduction of a thioester bound 2-keto isocaproyl-PCP substrate (38).",

Recently the fumonisin-A PCP-C didomain was shown to catalyze this type of ester bond formation (39).

Our demonstration that phenylalanine is con-verted into a substrate for the CrpA A1 domain sug-gested that analogues of this amino acid might provide insight into CrpA initiation domain flexibility. As an initial experiment, we used p-methylphenylalanine for precur-sor incorporation, which led to the new metabolite cryp-tophycin 111 (Table 2 and Supplementary Information). Further experiments included a diverse set of phenylala-nine analogues, including those with larger p-alkyl chains (i.e., ethyl and alkyl hydroxyl) and more bulky ring systems (naphthyl and biphenyl), cyano-appended rings, and para-substituted halides (Cl, Br, F, and I) (Table 2). In each case, new cryptophycins were gener-ated with expected starter units, revealing that the Crp loading domain is remarkably flexible. Interestingly, many of these amino acids were also incorporated within unit B (Table 2). Moreover, this work demon-strates that the Crp PKS/NRPS is able to channel and process alternative substrates of varying structural com-plexity (Table 2). In most cases, the new compounds obtained were modified by the presumed CrpE CYP450, revealing significant tolerance of the epoxidase toward unnatural substrates (Table 2).",
        "The in vivo specificity of the CrpH halogenase was also investigated by adding CaBr2 and CaI2 to the cya-nobacterial culture medium. Surprisingly, both bromine and iodine were incorporated into unit B, indicating an additional opportunity for in vivo generation of diverse products (Table 2). This was particularly intriguing in view of recent reports that replacement of chlorine for iodine has not been observed previously in natural product halogenases (40). Interestingly, the epoxidized product of the brominated molecule (Table 2; cryptophy-cin 104) was extracted from the bacterial culture, but the",

Flexibility of the Crp pathway unit C enzymes was investigated by evaluating precursor incorporation using None-alanine, and (2S)-3-aminoisobutyric acid. Both of these amino acids were incorporated into unit C with complete downstream processing to the expected cyclic depsipeptide structures (Table 2; cryptophycins 24, 29,",

On the basis of precursor incorporation studies showing that the CrpD A domain is tolerant of unnatural subunits, we sought to test whether the Crp biosynthetic machinery was capable of forming cryptophycin 52 in vivo. Direct supplementation of gem-dimethyl None-alanine to Nostoc cultures resulted in a product that was shown by NMR to",

        "Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Cryptophycin 2: Sequential Synthesis from Seco-cryptophycin 4 Using CrpD TE/CrpE P450. Recently, we reported the ability of excised CrpD TE to catalyze in vitro macrocyclization of several acyl-peptide SNAC variants of Crp chain-elon-gation intermediates (16). One of the depsipeptide products obtained from the TE was desoxycryptophycin 2, the presumed substrate for the Crp epoxidase. The desoxycryptophycins have significantly reduced bioac-tivity, and it is installation of the None-epoxide that repre-sents a significant challenge in Crp total synthesis. The Crp epoxidase was readily identified as the putative product of crpE whose deduced amino acid sequence is similar to numerous CYP450s involved in hydroxylation or epoxidation. To explore its specific function, the gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli to provide a soluble histidine tagged/maltose-binding protein variant (data not shown). Incubation of CrpE with cryptophycin 4 resulted in None75% conversion to a com-pound with a mass consistent with cryptophycin 2 (Figure 4). Scale-up provided sufficient quantities of the epoxidized material to confirm by 1H NMR that the com-pound is a single diastereomer (i.e., the None-epoxide) and identical in all respects to cryptophycin 2 (42). This result confirms that CrpE is the Crp epoxidase that enables efficient, stereospecific installation of a None-epoxide into the cryptophycins. As an additional dem-onstration of the flexibility of this system, we employed the seco-cryptophycin 4 intermediate in a tandem in situ reaction that included CrpD TE, CrpE, and all required cofactors (see Methods). This experimental system pro-vided direct isolation of cryptophycin 2 as a single product without the need to purify the desoxycryptophy-cin 2 intermediate (Figure 4). Effective in vitro reconstitu-tion of these two final biosynthetic steps promises immediate access to new cryptophycins in the search for improved anticancer lead compounds.",
        "In summary, the cyanobacterial symbiont-derived Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and the highly related Nostoc sp. GSV 224 produce the crytophycin natural products. These compounds have shown significant potential as anticancer therapeutic agents, and a number of ana-logues are currently being explored as clinical candi-dates. In this report, we focused on five allied studies, including (i) cloning, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis of the Crp gene cluster, (ii) precursor incorpora-tion studies to reveal the specific source of each biosyn-thetic subunit, (iii) precursor directed biosynthesis to probe the flexibility of Crp metabolic enzymes involved in chain assembly, cyclization, and tailoring, (iv) identifi-cation and functional analysis of the CrpE CYP450 that catalyzes None-epoxide formation to yield 1 and related analogues, and (v) tandem in vitro assembly of crypto-phycin 2 from seco-cryptophycin 4 using CrpD TE and CrpE reconstituted in a single reaction vessel.",
        "Because of the remarkable number of secondary meta-bolic gene clusters associated with Nostoc sp. genomes, a comparative analysis was employed to survey the com-plete secondary metabolome of N. punctiforme and use it as a tool to identify the crp gene cluster in both Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and Nostoc sp. GSV 224. To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural product gene cluster iden-tification using a comparative metabolomic strategy, made possible by the availability of a full genome sequence in a highly related species. Previous studies have shown the close phylogenetic relationship between lichen cyanobionts (43), but our reported strategy probes further the potential value of investigating cyanobiont phylogeny and secondary metabolism.",
        "A particularly significant characteristic of the Crp bio-synthetic system is its ability to generate None25 related natural products that include alterations in subunit structures, including units A, B, C, and D, depsipeptide ring size (14 vs 16), and variations in tailoring reactions, including epoxidation and halogenation. Subunit A structural variants are presumably derived from impre-cise PKS processing reactions, including Crp module 3 KR3 and DH2 domains. These events result in variant double bond configuration or presence of a second hydroxyl group at C-3 in unit A (Table 1). NRPS enzymes involved in assembly of units B, C, and D show flexibil-ity in amino acid and None-hydroxy acid subunit selectivity, resulting in the incorporation of diverse, yet related, extender groups. Tailoring reactions involving the crpE-encoded halogenase can result in one or two chlorine atoms in the unit B aromatic ring of tyrosine.

        "METHODS General Microbiology and Molecular Biology Procedures: Chemicals, Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and DNA Subcloning. Molecular biology reagents and enzymes were sup-plied by New England Biolabs except for Pfu (Stratagene), dNTPs (Takara), T4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen), pSMART-HCKan (Lucigen), and Wizard SV PCR Clean-up kit (Promega). When necessary, other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nostoc cul-tures were routinely maintained on BG-11 agar plates prepared as previously described (44). Nostoc strains prepared for genomic DNA extraction and production of Crp were grown in BG-11 medium (44) at 28 \u00b0C with constant illumination (9 W m\u20132) and aeration. The E. coli strains used for cloning and plasmid harvesting were XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) and TOP-10 (Invitrogen). Protein overexpression was performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen). All E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and when necessary supplemented with 25 Noneg mLNone1 kanamycin. Preparation and manipulation of plasmid DNA from E. coli were accomplished using standard methods (45). DNA sequencing was performed at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core or the University of Minnesota Advanced Genetic Analysis Center using ABI Prism sequencers and the dye termination method. Subtractive Analysis of Nostoc A and KS Domains. Amplicons encoding both KS domain (None750 bp) and A domain fragments (None1100 bp) were obtained using conditions and PCR primers described previously (46, 47). The resulting amplicons were cloned into the sequencing vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and 96 clones bearing inserts for both KS and A domains were selected for DNA sequencing. Sequences of KS and A domains were com-pared by multiple sequence alignment using the Clustal X program (48) (version 1.82) with A and KS domains from the deduced sequence of NRPSs and PKSs encoded by ORFs identi-",

High molecular weight genomic DNA was harvested from Nostoc sp. ATCC 53789 and Nostoc sp. GSV 224 according to established protocols (49) and also using a FASTDNA spin kit (Qbiogene). For cosmid library construction total Nostoc DNA was partially digested using Sau3AI, dephosphorylated, and size selected (36\u201340 kb) using a CHEF gel with a CHEF-DR III PFGE system (Biorad), followed by ligation into BamHI-digested SuperCos1 (Stratagene). The ligation mixture was packaged using the Giga-pack III XL Packaging Extract Kit (Stratagene), and the resulting library was titered and amplified according to manufacturer instructions. Fosmid libraries were constructed in an analogous fashion but without prior restriction enzyme digestion, and blunt-ended fragments were cloned directly into pCC1Fos fosmid according to manufacturer instructions (Epicentre). The insert within pNAM123 (encoding a portion of an A domain) was liber-ated by EcoRI digestion, and the resulting DNA fragment was radiolabeled using the RadPrime labeling kit (Pharmacia) with [None-32P] dCTP (Amersham) according to manufacturer directions. The radiolabeled fragments were used to probe the genomic library using standard colony hybridization protocols (45). The cosmid pDHS500, identified from probing with the pNAM123 insert, was fully sequenced using a shot-gun cloning approach where pDHS500 was fragmented in a nebulizer (IPT Medical Products, Inc.) with the following parameters, 4.4 None 104 Pa of N2 for 4.0 min. Likewise, the fosmid DNA from pDHS501 was nebulized and the 2\u20136 kb fragments collected. The resulting pDHS500 and 501 fragments were blunt-ended by Klenow and T7 DNA polymerase and phosphorylated by treatment with T4 kinase and ATP immediately prior to fractionation on a low melting agarose gel.

The sequences of pUC18 and pSMART-HCKan inserts were trimmed to remove sequences of SuperCos-1 and pCC1Fos and assem-bled into contigs using the SeqMan 5.06 program of the DNASTAR software package. The pDHS501 fosmid was identi-fied by a PCR-screening strategy employing primers designed from the crpD TE region (16) and a second set (5=-GCATTGTC-ATTTCTGGTGAGGC-3= and 5=-CCTGCTGCTAAGGCTATTTCCAAG-3=) for a portion of crpB contained within pDHS500. Two rounds of PCR were used to identify clones that produced amplicons using the PKS primers, but not the TE domain primers. The first round of PCR was used to identify plates that contained amplicons of the desired size. pDHS500 was used as a positive control for both primer sets. Ten-microliter portions of each culture from a given 96-well plate were pooled. The DNA was then used in PCR reactions using the TE and the PKS primer sets. The PCR re-actions contained 1 NoneL of pooled DNA, 1 NoneM of each primer, 200 NoneM dNTP, 5 NoneL of Taq polymerase buffer, and 0.5 NoneL of Taq DNA polymerase, and water was added to a final volume of 50 NoneL. The PCR reactions were run at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min and cycled 30 times with the program: 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. A crpB PKS amplicon was generated from one of the clones with the crpB primer set but not with the crpD TE primer set. The clone (pDHS501) producing this amplicon was identified and shown to extend from the 5= end of pDHS500. ORFs from pDHS500 and pDHS501 were identified using Vector NTI software package version 10 and their deduced amino acid sequences compared to others in the GenBank database. The domain arrangements of the Crp PKS and NRPS proteins were determined using the web-based software program PKS-NRPS (50). The PKS-NRPS program was also used to determine the pre-dicted specificity codes of the Crp NRPS A domains.

Conditions for crpE amplifications included an initial 5 min denaturation step (94 \u00b0C) and cycling conditions of 94 \u00b0C (30 s), 58.5 \u00b0C (30 s), and 72 \u00b0C (1 min 45 s) for 35 cycles followed by a final 72 \u00b0C exten-sion step (7 min). The crpE amplicon was phosphorylated using T4 kinase and ligated into pSMART-HCKan to produce pDing1. The insert within pDing1 was sequenced and shown to be free of PCR errors. pDing1 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into linear pSJ8 (EcoRI/BamHI cut). The resulting plasmid, pDing2, and chaperone expressing plasmid pGRO7 were used to cotransform E. coli BL21(DE3) to ampicillin (amp) (50 Noneg mL\u20131) and chloramphenicol (chl) (25 Noneg mL mLNone1) resistance.

The culture was then cooled to 4 \u00b0C before induc-ing with 0.1 mM Isopropyl-None-D-thiogalactopyranoside and 1 g L mL\u20131 of L-arabinose. The culture was grown at 15 \u00b0C with con-stant shaking (200 rpm) for 20 h. The cells were pelleted by cen-trifugation and resuspended in 80 mL of PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 10 mM sodium hydrogen phosphate, and 1.8 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 7.4, 3 mM None-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). The cell suspen-sion was then sonicated and the lysate collected following cen-trifugation (40,000g for 45 min). The resulting supernatant was collected and incubated with pre-equilibrated amylase agarose resin at 4 \u00b0C for 3 h with agitation. The amylase agarose resin was washed (100 column volumes of lysis buffer) and MBP-His-CrpE eluted with lysis buffer containing 8 mM maltose. Maltose was removed from the protein sample with a PD-10 column, and the MBP-His-CrpE fusion protein was then treated with His-TEV protease at 4 \u00b0C overnight to remove the MBP-His portion. The CrpE protein was separated from the MBP-His polypeptide by passing the mixture through a Ni-agarose column. The concen-tration of the purified protein was determined by its predicted extinction coefficient (81,820 MNone1 cmNone1 at 280 nm). The active CrpE concentration was determined using previously described methods (51).",
