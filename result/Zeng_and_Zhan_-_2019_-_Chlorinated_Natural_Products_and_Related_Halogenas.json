Novel halometabolites isolated from nature inspire scientists to synthesize these \u201cchance compounds\u201d, which were, however, usually hampered by the extreme catalytic conditions and severe selectivity challenges. In the past several decades, enzymatic reactions have been brought into attention for their efficiency, selectivity, and mild reaction conditions. Synthetic biology which is in compliance with the laws of nature to a large extent shed light on the rational biosyn-thesis of halogenated compounds. This article summarizes several representative categories of halogenated natural products and halogenases to seek clues to the relationship between the structures and halogenase mechanisms. Some types of halogenase convert the basic building blocks to diverse early intermediates during natural product biosyn-thetic processes, while others are involved in the late tailoring steps to afford the final structures of halogenated molecules. The broad substrate specificity and strong regioselectivity exhibited in some halogenases are irreplace-able advantages for biosynthesis. In addition, tremendous efforts and encouraging results enable us to engineer the enzymes or techniques to synthesize \u201cunnatural\u201d halogen-ated natural products. More reaction mechanisms and structural data are expected to be revealed exponentially in this rapid growing realm. Keywords: Bioactivity \u00b7 biosynthesis \u00b7 biotransformation \u00b7 catalytic reactions \u00b7 halogenated compounds Halogenated compounds play a crucial role in modern pharmaceutical industry and other realms such as pesticides, dyes, detergents, etc., with significant contribution of halogen atoms to the bioactivities or reactivity. Approximately 25% of drugs on the market contributing revenue are by halogenated compounds,[1] including some well-known halogenated medi-cines such as chloramphenicol, vancomycin, and rebeccamy-cin. Half of the molecules in high-throughput screening contain halogen atoms. During the last 50 years of rapid development, the number of natural halogenated compounds has grown from 30 in 1968 to over 5000 in 2015.[2] The number is expected to increase exponentially with the help of genome mining and synthetic biology. One reason for the late initiation of natural halometabolites discovery is that halogenated compounds were usually found in the extreme environment and considered as the \u201cchance products of nature\u201d. With the discovery of more and more halogenated compounds from living organisms, scientists started to realize the roles those halometabolites played in living systems. Antibiotics with remarkable bioactivities were identified. During the process of synthesizing these antibiotics by organic total synthesis, chemists found that halogenated compounds can serve as outstanding intermediates in various types of reaction. Prior to the 1990s, most of the halogenated compounds were chemically synthesized, which often leads to severe pollution, undesired by-products, and low efficiency and poor selectivity. Therefore, new approaches of synthesiz-ing halogenated compounds are desired. Nature is infinitely better in chemistry. Halogenated compounds in living organisms are synthesized by correspond-ing enzymes. Since the first halogenase was identified in Caldariomyces fumago, more halogenases have been discov-ered and classified into four major types: haloperoxidases (HPO), nonheme Fe(II)a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogen-ases, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent halogenases and flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs). Though halogen atoms include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, their differences in atomic sizes and electronegativity lead to different enzyme capabilities. Most reported halogenases catalyze reactions with chlorine and bromine donors, while the latter is commonly observed in marine living organisms. The goal of this review is not to comprehensively summarize all chlorinated natural products, but to focus on representative halometabolites that are synthesized with the involvement of various types of halogenase. 1. Aliphatic Chlorinated Compounds Caldariomycin is a natural product that was found to be synthesized by a halogenating enzyme in Caldariomyces fumago.[3] Since then, the biosynthesis of halogenated com-pounds was brought to attention. Caldariomycin contains aliphatic carbon-halogen (CNoneX) bonds that are ubiquitous in [a] J.

KGaA, Weinheim 387 Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 medicinal drugs and bioactive metabolites. The majority of halogenases involved in aliphatic CNoneX bond formation fall into three categories: haloperoxidases providing electrophilic activation of an alkene or its equivalent by a halonium ion (X+) donor; S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent halo-genases providing nucleophilic environment at an electrophilic carbon center with a halide anion (XNone); and nonheme iron-a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases providing unactivated aliphatic CNoneH bond with a halogen radical (X \u00b7) equivalent.[4] Several representative aliphatic chlorinated compounds are listed in Figure 1. Formation of the CNoneX bond in caldariomycin is catalyzed by a chloroperoxidase. Chloroperoxidases were considered as the only type of halogenase for a long time. It catalyzes the oxidation of the halide ions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the formation of free hypohalous acids. No substrate-binding pocket was observed in the structural studies on chloroperoxidases, which implies that the electro-phile, (i. e., OClNone), is released into bulk solution and reacts with substrates directly. Therefore, the halogenation catalyzed by chloroperoxidase lacks substrate specificity and regioselec-tivity, similar to chemical halogenation in organic synthesis. In addition to caldariomycin which is catalyzed by heme-Fe haloperoxidases, vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (V-HPOs) belong to another group of hypohalite providers. Most V-HPOs were found in marine seaweeds and use bromide as the halogen donor. The family of napyradiomycin compounds are unusual chlorinated dihydroquinones reported from Strep-tomyces aculeolatus. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, napyradiomycin A1 showed antiangiogenic activity and inhibited HUVEC tube formation in a concentration-depend-ent manner. It inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and suppressed the migration and invasion of vascular endothelial cells but did not affect human dermal fibroblast proliferation. It also modulated cell permeability.[5] Three enzymes in the napyradiomycin biosynthetic pathway, including NapH1, NapH3 and NapH4, are proposed to catalyze the chlorination. The biosynthetic cyclization of the terpenoid subunits is initiated through a chloronium ion. The in vivo experiments revealed the molecular basis of V-HPOs.[6] Electrophilic carbon center with a halide anion is usually related to the SAM-dependent halogenases. Salinosporamide A (marizomib), an anticancer agent currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple-myeloma, was discovered from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica.[7] Parental cells displayed sensitivity to salinosporamide A (IC50 =5.1 nM), whereas their bortezomib-resistant sublines were 9-and 17-fold cross-resistant to salinosporamide A, respectively.[8] Salinosporamide A also exhibited impaired capacity to inhibit b5-associated catalytic activity. A chlorinase SalL was characterized and it chlorinates SAM to generate 5\u2019-chloro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine. The chlorination showed an unusual nucleo-philic substitution that is similar to a fluorinase in Streptomy-ces cattleya.[9] SalL also accepts bromide and iodide as substrates, but not fluoride.[10] Radical reaction catalyzed by nonheme iron-a-ketogluta-rate-dependent halogenases was exemplified by barbamide. Barbamide was isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula with molluscicidal activity. (LC100 = 10 mg/ml).[11] The structure of barbamide is comprised of a trichloromethyl group and the methyl enol ether of a b-keto amide (Figure 1). Two halogenating enzymes, BarB1 and BarB2, are involved in barbamide biosynthesis, with L-Leu-S-BarA as the substrate. The in vitro reconstitutions revealed that the trichlorination of unactivated carbon was carried out by these two halogenases tandemly.[12] Another iron-a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases SyrB2 was found in the syringomycin (Figure 1) biosynthetic pathway in Pseudomo-nas syringae pv. syringae.[13] Syringomycin belongs to the family of antimicrobial and phytotoxic lipodepsipeptide compounds.[14] Its prominent fungicidal activity is strongly dependent on the presence of chlorine in the C-terminal residue.[15] Syringomycin forms pores on membranes to act as non-selective ion channels, resulting in cell death via the membrane depolarization and non-controlled ion flux. SyrB2 catalyzes both mono-halogenation and di-halogenation reac-tions with threonyl-S-carrier protein as substrate.[16] A radical mechanism was proposed for SyrB2 and its crystal structure was reported.[13,17] Similarly, formation of hapalindole-type alkaloids was catalyzed by two nonheme iron-dependent Dr. Jia Zeng obtained his PhD degree in metabolic engineering at Utah State University and acquired his postdoctoral training in biochemistry and crystallography at the Univer-sity of Texas at Austin. His current research interests include tailoring enzymes in biosyn-thetic pathways of natural products including halogenases, and applying synthetic biology tools and metabolic engineering approaches to alternatively solve the current limitation of chemical synthesis in pharmaceutical applica-tions. Dr. Jixun Zhan received a Ph.D. in biochemical engineering from East China University of Science and Technology in 2003, and con-ducted postdoctoral training at the University of Arizona and the University of California, Los Angeles. He joined the Department of Bio-logical Engineering at Utah State University as an assistant professor in 2008 and was promoted to full professor in 2017. His research is focused on metabolic engineering and natural product biosynthesis. He is partic-ularly interested in discovering new bioactive molecules, understanding the biosynthetic mechanisms, and rationally generating novel derivatives through engineered biosynthesis. Isr. J.

KGaA, Weinheim www.ijc.wiley-vch.de 388 Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 halogenases, WelO5 and AmbO5.[18] 12-epi-Hapalindole E, 12-epi-fischerindole G, and welwitindolinones A\u2013C (Figure 1) are all halogenated compounds catalyzed by iron-a-ketogluta-rate-dependent halogenases, though the radical mechanism has not been reported. 2. Aromatic Chlorinated Compounds In 1995, Dairi et al. discovered a novel halogenase in the 7-chlortetracycline biosynthetic pathway, which showed a differ-ent catalytic mechanism from the previously reported haloper-oxidases.[19] The function of this enzyme was proved by knockout experiment and later characterized by in vitro reconstitution.[20] Tetracycline antibiotics are bacteriostatic agents which act to inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction, and chlortetracycline is usually used as a veterinary drug. The enzyme involved in the chlorination of tetracycline belongs to the FDH category. Apart from the differences in the primary amino acid sequence, FDHs possess stronger regioselectivity than haloperoxidases. After the first characterized FDH PrnA was reported in 1997, this class of enzymes is drawing increasing attentions in the last two decades.[21] Figure 1. Representative aliphatic chlorinated compounds. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 2.1 Early-Stage Halogenation Unlike the incorporation of the chlorine atom by an FDH in a late biosynthetic step of chlortetracycline, the majority of reported FDHs use tryptophan or other early biosynthetic precursors as starter units. Deletion of these genes resulted in the complete shutdown of the biosynthetic pathways, and thus no unchlorinated intermediates are present. Therefore, it is more favorable to classify these halometabolites as the result of early-stage halogenation. Most of these compounds were isolated from prokaryotic strains. 2.1.1 Tryptophan-Derived Chlorinated Compounds Tryptophan-derived halometabolites are well studied. They are biosynthesized with tryptophan as the starting precursor, with chlorine atoms on different positions on the indole ring. Based on the substitution positions, we can separate these chlorinated compounds into different groups (Figure 2). 2.1.1.1 Trp-2 Chlorinated Compounds Chondramides are a group of depsipeptides comprised of three amino acids and a polyketide chain. The tryptophan residue can be modified by chlorination to form chondramide B and D. Chondramides were isolated from the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5, which showed a high cytostatic activity in mammalian cell cultures. They also react against yeasts but not on filamentous fungi or bacteria.[22] Knock-out experiment of cmdE yielded chondramide A and chondramide C that lack chlorine atoms, which indicated that CmdE is a putative tryptophan 2-halogenase.[23] Due to the Figure 2. Flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases and related natural products. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 instability of free 2-chlorotryptophan, the in vitro results were not acquired. Rachid et al. deduced that CmdE function on nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) bound species or the nascent product of the NRPS. The chondramide biosynthetic enzymes can also accept 5-fluorotryptophan as the extender unit, but the chlorination was abolished due to the influence of fluorine on the indole ring.[23] 2.1.1.2 Trp-5 Chlorinated Compounds Pyrroindomycin B is an antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. It was isolated from Streptomyces rugospo-rus. Its structure contains a polyketide macro-ring and trisaccharide linkage to a pyrroloindole moiety that is derived from chlorinated tryptophan. Chlorination occurs at 5-position on the indole ring. PyrH can catalyze 5-halogenation of free tryptophan in vitro[24] (Figure 2). Similarly, ulleungmycin, a cyclic hexapeptide isolated from Streptomyces sp. KCB13F003 with 5-chlorotryptophan, exhibits moderate bioactivities against gram-positive bacteria including MRSA and quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus[25] (Figure 3). The functional halogenase has not been characterized, but it is very likely that it accepts tryptophan as substrate to generate 5-chlorotryptophan, which serves as a building block in the subsequent biosynthetic process. Not limited to hexapeptides, larger polypeptides may also contain chlorinated tryptophan as a moiety. NAI-107 from Microbispora corallina, also called microbisporicin A1, is a ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). This type of lanthipeptide exhibits antimicrobial activity and are known as lantibiotics. The structure of NAI-107 is comprised of 24 core amino acid residues, and the fourth amino acid is a 5-chlorinated tryptophan (Figure 3). Figure 3. Other halogenated compounds with tryptophan as starting precursor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 The gene mibH was later identified as an FDH reacting in the early stage of NAI-107 biosynthesis. Different from other reported tryptophan halogenases, MibH cannot work on free tryptophan.[26] Tests on the other lanthipeptides analogues showed negative results, indicating the strict substrate specific-ity of MibH. The structural analysis of MibH claimed that the substrate specificities for FDHs are related to the substrate-binding site rather than the active halide producing sites. This provides a clue to explain why different classes of FDH take different types of substrate. 2.1.1.3 Trp-6 Chlorinated Compounds Thienodolin, an indolethiophen alkaloid isolated from Strepto-myces albogriseolus, inhibits nitric oxide synthase in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells at both transcriptional and translational levels. Therefore, thienodolin can be developed into anti-inflammation and cancer chemoprevention drugs.[27] The structure of thienodolin contains a 6-chlorotryptophan moiety, which is catalyzed by the FDH ThaL. The chlorination is the first step in thienodolin biosynthesis[28] (Figure 2). Another Trp-6 halogenase SttH from Streptomyces toxytricini was reported in 2011. It may participate in the biosynthesis of a nonribosomal peptide.[29] Besides, cyclic peptides kerama-mides were isolated from marine sponges (Figure 3). Kerama-mide L showed cytotoxicity against L1210 murine leukemia cells (IC50 =0.46 mg/ml) and KB epidermoid carcinoma cells (IC50 =0.9~mg/ml) in vitro.[30] Keramamide L obtains a 6-chloro-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) structure which was catalyzed by KrmI. It exhibits a broad substrate specificity as it can halogenate both 5-HTP and free tryptophan.[31] Kutznerides are another group of natural products contain-ing the 6-chlorotryptophan moiety, but they have chlorine at both 6-and 7-positions. They are cyclic depsipeptides comprised of six nonproteinogenic residues with antifungal and antimicrobial activities, and were isolated from the soil actinomycete kutzneria sp. 744[32] (Figure 3). Two enzymes are involved in the dichlorination, including KtzQ and KtzR. KtzQ is a Trp-7 chlorinase while KtzR is a Trp-6 chlorinase. Both of them are capable of accepting free tryptophan as substrate. However, 7-chlorotryptophan is a preferred substrate for KtzR. It suggests that the dichlorination in kutznerides biosynthesis is in tandem. 7-Chlorotryptophan is first synthe-sized and then further halogenated by KtzR to generate 6,7-dichlorotryptophan, which serves as a building block in the subsequent processing.[33] 2.1.1.4 Trp-7 Chlorinated Compounds In addition to the kutznerides, other Trp-7 chlorinated compounds were reported as well. Rebeccamycin was isolated from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes and known as an anti-tumor compound which binds to DNA-topoisomerase I complex to prevent the replication of DNA[34] (Figure 2). Analogues lacking chlorine substitution have weaker antimi-crobial activity, due to the lack of cell membrane perme-ability.[35] Two indole rings containing 7-chlorine on each side suggest that 7-tryptophan are the starter units for rebeccamy-cin biosynthesis. The Trp-7 halogenase RebH was proved to be an FDH and worked together with a partner enzyme RebF (flavin reductase) with a ratio of 1 : 3 to reach the highest turnover rate.[36] Free tryptophan is the substrate for RebH, and both chlorination and bromination can occur based on the presence of different halogen donors. The broad-spectrum antifungal compound pyrrolnitrin was first isolated in 1964 from Pseudomonas pyrrocinia. 7-Chlorotryptophan is the starter unit which is catalyzed by PrnA, the first characterized FDH in 1997.[21] PrnA can halogenate free tryptophan on the C-7 position. On the other hand, the chlorination on the pyrrole ring was catalyzed by PrnC (Figure 3). However, the mechanism of the latter chlorination step is still unclear. 2.1.1.5 Engineered Tryptophan-Derived Chlorinated Compounds Compared to HPOs that generate hydrogen peroxide as an intermediate, tryptophan halogenases are more regioselective. The catalytic positions of halogenation are strictly controlled. With more and more structural biology data released, researchers found out that the substrate pockets are crucial for the regioselectivity. Therefore, several attempts have been carried out to alter the regioselectivity through rational mutagenesis. Lang et al. constructed a F103A mutation of PrnA for an expanded active site, which made this Trp-7 halogenase capable for Trp-5 halogenation[37] (Figure 4A). Similarly, based on the crystal structure of SttH, Shepherd et al. made 3 rational mutations (L460F/P461E/P462T) to switch this Trp-6 halogenase to Trp-5 halogenase[38] (Fig-ure 4B). These findings enlarged the pool of tryptophan halogenases as synthetic tools. Target metabolites with certain stereochemistry could be acquired by rational design of the active sites. Other efforts such as directed evolutions, thermo-stabilizing and enzyme fusions were carried out to seek better efficiency of these enzymes.[39] 2.1.2 Natural Products with Other Chlorinated Moieties Besides tryptophan, other chlorinated intermediates as build-ing blocks in natural product biosynthetic pathways have been revealed. Different from tryptophan halogenases, most of this type of halogenase reacted on the substrates bonded to certain carrier proteins. As shown in the phylogenetic tree in Figure 5, tryptophan halogenases are grouped together as variant A, while CndH, PltA and SgcC3 are grouped as variant B. The FDHs and their Genebank accession numbers are listed in Table 1. Variant B shares the similar function of halogenating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 Pyoluteorin is an antifungal product containing a 4,5-dichloropyrrole moiety, which is isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens.[40] The 5-position on the pyrrolyl ring was attacked by a FAD-4a-OCl intermediate first to form a 5-chloropyrrolyl intermediate and then the 4,5-dichloropyrrolyl product. The reaction was catalyzed by the FDH PltA, with the substrates covalently bound to the carrier protein. The chlorinated intermediate was further catalyzed to form pyoluteorin[41] (Figure 6). The structure of the famous antitumor antibiotic C-1027 also contains halogen atoms. C-1027 is a nine-membered enediynes from Strptomyces globisporus.[42] Deschloro-C-1027 Figure 4. The active pocket of tryptophan halogenases. (A) Comparison of Trp-5 and Trp-7 halogenases. The regioselectivity is influenced by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 was shown to be less proficient at inducing DNA double-stranded breaks and less cytotoxic, and has altered action mechanisms.[43] The 3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-b-phenylalanine moiety is crucial for the stability and reactivity of the enediyne core. It was synthesized by SgcC3 reacted on a carrier protein-tethered substrate. SgcC3 does not accept free amino acid substrates, and its function has been characterized both in vitro and in vivo[44] (Figure 6). The third example is chondrochlorens. Chondrochlorens A and B are weak antibiotics against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. They were isolated from Chondromyces crocatus, containing a chloro-hydroxy-styryl group. The halogenase CndH reacts on the tyrosinyl group tethered on a carrier protein. Similar to other variant B FDHs, CndH cannot work on free amino acids. Their substrate specificity is determined by the active sites which were further illuminated by crystal structural data[45] (Fig-ure 6). As one of the most famous antibiotics vancomycin has been studied for a long time, and the halogenase in its biosynthetic pathway was reported recently. Vancomycin is a branched tricyclic glycosylated nonribosomal peptide, pro-duced by the Actinobacteria species. Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most bacterial strains, both in vitro and in clinical infections. The halogenated heptapeptide backbone is crucial for the activity, which improves binding affinity to the D-Ala-D-Ala target against Staphylococcus aureus.[46] The chlorinase VhaA is responsible for the di-chlorination in the assembly process. The in vitro assay revealed that VhaA used peptide carrier protein-tethered hexapeptide as the substrate and introduced a chlorine atom into each aromatic ring of both b-hydroxytyrosine residues[47] (Figure 6). Some other compounds shown in Figure 7 are proposed to be catalyzed by variant B halogenases, though their functions Figure 5. Phylogenetic tree of \\FDHs from various sources. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 were not characterized. Balhimycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, was isolated from the fermentation broth of Amycolatopsis sp. Balhimycin showed bactericidal activity against both aerobes and anaerobes, including MRSA (MIC 0.39 mg/ml) and Clostridium strains (MIC 0.39 mg/ml). Post-antibiotic effect (PAE) was observed as well.[48] A halogenase gene bhaA was revealed in the biosynthesis of balhimycin.[49] Another anti-MRSA drug marinopyrrole A was from marine actinomycete CNQ-418. The research showed that the MIC of marinopyrrole A against the panel of Staphylococcus aureus strains is 0.188 to 1.5 mg/ml, while the measured MICs against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Hae-mophilus influenzae are 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml, respectively. A calculated PAE is between 4 and 6 h. Marinopyrrole A also exhibited a favorable therapeutic index, with IC50 about 32 to 64 mg/ml against HeLa cells and 8 to 32 mg/ml against L929 cells.[50] Deletion of the mpy16 gene completely abolished the production of marinopyrroles, so Mpy16 was proposed to catalyze the initiating dichlorination of pyrrolyl-S-carrier protein.[51] The brominase Bmp2 is of high similarity of Mpy16. It converts pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1(ACP) to tribromopyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 Figure 6. Natural product biosynthetic pathways involving halogenation of carrier protein-tethered substrates. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 (ACP), which is a key intermediate in tetrabromopyrrole biosynthesis.[52] Tetrabromopyrrole was isolated from Pseu-doalteromonas spp. It shows antibiotic activity against human and marine bacteria and may influence the bacterial commun-ity composition within marine biofilms.[53] The structure of pyrrole ring and increased bromination were most lethal to the coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi. Tetrabromopyrrole in-duced the production of reactive oxygen species and the release of intracellular calcium stores, to activate the cellular death pathways.[54] 2.2 Late-Stage Modification Besides the halogenated compounds from bacteria, more and more halometabolites have been discovered from eukaryotic organisms. Different from bacterial halogenation, aromatic compounds in fungi usually serve as substrates and the halogenation steps commonly occur in a late biosynthetic step. The involved halogenases have a relatively larger pocket in their active sites and may have broader substrate specificities. The first reported compound catalyzed by eukaryotic FDHs is differentiation-inducing factor 1 (DIF-1), a polyketide derived morphogen, was identified in Dictyostelium.[55] It induces prestalk-specific gene transcription in responsive cells and plays a critical role in the proper development program of the hosts. Other bioactivities in mammalian cells were also reported.[56] Lacking the chlorine atoms on DIF-1 resulted in the fragile slug phenotype. Mono-chlorination and di-chlorina-tion were observed when the halogenase ChlA used (2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-1-hexan-1-one (THPH) as the substrate.[57] The chlorination happens after the formed polyketide back-bones are released from the carrier proteins (Figure 8). The biosynthetic pathway of radicicol also contains a tailoring FDH. Radicicol is a potent heat shock protein 90 inhibitor isolated from various fungi.[58] The structure is a resorcylic acid lactone containing a chlorine atom on the aromatic ring. The radicicol biosynthetic pathway was identified in two different fungi, and two different FDH-encoding genes were revealed. One is Rdc2 from Pochonia Chlamydosporia, and the other one is RadH from Chaetomium chiversii.[59] Rdc2 was first biochemically characterized both in vitro and in vivo.[60] Monocillin IV, a stable substituent for the precursor of radicicol was tested and radicicol was synthesized (Figure 8). Changing the ratio of Rdc2 and flavin reductase led to the formation of dichlorination products. However, the dechlorinated metabolites were not detected in vivo, probably due to the high toxicity of dechlorinated compounds to the hosts. Rdc2 exhibits a broad substrate specificity. Similar aromatic compounds were tested, including dihydroresorcylide, zearalenone, curvularin and curcumin. The chlorination usually took place on the ortho-position of the phenol groups. RadH, on the other hand, showed similar catalytic properties, but cannot halogenate zearalenone or curvularin.[61] It implies that these two FDH may have some interesting differences in their active sites. In 2016, two other FDHs were characterized in chaetovir-idins and griseofulvin biosynthetic pathways, respectively. Chaetoviridins are a large family of fungal secondary metabolites isolated from Chaetomium. They are assembled Figure 7.

Chaetovirdidins A, B, C and E were further synthesized. Post-PKS modification provides chances for chemical diversity in natural product biosynthesis.[63] On the other hand, griseofulvin, isolated from Penicillium aethiopi-cum, is an antifungal drug and has been in use for many years in medical and veterinary applications due to its influence on the mitotic spindle microtubules in mitosis.[64] The chlorination was proposed to occur in the last biosynthetic step. Similar to RadH (60 % identity), GsfI was another late stage halogenase whose function has been proved by knockout experiments. This enzyme is responsible for the regiospecific chlorination at the C-13 position, which is ortho to the phenol groups[65] (Figure 8). However, the structural information remained mysterious until the crystal structure of MalA shed a light on the actual shapes of active sites for this type of FDH. Since the eukaryotic FDHs commonly react at the late stage of biosyn-thesis, a large pocket compatible for mature intermediate is necessary. malA is an FDH-encoding gene in the malbranchea-mide biosynthetic pathway. Malbrancheamide is well-known for its bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane core. This calmodulin antag-onist was isolated from Malbranchea aurantiaca, with significant vasorelaxant effect.[66] After the proposed [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition, premalbrancheamide was further chlorinated to malbrancheamide B, isomalbrancheamide B, and malbrancheamide, respectively. The conversion rates of Figure 8.

Further modification on the regioselectivity and substrate scope can be accom-plished based on the structural information[67] (Figure 8). Recently, many other promising aromatic halometabolites have been reported and are shown in Figure 9, though the related FDHs are less characterized. Ochratoxin A is a polyketide compound isolated from Aspergillus carbonarius. Ochratoxin A is harmful to grapes and derived products, and may cause nephrotoxic, teratogenic, immunotoxic, neurotoxic, hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects to human.[68] The encod-ing gene of the halogenase (AcOTAhal) shows greatest similarity to RadH, and the deletion of AcOTAhal gene results in the accumulation of Ochratoxin B. The chlorination occurs at the para position of phenol group, and AcOTAhal is highly possible to be a late stage halogenase, which remains to be further characterized in the future.[69] Dichlororugulovasines A and B were isolated from the fungus Talaromyces wortmannii. It is a rare example for eukaryotic halogenase reacting on tryptophan moieties. Both 2-and 7-positions were chlorinated. However, the correspond-Figure 9.

They were isolated from an endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici, with significant antimicrobial, antitumor, and anti-HIV activ-ities.[71] Pestheic acid was considered as the precursor of chloropupukeanane compounds, and the biosynthetic pathway of pestheic acid was revealed. PtaM was proved to be an FDH that catalyzes the late chlorination step in the pathway.[72] Tiacumicin B was isolated from various hosts such as Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subsp. Hamdenensis, Micro-monospora echinospora, Catellatospora, Actinoplanes decca-nensis, etc.[73] It exhibits strong activity against Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea at low concentrations.[74] The dichlorinated homo-orsellinic acid moiety is a key part for the activities. Interestingly, the involved halogenase TiaM is from prokaryotic hosts but catalyzes a late-stage halogenation step. Two chlorine atoms were reported to be added on the aromatic ring in sequence.[75] Another antimicrobial compound avilamy-cin A was isolated from Streptomyces viridochromogenes TU\u030857, and it shares a similar di-chloro moiety. Knockout of AviH led to the formation of a dechlorinated product. There-fore, this chlorination is also considered as a late-stage modification.[76] Aspirochlorine, isolated from koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae), is an epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETP) toxin. It shows antifungal and antibacterial activity. Monti et. al. showed that it specifically inhibits fungal protein synthesis but does not inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria or higher eukaryotes.[77] Inhibition of fungal protein synthesis by aspirochlorine is dose-dependent with a potent IC50 of about 10 nM. Inhibition of Bacillus subtilis cells is mainly on RNA synthesis. Since the koji mold was widely used in Asian countries from ancient times, inadequate research on the potent toxic metabolites brought uneasiness to the public. The chlorine in aspirochlor-ine plays a key role in the bioactivities. The dechlorinated derivative was of substantially less antifungal activities and radically reduced antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities.[78] Chlorination is the last step in the aspirochlorine biosynthetic pathway and is catalyzed by AclH. Therefore, AclH is considered another late-stage halogenase. The functions of AclH was proved by knockout and feeding experiments. 3. \u201cUnnatural\u201d Natural Halogenated Compounds Remarkable progress has been made in the past two decades towards discovering and characterizing various types of halogenase. Not satisfied with the current passive observation Figure 10. Representative \u201cunnatural\u201d halogenated natural products. Isr. J.

Since halogen atoms can enhance the bioactivities of many natural products, introducing the halide into the metabolic pathways may provide the chances to obtain new drugs with improved pharmaceutical properties. Rungu-phan et al. introduced PyrH and RebH into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus and isolated a series of chlorinated monoterpene indole alkaloids with predicted regioselectiv-ity.[79] These original compounds include 19,20-dihydroakuam-micine, ajmalicine, tabersonine and catharanthine, which showed various bioactivities, such as antiplasmodial, broncho-dilator, and acceleration of neurological function recovery, etc.[80] They share tryptophan starter units and the introduction of halogen atoms strongly proved the potential of using plants or microorganisms as synthetic biology platform (Figure 10). In addition to creating novel metabolites in vivo using halogenases, several in vitro experiments were carried out to prove the viability for assembling enzymatic tools as kits to synthesize intermediates for industrial production. The late-stage halogenase Rdc2 and RadH were tested on isoquinolines, resveratrol, coumarins, and flavonoids[61,81] (Figure 10). Halo-genation is highly regioselective that it occurred at the position ortho to the phenolic hydroxyl group. Another high-throughput screening of FDHs with docking substrates revealed that FDHs could catalyze a far greater range of substrates than previously recognized.[82] These studies inspired the chemists and biochemists to explore the potentials for halogenation in organic synthesis and synthetic biology. The studies of halogenases and their biosynthetic pathway is just at the very early stage. However, the recent progress gradually depicts a draft picture of the relationship between the structures of halogenated compounds and the pattern of the catalytic enzymes. With the development of genomic mining and synthetic biology, it is believed that the bioinformation extracted from the biosynthetic pathways and their derived macromolecules will facilitate the development of useful halogenating tools for biochemical and medicinal applications.

        "Abstract: Halogenated compounds are well-known for their diverse bioactivities and wide applications in pharmaceutical industry, chemical engineering and other fields. Novel halometabolites isolated from nature inspire scientists to synthesize these \u201cchance compounds\u201d, which were, however, usually hampered by the extreme catalytic conditions and severe selectivity challenges. In the past several decades, enzymatic reactions have been brought into attention for their efficiency, selectivity, and mild reaction conditions. Synthetic biology which is in compliance with the laws of nature to a large extent shed light on the rational biosyn-thesis of halogenated compounds. This article summarizes several representative categories of halogenated natural products and halogenases to seek clues to the relationship",
        "between the structures and halogenase mechanisms. Some types of halogenase convert the basic building blocks to diverse early intermediates during natural product biosyn-thetic processes, while others are involved in the late tailoring steps to afford the final structures of halogenated molecules. The broad substrate specificity and strong regioselectivity exhibited in some halogenases are irreplace-able advantages for biosynthesis. In addition, tremendous efforts and encouraging results enable us to engineer the enzymes or techniques to synthesize \u201cunnatural\u201d halogen-ated natural products. More reaction mechanisms and structural data are expected to be revealed exponentially in this rapid growing realm.",

        "Halogenated compounds play a crucial role in modern pharmaceutical industry and other realms such as pesticides, dyes, detergents, etc., with significant contribution of halogen atoms to the bioactivities or reactivity. Approximately 25% of drugs on the market contributing revenue are by halogenated compounds,[1] including some well-known halogenated medi-cines such as chloramphenicol, vancomycin, and rebeccamy-cin. Half of the molecules in high-throughput screening contain halogen atoms. During the last 50 years of rapid development, the number of natural halogenated compounds has grown from 30 in 1968 to over 5000 in 2015.[2] The number is expected to increase exponentially with the help of genome mining and synthetic biology.",
        "One reason for the late initiation of natural halometabolites discovery is that halogenated compounds were usually found in the extreme environment and considered as the \u201cchance products of nature\u201d. With the discovery of more and more halogenated compounds from living organisms, scientists started to realize the roles those halometabolites played in living systems. Antibiotics with remarkable bioactivities were identified. During the process of synthesizing these antibiotics by organic total synthesis, chemists found that halogenated compounds can serve as outstanding intermediates in various types of reaction. Prior to the 1990s, most of the halogenated compounds were chemically synthesized, which often leads to severe pollution, undesired by-products, and low efficiency and poor selectivity. Therefore, new approaches of synthesiz-ing halogenated compounds are desired.",

        "compounds in living organisms are synthesized by correspond-ing enzymes. Since the first halogenase was identified in",
        "Caldariomyces fumago, more halogenases have been discov-ered and classified into four major types: haloperoxidases (HPO), nonheme Fe(II)a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogen-ases, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent halogenases and flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs). Though halogen atoms include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, their differences in atomic sizes and electronegativity lead to different enzyme capabilities. Most reported halogenases catalyze reactions with chlorine and bromine donors, while the latter is commonly observed in marine living organisms. The goal of this review is not to comprehensively summarize all chlorinated natural products, but to focus on representative halometabolites that are synthesized with the involvement of various types of halogenase.",

The majority of halogenases involved in aliphatic CNoneX bond formation fall into three categories: haloperoxidases providing electrophilic activation of an alkene or its equivalent by a halonium ion (X+) donor; S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent halo-genases providing nucleophilic environment at an electrophilic carbon center with a halide anion (XNone); and nonheme iron-a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases providing unactivated aliphatic CNoneH bond with a halogen radical (X \u00b7) equivalent.[4] Several representative aliphatic chlorinated compounds are listed in Figure 1.",
        "Formation of the CNoneX bond in caldariomycin is catalyzed by a chloroperoxidase. Chloroperoxidases were considered as the only type of halogenase for a long time. It catalyzes the oxidation of the halide ions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the formation of free hypohalous acids. No substrate-binding pocket was observed in the structural studies on chloroperoxidases, which implies that the electro-phile, (i. e., OClNone), is released into bulk solution and reacts with substrates directly. Therefore, the halogenation catalyzed by chloroperoxidase lacks substrate specificity and regioselec-tivity, similar to chemical halogenation in organic synthesis.",
        "In addition to caldariomycin which is catalyzed by heme-Fe haloperoxidases, vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (V-HPOs) belong to another group of hypohalite providers. Most V-HPOs were found in marine seaweeds and use bromide as the halogen donor. The family of napyradiomycin compounds are unusual chlorinated dihydroquinones reported from Strep-tomyces aculeolatus. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, napyradiomycin A1 showed antiangiogenic activity and inhibited HUVEC tube formation in a concentration-depend-ent manner. It inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and suppressed the migration and invasion of vascular endothelial cells but did not affect human dermal fibroblast proliferation. It also modulated cell permeability.[5] Three enzymes in the napyradiomycin biosynthetic pathway, including NapH1, NapH3 and NapH4, are proposed to catalyze the chlorination. The biosynthetic cyclization of the terpenoid subunits is initiated through a chloronium ion. The in vivo experiments revealed the molecular basis of V-HPOs.[6]",
        "Electrophilic carbon center with a halide anion is usually related to the SAM-dependent halogenases. Salinosporamide A (marizomib), an anticancer agent currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple-myeloma, was discovered from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica.[7] Parental cells displayed sensitivity to salinosporamide A (IC50 =5.1 nM), whereas their bortezomib-resistant sublines were 9-and 17-fold cross-resistant to salinosporamide A, respectively.[8] Salinosporamide A also exhibited impaired capacity to inhibit b5-associated catalytic activity. A chlorinase SalL was characterized and it chlorinates SAM to generate 5\u2019-chloro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine. The chlorination showed an unusual nucleo-philic substitution that is similar to a fluorinase in Streptomy-ces cattleya.[9] SalL also accepts bromide and iodide as substrates, but not fluoride.[10] Radical reaction catalyzed by nonheme iron-a-ketogluta-rate-dependent halogenases was exemplified by barbamide. Barbamide was isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula with molluscicidal activity. (LC100 = 10 mg/ml).[11] The structure of barbamide is comprised of a trichloromethyl group and the methyl enol ether of a b-keto amide (Figure 1). Two halogenating enzymes, BarB1 and BarB2, are involved in barbamide biosynthesis, with L-Leu-S-BarA as the substrate. The in vitro reconstitutions revealed that the trichlorination of unactivated carbon was carried out by these two halogenases tandemly.[12] Another iron-a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases SyrB2 was found in the syringomycin (Figure 1) biosynthetic pathway in Pseudomo-nas syringae pv. syringae.[13] Syringomycin belongs to the family of antimicrobial and phytotoxic lipodepsipeptide compounds.[14] Its prominent fungicidal activity is strongly dependent on the presence of chlorine in the C-terminal residue.[15] Syringomycin forms pores on membranes to act as non-selective ion channels, resulting in cell death via the membrane depolarization and non-controlled ion flux. SyrB2 catalyzes both mono-halogenation and di-halogenation reac-tions with threonyl-S-carrier protein as substrate.[16] A radical mechanism was proposed for SyrB2 and its crystal structure was reported.[13,17] Similarly, formation of hapalindole-type alkaloids was catalyzed by two nonheme iron-dependent",

Therefore, thienodolin can be developed into anti-inflammation and cancer chemoprevention drugs.[27] The structure of thienodolin contains a 6-chlorotryptophan moiety, which is catalyzed by the FDH ThaL. The chlorination is the first step in thienodolin biosynthesis[28] (Figure 2). Another Trp-6 halogenase SttH from Streptomyces toxytricini was reported in 2011. It may participate in the biosynthesis of a nonribosomal peptide.[29] Besides, cyclic peptides kerama-mides were isolated from marine sponges (Figure 3). Kerama-mide L showed cytotoxicity against L1210 murine leukemia cells (IC50 =0.46 mg/ml) and KB epidermoid carcinoma cells (IC50 =0.9~mg/ml) in vitro.[30] Keramamide L obtains a 6-chloro-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) structure which was catalyzed by KrmI. It exhibits a broad substrate specificity as it can halogenate both 5-HTP and free tryptophan.[31]",
        "Kutznerides are another group of natural products contain-ing the 6-chlorotryptophan moiety, but they have chlorine at both 6-and 7-positions. They are cyclic depsipeptides comprised of six nonproteinogenic residues with antifungal and antimicrobial activities, and were isolated from the soil actinomycete kutzneria sp. 744[32] (Figure 3). Two enzymes are involved in the dichlorination, including KtzQ and KtzR. KtzQ is a Trp-7 chlorinase while KtzR is a Trp-6 chlorinase. Both of them are capable of accepting free tryptophan as substrate. However, 7-chlorotryptophan is a preferred substrate for KtzR. It suggests that the dichlorination in kutznerides biosynthesis is in tandem. 7-Chlorotryptophan is first synthe-sized and then further halogenated by KtzR to generate 6,7-dichlorotryptophan, which serves as a building block in the subsequent processing.[33]",
        "2.1.1.4 Trp-7 Chlorinated Compounds",
        "In addition to the kutznerides, other Trp-7 chlorinated compounds were reported as well. Rebeccamycin was isolated from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes and known as an anti-tumor compound which binds to DNA-topoisomerase I complex to prevent the replication of DNA[34] (Figure 2).",
        "Analogues lacking chlorine substitution have weaker antimi-crobial activity, due to the lack of cell membrane perme-ability.[35] Two indole rings containing 7-chlorine on each side suggest that 7-tryptophan are the starter units for rebeccamy-cin biosynthesis. The Trp-7 halogenase RebH was proved to be an FDH and worked together with a partner enzyme RebF (flavin reductase) with a ratio of 1 : 3 to reach the highest turnover rate.[36] Free tryptophan is the substrate for RebH, and both chlorination and bromination can occur based on the presence of different halogen donors. The broad-spectrum antifungal compound pyrrolnitrin was first isolated in 1964 from Pseudomonas pyrrocinia. 7-Chlorotryptophan is the starter unit which is catalyzed by PrnA, the first characterized FDH in 1997.[21] PrnA can halogenate free tryptophan on the C-7 position. On the other hand, the chlorination on the pyrrole ring was catalyzed by PrnC (Figure 3). However, the mechanism of the latter chlorination step is still unclear.",

        "Compared to HPOs that generate hydrogen peroxide as an intermediate, tryptophan halogenases are more regioselective. The catalytic positions of halogenation are strictly controlled. With more and more structural biology data released, researchers found out that the substrate pockets are crucial for the regioselectivity. Therefore, several attempts have been carried out to alter the regioselectivity through rational mutagenesis. Lang et al. constructed a F103A mutation of PrnA for an expanded active site, which made this Trp-7 halogenase capable for Trp-5 halogenation[37] (Figure 4A). Similarly, based on the crystal structure of SttH, Shepherd et al. made 3 rational mutations (L460F/P461E/P462T) to switch this Trp-6 halogenase to Trp-5 halogenase[38] (Fig-ure 4B). These findings enlarged the pool of tryptophan halogenases as synthetic tools. Target metabolites with certain stereochemistry could be acquired by rational design of the active sites. Other efforts such as directed evolutions, thermo-stabilizing and enzyme fusions were carried out to seek better efficiency of these enzymes.[39]",

SgcC3 does not accept free amino acid substrates, and its function has been characterized both in vitro and in vivo[44] (Figure 6).",
        "The third example is chondrochlorens. Chondrochlorens A and B are weak antibiotics against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. They were isolated from Chondromyces crocatus, containing a chloro-hydroxy-styryl group. The halogenase CndH reacts on the tyrosinyl group tethered on a carrier protein. Similar to other variant B FDHs, CndH cannot work on free amino acids. Their substrate specificity is determined by the active sites which were further illuminated by crystal structural data[45] (Fig-ure 6). As one of the most famous antibiotics vancomycin has been studied for a long time, and the halogenase in its biosynthetic pathway was reported recently. Vancomycin is a branched tricyclic glycosylated nonribosomal peptide, pro-duced by the Actinobacteria species. Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most bacterial strains, both in vitro and in clinical infections. The halogenated heptapeptide backbone is crucial for the activity, which improves binding affinity to the D-Ala-D-Ala target against Staphylococcus aureus.[46] The chlorinase VhaA is responsible for the di-chlorination in the assembly process. The in vitro assay revealed that VhaA used peptide carrier protein-tethered hexapeptide as the substrate and introduced a chlorine atom into each aromatic ring of both b-hydroxytyrosine residues[47] (Figure 6).

Different from bacterial halogenation, aromatic compounds in fungi usually serve as substrates and the halogenation steps commonly occur in a late biosynthetic step. The involved halogenases have a relatively larger pocket in their active sites and may have broader substrate specificities.",

Other bioactivities in mammalian cells were also reported.[56] Lacking the chlorine atoms on DIF-1 resulted in the fragile slug phenotype. Mono-chlorination and di-chlorina-tion were observed when the halogenase ChlA used (2,4,6-",

Radicicol is a potent heat shock protein 90 inhibitor isolated from various fungi.[58] The structure is a resorcylic acid lactone containing a chlorine atom on the aromatic ring. The radicicol biosynthetic pathway was identified in two different fungi, and two different FDH-encoding genes were revealed. One is Rdc2 from Pochonia Chlamydosporia, and the other one is RadH from Chaetomium chiversii.[59] Rdc2 was first biochemically characterized both in vitro and in vivo.[60] Monocillin IV, a stable substituent for the precursor of radicicol was tested and radicicol was synthesized (Figure 8). Changing the ratio of Rdc2 and flavin reductase led to the formation of dichlorination products. However, the dechlorinated metabolites were not detected in vivo, probably due to the high toxicity of dechlorinated compounds to the hosts. Rdc2 exhibits a broad substrate specificity. Similar aromatic compounds were tested, including dihydroresorcylide, zearalenone, curvularin and curcumin. The chlorination usually took place on the ortho-position of the phenol groups. RadH, on the other hand, showed similar catalytic properties, but cannot halogenate zearalenone or curvularin.[61] It implies that these two FDH may have some interesting differences in their active sites. In 2016, two other FDHs were characterized in chaetovir-idins and griseofulvin biosynthetic pathways, respectively. Chaetoviridins are a large family of fungal secondary metabolites isolated from Chaetomium. They are assembled",
