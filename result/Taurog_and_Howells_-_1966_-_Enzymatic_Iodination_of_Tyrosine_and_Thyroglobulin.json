Enzymatic Iodination of Tyrosine and Thyroglobulin with Chloroperoxidase* (Received for publication, October 11, 19G5) ALVIN TAUROG~ ASD EARL &I. HOWELLS~ From the Department of Pharmacology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas 75235 SUMMARY 1. Crystalline chloroperoxidase is effective in catalyzing the iodination of tyrosine or thyroglobulin when supplemented with HzOz, or with the H20z-generating system, glucose-glucose oxidase. The iodination reaction is very rapid at low concentrations of iodide (5 X 10-5 M), and at low con-centrations of tyrosine (1 X 10V4 M) or thyroglobulin (0.33 mg per ml). 2. Iodide is rapidly bound as 3-iodotyrosine, 3,5-diiodo-tyrosine, and thyroxine during the chloroperoxidase-cata-lyzed iodination. After 60 min of incubation with thyro-globulin as acceptor, chromatography of a Pronase digest showed approximately 45 to 50 % of the added nlI in the form of 3,5-diiadotyrosine, about 20 to 25% as 3-iodotyrosine, and 4 to 5% as thyroxine. 3. Since iodination of thyroglobulin occurred very effec-tively in the presence of only a single crystalline enzyme, the results suggest that it may not be necessary to postulate the existence of a separate \u201ctyrosine iodinase\u201d in the thyroid. Moreover, the formation of appreciable thyroxine in the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin sug-gests that a peroxidase may also be involved in the coupling reaction in the thyroid. 4. The chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of tyrosine and thyroglobulin is greatly accelerated by 0.1 M chloride and bromide. The mechanism of this stimulatory effect is not yet known, although several possibilities are discussed. 5. Iodination of thyroglobulin and tyrosine in the presence of chloroperoxidase is readily inhibited by low concentrations of antithyroid drugs and by naturally occurring reducing agents such as cysteine, reduced glutathione, and ascorbic acid. Results obtained with these inhibitors support the view that antithyroid compounds act as competitive inhibitors in the formation of organic iodine in the thyroid. 6. Excess iodide inhibits the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of tyrosine and thyroglobulin. These results suggest that the antithyroid effect of iodide, observed under * Supported by Grant AM-03612 from the United States Public Health Service.

Chloroperoxidase is very effective in catalyzing iodina-tion of insulin and serum albumin. 3,5-Diiodotyrosine for-mation was at least as rapid in the case of these acceptors as it was with thyroglobulin, but thyroxine formation was not as marked. These results suggest that steric arrange-ment of newly formed 3,5-diiodotyrosine residues in thyro-globulin was more favorable than in the other proteins for promoting the coupling reaction. 8. No evidence was obtained that 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvic acid (DHP) is an intermediate in the forma-tion of thyroxine during the iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase. However, when free tyrosine was iodi-nated with chloroperoxidase, evidence was obtained that DHP was involved as an intermediate. To the extent that the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin serves as a model for the thyroid coupling reaction, these results suggest that DHP is not an intermediate in thyroxine formation in the thyroid. Iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, or in its subunits, is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine in the thyroid gland. By analogy with iodination reactions carried out in the laboratory, it is generally believed that iodide ion (the form in which iodine enters the gland) must first be oxidized to a higher oxidation state before it can iodinate tyrosine. Of the known biological oxidizing agents, only Hz02 and O2 are involved in oxidation-reduction couples that possess, at pH 7, a higher oxidation-reduction potential than the couple 21-+ Iz (+ 0.535 volt). It is hardly surprising, therefore, that H202 has long been implicated as the agent responsible for oxidizing iodide in the thyroid. Histochemical evidence for the presence of a peroxidase in thyroid tissue was reported by Dempsey in 1944 (I), and this was confirmed and extended by others (2-4). However, early at-tempts to demonstrate peroxidase activity in thyroid extracts were unsuccessful (5). More recently, primarily because of the work of Alexander (6) and of Serif and Kirkwood (7), there has been a renewed interest in the occurrence of a thyroid peroxidase. 1329 This is an Open Access article under theCC BY Alexander reported that rat thyroid and salivary homogenates iodination contained 300 mpmoles of tyrosine, 236 mpmoles of catalyzed the iodination of added tyrosine in the presence of I-(containing 10 to 20 PC of 13iI-), 3 mg of glucose, 12.5 pg of glucose and glucose oxidase as a hydrogen peroxide-generating glucose oxidase, 0.3 mmole of Cl-, 0.04 pg of chloroperosidase, system, and he concluded that a tissue peroxidase was involved in and 0.1 N sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.9, in a total volume of 3 the reaction.

Experiments were performed, therefore, in which stable iodine, as well as r311, was measured. Typical results are shown in Table II, which also outlines the 1332 Enzymatic Iodination with Chloroperoxidase Vol. 241, No. 6 mymoles of utilized -* &\u2019 l 6.5 I I I 0 IO 20 30 40 50 60 Minutes FIG. 3.

A net increase in the stable iodine content of the thyroglubulin was observed which agreed quite well with that calculated from the l3rI data. Although it is not possible to rule out a small amount of exchange, these results indicate that, under the conditions used here, 1311 is incorporated into thyro-globulin primarily by a reaction involving net iodination. Effect of pH on Iodinatkn of Thyroglobulin-As shown in Fig. 3, the rate of iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase rapidly diminished as the pH was raised from 4.9. It is unlikely that this was due to an effect on the glucose-glucose oxidase system, since the pH optimum of glucose oxidase is quite broad (21). It seems most likely that the pH effect shown in Fig. 3 reflects a fall in the activity of chloroperoxidase itself. This would be expected from the pH optimum curve for chloroperoxi-dase-catalyzed chlorination of P-ketoadipic acid, previously obtained by Shaw and Hager (16). Experiments were also performed at pH 4.2, but under these conditions thyroglobulin precipitated from solution. Results for this pH, therefore, are not included in Fig. 3. Formation of S-Iodotyrosine, 3,5-Diiodotyrosine, and Thyroxine during Iodination of Tyrosine with Chloroperoxidase-The rates of formation of both 3-iodotyrosins and 3,5-diiodotyrosine in the presence and in the absence of 0.1 N Cl-are shown in Fig. 4. In the early stages of the reaction, 3-iodotyrosine formation far exceeded 3,5-diiodotyrosine formation. However, in the presence of Cl-, 3,5-diiodotyrosine formation became quite appreciable after 15 min, and by 60 min the quantity of added iodine bound as 3,5-diiodotyrosine exceeded that bound as 3-iodotyrosine. These results indicate that the latter compound is also an acceptor for the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, and Fig. 5 shows results of a separate experiment comparing rates of iodination of t,yrosine and 3-iodotyrosine, under condi-tions similar to those used to obtain the data shown in Fig. 4. It is evident that iodination of 3-iodotyrosine occurred as readily as iodination of tyrosine. When the amount of chloroperoxidase added to the reaction mixture was increased from 0.04 pg to 0.16 pg, 3,5-diiodotyrosine and 3-iodotyrosine formation reached a peak within the first 10 min, and thereafter began to decline (Table III). The decline in these products was accompanied by the appearance of a large fraction of the 13rI just below the solvent front. This activity, which generally consisted of two separate but poorly resolved components, comprised as much as 37% of the total is11 after 60 min of incubation (Table III). The fact that these bands appeared only after the formation of considerable r3rI-3 ,5-diiodotyrosine and 1311-3-iodotyrosine suggested that they were products of the action of chloroperoxidase on the iodotyrosines. This was supported by the results of separate experiments in which mI-3,5-diiodotyrosine, instead of tyrosine, was incubated with the chloroperoxidase system (1311-omitted in this case). In addition, under these conditions, a prominent i3%labeled solvent front component was a major product of the reaction. Considerable deiodination of 1311-3, 5diiodotyrosine was also observed. This probably explains why there was no further decrease in \u20183%iodide after 20 min when 0.16 pg of chloroperoxi-dase was added in the iodination of tyrosine (Table III). Very likely, both iodination and deiodination were occurring simul-taneously. When only 0.04 pg of chloroperoxidase was added, the front running components became noticeable only after about 60 min, and deiodination was much less apparent. A surprising observation was the appearance of a band that moved identically with thyroxine on chromatograms prepared from reaction mixtures containing 0.16 pg of chloroperoxidase mpmoles of utilized FIG. 5.

This band was easily detectable in the 30-min sample, but it was not observed even after 60 min in samples incubated with only 0.04 pg of chloroperoxidase. The thyroxine band also appeared when 13\u20191-3, 5-diiodotyrosine was incubated with chloroperoxidase (0.16 1.18\u2019). Thyroxine was never seen unless there was also considerable activity at the solvent front, and it always appeared later in time than the front running bands. One of the front running bands has been identified as 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde by paper chromatography both in collidine-NH&OH and in butanol-acetic acid-water. As pointed out by Shiba and Cahnmann (22), 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxy-benzaldehyde is readily formed from 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvic acid, and the finding of labeled 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde on the chromatogram suggests that DHPl is an intermediate in the formation of thyroxine when tyrosine or 3,5-diiodotyrosine is incubated with the chloro-peroxidase system. (See Reference 23 for a discussion of pre-vious studies on the nonenzymatic formation of thyroxine from DHP.) Ljunggren (24) studied the oxidation of 1311-3 ,Bdiiodo-tyrosine by horseradish peroxidase at pH 7.4 and identified DHP and 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde as oxidation products. However, he did not find any appreciable yield of thyroxine under his conditions, and he attributed this to rapid degradation of any formed thyroxine by the high concentrations of peroxide and peroxidase employed in his experiments. Formation of 2%Iodotyrosine, S ,&Diiodotyrosine, and Thyroxine during Iodination of Thyroglobulin with Chloroperoxidase-Fig. 6 shows results of an experiment in which thyroglobulin was io-dinated with the complete system described in Table I. Total organic iodine formation was measured by the percentage of the added 1311 that remained at the origin of the filter paper chro-matogram. Rates of formation of the individual iodinated amino acids were determined by analysis of chromatograms of Pronase digests. Approximately 10% of the la11 in the Pronase digest remained at the origin of the chromatogram.

This would be expected from the fact that preformed 3-iodotyrosine is present in thyroglobulin, and from the finding (Fig. 5) that free 3-iodo-tyrosine is readily iodinated by chloroperoxidase. Thus, forma-tion of 3,5-diiodotyrosine may occur from the outset when thyro-globulin is iodinated with chloroperoxidase, whereas, when tyrosine is the starting acceptor, time is required to build up a sufficient concentration of 3-iodotyrosine so that it too can act as acceptor. Even with thyroglobulin iodination, however, 3-iodotyrosine was the major product 10 min after the start of the reaction. This may reflect a greater abundance of tyrosyl residues than 3-iodotyrosine residues in the thyroglobulin, or the relative rates of iodination of the peptide-linked amino acids may not necessarily correlate with t,he data for the free amino acids shown in Fig. 5. Of particular interest in Fig. 6 was the observation that a significant amount of 1311-thyroxine was formed during thyro-globulin iodination. At 30 min, 3.0% of the total 1311 was located in the thyroxine area of the chromatogram, and by 60 min this value had risen to 3.9%. No further increase was observed at 120 min. Many similar experiments were performed, and the thyroxine fraction generally contained 4 to 5% of the added W. To prove more conclusively the identity of the 1311-thyrox-ine formed during iodination of thyroglobulin, chromatography was also performed in two additional solvents, butanol-ethanol-2 N N&OH (5:1:2) and tert-amyl alcohol saturated with 0.5 N N&OH. Radioautograms obtained in such an experiment are shown in Fig. 7. In each case, the added thyroxine marker cor-responded exactly with the band on t,he radioautogram labeled thyroxine. There was no visible band corresponding to the added 3\u2019) 3,5-triiodothyronine marker. In contrast to the results obtained with tyrosine iodination, formation of thyroxine during thyroglobulin iodination was not preceded by the appearance of a front running component. 1311 in the solvent front region of the chromatogram comprised less than 1% of the total, and this was generally not visible as a distinct band on the radioautogram. It seems likely, therefore, that formation of thyroxine during iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase does not involve DHP as an intermediate, Enzymatic Iodination with Chloroperoxidase Vol. 241, No. 6 FIG. 7. Radioautograms of paper chromatograms showing I311 distribution in thyroglobulin iodinated with chloroperoxidase. Thyroglobulin was incubated for 60 min with chloroperoxidase in the standard incubation system, then digested with Pronase. The digest was extracted with butanol, concentrated, and chro-matographed in three different solvents with added thyroxine (T4), 3\u2019,3,5-triiodothyronine (Ta), 3,5-diiodotyrosine (LX!\u2018), and 3-iodotyrosine (MIT), carriers. In all solvents, the band labeled thyroxine coincided exactly with the added thyroxine carrier. although further studies are necessary to completely exclude this possibility. It should be noted also that the yield of 131-thyroxine formed during thyroglobulin iodination was about twice that formed during tyrosine iodination, or by the action of chloro-peroxidase on *311-3,5-diiodotyrosine. Substitution of 11202 for Glucose-Glucose Oxidase-The curves in Fig. 8 show the time course of the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin when various concentrations of Hz02 were substituted for the glucose-glucose oxidase hydrogen per-oxide-generating system. It is evident that iodination proceeded very readily under these conditions. The distribution of 13rI among 3,5-diiodotyrosine, 3-iodotyrosine, and thyroxine was also similar to that observed in the standard system with glucose and glucose oxidase. These results indicate that it is not neces-sary to generate H202 continuously to obtain marked iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase. Neither thyroglobulin nor chloroperoxidase appeared to be rapidly degraded by HzOz under the conditions of these experiments. In the absence of chloroperoxidase, iodination of thyroglobulin was negligible, even at the highest concentration of Hz02 used (1 x 10-a M). The curves in Fig. 8, unlike those in Figs. 2 and 6, do not show an initial lag period. This suggests that the lag in Fig. 2 is due to some delay in the formation of Hz02 by the glucose-glucose oxidase under the present conditions of incubation. This view is also supported by experiments in which 50 c(g of glucose oxi-dase, instead of the usual 12.5 pg, were added. In this case also there was no initial time lag. Effect of Various Inhibitors on Iodination of Thyroglobulin with Chloroperoxidase--As shown in Table IV, t\u2019he chloroper-oxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin was readily in-hibited by a variety of compounds. Included among these were the antithyroid compounds, l-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole, thiouracil, and thiourea, and the naturally occurring reducing agents, cysteine, glutathione, and ascorbic acid. It has been suggested that the latter two compounds may play a physiological role in regulating iodination of tyrosine in the thyroid (25, 26). Iodination was also blocked by cyanide, a known inhibitor of heme enzymes. Somewhat unexpected was the potent inhibitory effect of KSCN, which is usually considered to exert most of its antithyroid action by interference with iodide transport. As shown in Table IV, KSCN inhibited iodination about 95%, even when present at the relatively low concentration of 5 x 10-5 M. Perchlorate, on the other hand, which like thiocyanate also blocks I-transport, had very little inhibitory effect on iodination even when tested at 1 x 10e3 M. The chelating agent EDTA and the --SH-blocking agent N-ethylmaleimide also had little or no inhibitory effect when tested at 1 x 10m3 M. Al-though not shown in Table IV, tyrosine iodination was also blocked by the agents that inhibited thyroglobulin iodinat\u2019ion. The inhibitory effects shown in Table IV were based on a 15 min incubation period. When the reaction was allowed to continue for 60 min, there was a marked escape from inhibition in the case of most of the compounds tested. This is illustrated in Fig. 9, which shows time curves for the iodination of thyro-globulin carried out in the presence of different concentrations of 1-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole. When 2 X 10e4 M of the latter was added, the iodination was completely blocked for 60 min. However, when only 6.7 x 10m6 M of this reagent was added, there was some escape from the block by 30 min, and by 60 min the iodination had proceeded to about 90% completion. Similar findings were observed with many of the other inhibitory compounds shown in Table IV. These results suggest hat the inhibitory compounds themselves were oxidized by chloroper-oxidase plus H202, and that I-was oxidized only after the con-centration of inhibitor was reduced to a low level. Similar observations were previously made by Morris, Eberwein, and Hager (27), who showed that thiouracil is a competitive inhibitor in the chlorination of monochlorodimedon with chloroperoxidase, and that thiouracil itself is oxidized by chloroperoxidase in the presence of a halogen anion. These investigators suggested that compounds such as thiouracil exert their antithyroid effects by competing with tyrosine residues of t~hyroglobulin for en-zyme-bound iodinium ion. A similar conclusion has been reached by Maloof and Soodak (28)) although these invest,igators previously proposed (29) that, in the thyroid, competition occurs between thiocarbamide drugs and iodide for a common oxidizing system. The results shown in Fig. 9 support the view that thiocarbamide drugs act as competitive inhibitors in the iodina-tion of thyroglobulin, but the results obtained here do not define the actual site of the inhibitory effect.

Incubation time was results were obtained for the 3-iodotyrosine and 3,5-diiodotyro-sine components of thyroglobulin (results for the latter are shown in Fig. 10). The values for 1311-thyroxine were so low at the highest I-concentrations that it was not possible to determine with any accuracy the effect of excess I-on thyroxine formation. An inhibitory effect of excess I-was also observed when tyro-sine was iodinated with chloroperoxidase, as illustrated in Fig. 11. The maximum rate of I-utilization occurred at about 5 x 10P5 M I-, compared with approximately 1 X 10e4 M I-for maximal I-utilization with thyroglobulin as acceptor. The mechanism of the inhibitory effect of excess I-on thyro-globulin and tyrosine iodination has not yet been established. At least two possibilities deserve consideration: (a) substrate inhibition, i.e. inhibition of chloroperoxidase by excess I-, and (b) product inhibition, i.e. inhibition of chloroperoxidase by IZ, or some other form of oxidized I-. In the latter connection it is of interest that IZ was detectable by starch test at those I-con-centrations at which iodination of thyroglobulin was inhibited.

The fact that normal thyroids are only temporarily inhibited by excess I-may be explained by the hypothesis recently advanced by Braverman and Ingbar (30) that the thyroid I-transport mechanism nor-mally adapts to high I-levels by excluding excess I-from the cells. However, if excess I-does manage to enter the thyroid follicle, then perhaps it exerts its antithyroid action by inhibit-ing thyroid peroxidase. lo&nation of Proteins Other than Thyroglobulin with Chloro-peroxidase-As shown in Table V, bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, and crystalline beef insulin were also very readily iodinated by the standard iodinating system employed for thyroglobulin. The various proteins were compared at equiva-lent concentrations of tyrosine, 5 x 10-s M, based on the known percentage of tyrosine in each protein. mI-I-was also added at a concentration of 5 X lo+ M. Of particular interest was the observation that *alI-thyroxine was formed not only with thyroglobulin as acceptor, but also with the other proteins tested. This supports the view that W-thyroxine formation in thyroglobulin represented net syn-thesis, and not merely exchange. Also of interest was the observation that thyroxine formation did not correlate with 3,5-diiodotyrosine formation. Iodination of insulin produced the greatest yield of 3,5-diiodotyrosine, yet thyroxine formation was much the lowest in this case. The thyroxine value for insulin in Table V is even relatively too high, since the values shown were not corrected for an appreciable paper background occurring all along the chromatograms.

Most likely the 3,5-diiodotyrosine residues must be favorably located within the peptide chain to permit coupling between 2 of these molecules. Of the proteins tested, thyroglobulin showed the highest thyrox-ine formation, and presumably, therefore, contained 3,5-diiodo-tyrosine residues in the most favorable steric relationship for coupling. Iodination of Thyroglobulin with Horseradish Peroxidase-Purified horseradish peroxidase was tested at levels of 0.5, 1, and 10 pg per incubation tube, compared to 0.16 pg of chloroper-oxidase. Conditions of incubation were as described for the complete system in Table I. As shown in Fig. 12, horseradish peroxidase was very effective in catalyzing the iodination of thyroglobulin when it was added in sufficient amounts, although the specific activity of the enzyme was considerably less than that of chloroperoxidase.

As shown in Fig. 12 and in Table VI, Cl-had no effect on the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin. Stimulation by Cl-, therefore, is not a general property of per-oxidases. The pH optimum of horseradish peroxidase, however, did resemble that of chloroperoxidase, since horseradish per-oxidase, like chloroperoxidase, was much more active at pH 4.9 than at pH 7.0. DISCUSSION The observations reported here provide ample indication that chloroperoxidase is very effective in catalyzing the iodination of tyrosine and thyroglobulin when supplemented either with Hz02 or with a glucose-glucose oxidase HzOz-generating system. Chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of tyrosine has also been observed by Hager et al. (31). It is of particular interest that both the oxidation of I-and its transfer to the acceptor occur in the presence of a single, crystalline peroxidase. While it has not yet been determined whether the peroxidase is involved in both these reactions (or only in the oxidation step), it is apparent that iodination of thyroglobulin may occur very effectively in the presence of only a single peroxidase system. Our findings, together with those previously reported by Klebanoff et al. (lo), suggest that it may not be necessary to postulate the existence of a separate \u201ctyrosine iodinase\u201d in the thyroid gland. There is no convincing evidence at the present time that two separate enzymes are required for iodination in the thyroid gland (a peroxidase for oxidation of I-and an iodinase for transfer to the acceptor), although this is a prevalent view (32, 33). It is also of great interest that thyroglobulin, as well as tyrosine, acts as acceptor in the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, since there is little doubt that, in the thyroid gland, thyroglobulin, and not free tyrosine, is the physiological substrate for iodination (34-38). The starting thyroglobulin, obtained from rabbit thyroids, contained 0.74% total iodine, and this increased to almost 2% upon iodination with chloroperoxidase in the presence of 8 X 1O-6 M I-. Experiments were also performed with rat thyroglobulin, purified on DEAE-cellulose, and in this case, too, enzymatic iodination with chloroperoxidase proceeded readily. Most investigators who have attempted to isolate an iodide peroxidase from the thyroid have assayed their preparations with tyrosine as acceptor (9-14). Only Hosaya, Kondo, and Ui (8) have reported studies with a thyroid peroxidase in which thyroglobulin was used as acceptor. It is reasonable to expect that a thyroid peroxidase that is physiologically involved in iodination should readily iodinate thyroglobulin, especially since it has now been demonstrated that chloroperoxidase displays such marked activity in this respect. To what extent iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroper-oxidase may serve as a model for iodination mechanisms in the thyroid gland is open to question, but the following observations may be cited as evidence in support of this view. (a) Thyro-globulin, as well as tyrosine, is a substrate for the iodination reaction. (b) The iodination reaction is very rapid at concentra-tions of I-and thyroglobulin that may be considered physiologi-cal. (c) The reaction products are similar, qualitatively and quantitatively, to those observed in experiments with thyroid tissue. (d) The activity of the enzyme is completely inhibited by antithyroid compounds at concentrations that may be at-I<nzymatic I&nation with Chloroperoxidase Vol. 241, T\\\u2018o. 6 tained in vivo. (e) The inhibitory effect of excess iodide on the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed reaction resembles the inhibitory effect of excess I-on iodination in thyroid tissue, observed under certain conditions (30). On the other hand, the observation that iodination with chloroperoxidase is almost negligible at pH 7.0 suggests that, in this respect, the chloroperoxidase system differs from the thyroid system. Measurements of thyroid intracellular pH have given values near 7 (39). The marked enhancement of the chloroperosidase system by Cl-also suggests a difference from the thyroid iodinating system. The mechanism by which Cl-increases the iodinating activity of chloroperoxidase remains unknown, but experiments have been performed which eliminate some of the possibilities. It was suggested by Hager2 that Cl-might stabilize the enzyme during the incubation and prevent its deterioration during exposure to excess HzOz. However, when chloroperoxidase was preincubated with the glucose-glucose oxidase system for 15 min in the absence of Cl-, it was still as effective in catalyzing iodination of thyro-globulin as a control sample preincubated in the presence of 0.1 M Cl-. Results were the same whether or not thyroglobulin was present during the preincubation. These observations indicate that Cl-does not exert its effect by maintaining the stability of the chloroperoxidase. Another possibility is that Cl-acts as an intermediate in the reaction, by reacting first with HzOz in the presence of chloroperoxidase to form an oxidized chlorine inter-mediate. The latter might then be the immediate agent which oxidizes I-to its iodinating form. Against this view is the observation of Shaw and Hager that at pH 4.9, Cl-is not very effectively oxidized by chloroperoxidase (16). Experiments were performed to determine whether labeled ICl might be formed in the presence of Cl-. For this purpose, chromatog-raphy was performed in butanol-acetic acid water. While no definite conclusions could be drawn, it appeared from these results that ICl formation was not a significant factor in the Cl-enhancement of iodination. At present, therefore, the mecha-nism of the Cl-stimulation remains unknown. It is of interest that Cl-also stimulates the I--catalyzed reduction of ceric ion by arsenite (40), a reaction used routinely in t,he quantitative determination of small amounts of iodine. The mechanism of this stimulation is also unknown, and whether or not it possesses features in common with the Cl-stimulated chloroperoxidase iodination remains to be determined. The observation that appreciable thyroxine formation occurred during the iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase suggests that a peroxidase enzyme may be involved in the coupl-ing reaction as well as in the iodination reaction. Possible involvement of a peroxidase enzyme in the coupling of 2 molecules of 3,5-diiodotyrosine to form thyroxine was suggested in 1942 by Westerfeld and Lowe (41), based on studies of peroxidase oxidation of p-cresol. Evidence for such a mechanism was reported by Yip and Klebanoff (42), who obtained a very small yield of i311-thyroxine when they incubated i3iI-3, 5-diiodotyrosine with myeloperoxidase or with a thyroid particulate preparation. Klebanoff et al. (10) had previously studied the iodination of tyrosine with purified myelo-and lactoperoxidase, and these workers suggested that a single peroxidase enzyme might be involved not only in the iodination step, but also in the generation of H202 via the peroxidation of reduced pgridine nucleotides. While no attempt was made in the present study to use peroxidase 2 L. P. Hager, personal communication. itself to generate HaOs, the other observations of Klebanoff et a/. were confirmed and extended. We have been able to demon-strate in a single experiment, with thyroglobulin as accept.or and with a crystalline peroxidase, both the iodination of tyrosine residues and the conversion of some of those residues to thyroxine. Since no definite intermediates were observed on the chromato-grams, this suggests that coupling of two diiodotyrosines occurred within the matrix of the thyroglobulin molecule. No involve-ment of free DHP was suggested, although when free tyrosine was iodinated, the chromatographic results suggested that DHP was an intermediate. A recent report by Toi, Salvatore, and Cahnmann (43) demonstrated that free DHP may couple with 3,5-diiodotyrosine residues in thyroglobulin to form thyrox-ine. It remains to be determined whether the model suggested by Toi et al., involving free DHP, or the model suggested by our experiments, in which coupling appears to occur without any free intermediate, most nearly parallels thyroxine formation within the thyroid gland. ,lcknowZedgments-We are greatly indebted to Dr. Lowell I\u2019.

Since iodination of thyroglobulin occurred very effec-tively in the presence of only a single crystalline enzyme, the results suggest that it may not be necessary to postulate the existence of a separate \u201ctyrosine iodinase\u201d in the thyroid. Moreover, the formation of appreciable thyroxine in the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin sug-gests that a peroxidase may also be involved in the coupling reaction in the thyroid. 4. The chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of tyrosine and thyroglobulin is greatly accelerated by 0.1 M chloride and bromide. The mechanism of this stimulatory effect is not yet known, although several possibilities are discussed. 5. Iodination of thyroglobulin and tyrosine in the presence of chloroperoxidase is readily inhibited by low concentrations of antithyroid drugs and by naturally occurring reducing agents such as cysteine, reduced glutathione, and ascorbic acid. Results obtained with these inhibitors support the view that antithyroid compounds act as competitive inhibitors in the formation of organic iodine in the thyroid. 6. Excess iodide inhibits the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of tyrosine and thyroglobulin.

Chloroperoxidase is very effective in catalyzing iodina-tion of insulin and serum albumin. 3,5-Diiodotyrosine for-mation was at least as rapid in the case of these acceptors as it was with thyroglobulin, but thyroxine formation was not as marked. These results suggest that steric arrange-ment of newly formed 3,5-diiodotyrosine residues in thyro-globulin was more favorable than in the other proteins for promoting the coupling reaction.",
        "8. No evidence was obtained that 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvic acid (DHP) is an intermediate in the forma-tion of thyroxine during the iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase. However, when free tyrosine was iodi-nated with chloroperoxidase, evidence was obtained that DHP was involved as an intermediate. To the extent that the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin serves as a model for the thyroid coupling reaction, these results suggest that DHP is not an intermediate in thyroxine formation in the thyroid.",
        "Iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, or in its subunits, is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine in the thyroid gland. By analogy with iodination reactions carried out in the laboratory, it is generally believed that iodide ion (the form in which iodine enters the gland) must first be oxidized to a higher oxidation state before it can iodinate tyrosine. Of the known biological oxidizing agents, only Hz02 and O2 are involved in oxidation-reduction couples that possess, at pH 7, a higher oxidation-reduction potential than the couple 21-+ Iz (+ 0.535 volt). It is hardly surprising, therefore, that H202 has long been implicated as the agent responsible for oxidizing iodide in the thyroid. Histochemical evidence for the presence of a peroxidase in thyroid tissue was reported by Dempsey in 1944 (I), and this was confirmed and extended by others (2-4). However, early at-tempts to demonstrate peroxidase activity in thyroid extracts were unsuccessful (5). More recently, primarily because of the work of Alexander (6) and of Serif and Kirkwood (7), there has been a renewed interest in the occurrence of a thyroid peroxidase.",

This would be expected from the fact that preformed 3-iodotyrosine is present in thyroglobulin, and from the finding (Fig. 5) that free 3-iodo-tyrosine is readily iodinated by chloroperoxidase. Thus, forma-tion of 3,5-diiodotyrosine may occur from the outset when thyro-globulin is iodinated with chloroperoxidase, whereas, when tyrosine is the starting acceptor, time is required to build up a sufficient concentration of 3-iodotyrosine so that it too can act as acceptor.

This may reflect a greater abundance of tyrosyl residues than 3-iodotyrosine residues in the thyroglobulin, or the relative rates of iodination of the peptide-linked amino acids may not necessarily correlate with t,he data for the free amino acids shown in Fig. 5.",
        "Of particular interest in Fig. 6 was the observation that a significant amount of 1311-thyroxine was formed during thyro-globulin iodination. At 30 min, 3.0% of the total 1311 was located in the thyroxine area of the chromatogram, and by 60 min this value had risen to 3.9%. No further increase was observed at 120 min. Many similar experiments were performed, and the thyroxine fraction generally contained 4 to 5% of the added W. To prove more conclusively the identity of the 1311-thyrox-ine formed during iodination of thyroglobulin, chromatography was also performed in two additional solvents, butanol-ethanol-2 N N&OH (5:1:2) and tert-amyl alcohol saturated with 0.5 N N&OH. Radioautograms obtained in such an experiment are shown in Fig. 7. In each case, the added thyroxine marker cor-responded exactly with the band on t,he radioautogram labeled thyroxine. There was no visible band corresponding to the added 3\u2019) 3,5-triiodothyronine marker.",
        "In contrast to the results obtained with tyrosine iodination, formation of thyroxine during thyroglobulin iodination was not preceded by the appearance of a front running component. 1311 in the solvent front region of the chromatogram comprised less than 1% of the total, and this was generally not visible as a distinct band on the radioautogram. It seems likely, therefore, that formation of thyroxine during iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase does not involve DHP as an intermediate,",

        "although further studies are necessary to completely exclude this possibility. It should be noted also that the yield of 131-thyroxine formed during thyroglobulin iodination was about twice that formed during tyrosine iodination, or by the action of chloro-peroxidase on *311-3,5-diiodotyrosine.",
        "Substitution of 11202 for Glucose-Glucose Oxidase-The curves in Fig. 8 show the time course of the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin when various concentrations of Hz02 were substituted for the glucose-glucose oxidase hydrogen per-oxide-generating system. It is evident that iodination proceeded very readily under these conditions. The distribution of 13rI among 3,5-diiodotyrosine, 3-iodotyrosine, and thyroxine was also similar to that observed in the standard system with glucose and glucose oxidase. These results indicate that it is not neces-sary to generate H202 continuously to obtain marked iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase. Neither thyroglobulin nor chloroperoxidase appeared to be rapidly degraded by HzOz under the conditions of these experiments. In the absence of chloroperoxidase, iodination of thyroglobulin was negligible, even at the highest concentration of Hz02 used (1 x 10-a M).",
        "The curves in Fig. 8, unlike those in Figs. 2 and 6, do not show an initial lag period. This suggests that the lag in Fig. 2 is due to some delay in the formation of Hz02 by the glucose-glucose oxidase under the present conditions of incubation. This view is also supported by experiments in which 50 c(g of glucose oxi-dase, instead of the usual 12.5 pg, were added. In this case also there was no initial time lag.",
        "Effect of Various Inhibitors on Iodination of Thyroglobulin with Chloroperoxidase--As shown in Table IV, t\u2019he chloroper-oxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin was readily in-hibited by a variety of compounds. Included among these were the antithyroid compounds, l-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole, thiouracil, and thiourea, and the naturally occurring reducing agents, cysteine, glutathione, and ascorbic acid. It has been suggested that the latter two compounds may play a physiological role in regulating iodination of tyrosine in the thyroid (25, 26). Iodination was also blocked by cyanide, a known inhibitor of heme enzymes. Somewhat unexpected was the potent inhibitory effect of KSCN, which is usually considered to exert most of its antithyroid action by interference with iodide transport. As shown in Table IV, KSCN inhibited iodination about 95%, even when present at the relatively low concentration of 5 x 10-5 M. Perchlorate, on the other hand, which like thiocyanate also blocks I-transport, had very little inhibitory effect on iodination even when tested at 1 x 10e3 M. The chelating agent EDTA and the --SH-blocking agent N-ethylmaleimide also had little or no inhibitory effect when tested at 1 x 10m3 M. Al-though not shown in Table IV, tyrosine iodination was also blocked by the agents that inhibited thyroglobulin iodinat\u2019ion.",
        "The inhibitory effects shown in Table IV were based on a 15 min incubation period. When the reaction was allowed to continue for 60 min, there was a marked escape from inhibition in the case of most of the compounds tested. This is illustrated in Fig. 9, which shows time curves for the iodination of thyro-globulin carried out in the presence of different concentrations of 1-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole. When 2 X 10e4 M of the latter was added, the iodination was completely blocked for 60 min. However, when only 6.7 x 10m6 M of this reagent was added, there was some escape from the block by 30 min, and by 60 min the iodination had proceeded to about 90% completion. Similar findings were observed with many of the other inhibitory compounds shown in Table IV. These results suggest hat the inhibitory compounds themselves were oxidized by chloroper-oxidase plus H202, and that I-was oxidized only after the con-centration of inhibitor was reduced to a low level. Similar observations were previously made by Morris, Eberwein, and Hager (27), who showed that thiouracil is a competitive inhibitor in the chlorination of monochlorodimedon with chloroperoxidase, and that thiouracil itself is oxidized by chloroperoxidase in the presence of a halogen anion. These investigators suggested that compounds such as thiouracil exert their antithyroid effects by competing with tyrosine residues of t~hyroglobulin for en-zyme-bound iodinium ion. A similar conclusion has been reached by Maloof and Soodak (28)) although these invest,igators previously proposed (29) that, in the thyroid, competition occurs between thiocarbamide drugs and iodide for a common oxidizing system. The results shown in Fig. 9 support the view that thiocarbamide drugs act as competitive inhibitors in the iodina-tion of thyroglobulin, but the results obtained here do not define the actual site of the inhibitory effect.",

The pH optimum of horseradish peroxidase, however, did resemble that of chloroperoxidase, since horseradish per-oxidase, like chloroperoxidase, was much more active at pH 4.9 than at pH 7.0.",
        "DISCUSSION",
        "The observations reported here provide ample indication that chloroperoxidase is very effective in catalyzing the iodination of tyrosine and thyroglobulin when supplemented either with Hz02 or with a glucose-glucose oxidase HzOz-generating system. Chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of tyrosine has also been observed by Hager et al. (31). It is of particular interest that both the oxidation of I-and its transfer to the acceptor occur in the presence of a single, crystalline peroxidase. While it has not yet been determined whether the peroxidase is involved in both these reactions (or only in the oxidation step), it is apparent that iodination of thyroglobulin may occur very effectively in the presence of only a single peroxidase system. Our findings, together with those previously reported by Klebanoff et al. (lo), suggest that it may not be necessary to postulate the existence of a separate \u201ctyrosine iodinase\u201d in the thyroid gland. There is no convincing evidence at the present time that two separate enzymes are required for iodination in the thyroid gland (a peroxidase for oxidation of I-and an iodinase for transfer to the acceptor), although this is a prevalent view (32, 33).",
        "It is also of great interest that thyroglobulin, as well as tyrosine, acts as acceptor in the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, since there is little doubt that, in the thyroid gland, thyroglobulin, and not free tyrosine, is the physiological substrate for iodination (34-38). The starting thyroglobulin, obtained from rabbit thyroids, contained 0.74% total iodine, and this increased to almost 2% upon iodination with chloroperoxidase in the presence of 8 X 1O-6 M I-. Experiments were also performed with rat thyroglobulin, purified on DEAE-cellulose, and in this case, too, enzymatic iodination with chloroperoxidase proceeded readily. Most investigators who have attempted to isolate an iodide peroxidase from the thyroid have assayed their preparations with tyrosine as acceptor (9-14). Only Hosaya, Kondo, and Ui (8) have reported studies with a thyroid peroxidase in which thyroglobulin was used as acceptor. It is reasonable to expect that a thyroid peroxidase that is physiologically involved in iodination should readily iodinate thyroglobulin, especially since it has now been demonstrated that chloroperoxidase displays such marked activity in this respect.",
        "To what extent iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroper-oxidase may serve as a model for iodination mechanisms in the thyroid gland is open to question, but the following observations may be cited as evidence in support of this view. (a) Thyro-globulin, as well as tyrosine, is a substrate for the iodination reaction. (b) The iodination reaction is very rapid at concentra-tions of I-and thyroglobulin that may be considered physiologi-cal. (c) The reaction products are similar, qualitatively and quantitatively, to those observed in experiments with thyroid tissue. (d) The activity of the enzyme is completely inhibited by antithyroid compounds at concentrations that may be at-",

        "tained in vivo. (e) The inhibitory effect of excess iodide on the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed reaction resembles the inhibitory effect of excess I-on iodination in thyroid tissue, observed under certain conditions (30). On the other hand, the observation that iodination with chloroperoxidase is almost negligible at pH 7.0 suggests that, in this respect, the chloroperoxidase system differs from the thyroid system. Measurements of thyroid intracellular pH have given values near 7 (39). The marked enhancement of the chloroperosidase system by Cl-also suggests a difference from the thyroid iodinating system.",
        "The mechanism by which Cl-increases the iodinating activity of chloroperoxidase remains unknown, but experiments have been performed which eliminate some of the possibilities. It was suggested by Hager2 that Cl-might stabilize the enzyme during the incubation and prevent its deterioration during exposure to excess HzOz. However, when chloroperoxidase was preincubated with the glucose-glucose oxidase system for 15 min in the absence of Cl-, it was still as effective in catalyzing iodination of thyro-globulin as a control sample preincubated in the presence of 0.1 M Cl-. Results were the same whether or not thyroglobulin was present during the preincubation. These observations indicate that Cl-does not exert its effect by maintaining the stability of the chloroperoxidase. Another possibility is that Cl-acts as an intermediate in the reaction, by reacting first with HzOz in the presence of chloroperoxidase to form an oxidized chlorine inter-mediate. The latter might then be the immediate agent which oxidizes I-to its iodinating form. Against this view is the observation of Shaw and Hager that at pH 4.9, Cl-is not very effectively oxidized by chloroperoxidase (16). Experiments were performed to determine whether labeled ICl might be formed in the presence of Cl-. For this purpose, chromatog-raphy was performed in butanol-acetic acid water. While no definite conclusions could be drawn, it appeared from these results that ICl formation was not a significant factor in the Cl-enhancement of iodination. At present, therefore, the mecha-nism of the Cl-stimulation remains unknown. It is of interest that Cl-also stimulates the I--catalyzed reduction of ceric ion by arsenite (40), a reaction used routinely in t,he quantitative determination of small amounts of iodine. The mechanism of this stimulation is also unknown, and whether or not it possesses features in common with the Cl-stimulated chloroperoxidase iodination remains to be determined.",
        "The observation that appreciable thyroxine formation occurred during the iodination of thyroglobulin with chloroperoxidase suggests that a peroxidase enzyme may be involved in the coupl-ing reaction as well as in the iodination reaction. Possible involvement of a peroxidase enzyme in the coupling of 2 molecules of 3,5-diiodotyrosine to form thyroxine was suggested in 1942 by Westerfeld and Lowe (41), based on studies of peroxidase oxidation of p-cresol. Evidence for such a mechanism was reported by Yip and Klebanoff (42), who obtained a very small yield of i311-thyroxine when they incubated i3iI-3, 5-diiodotyrosine with myeloperoxidase or with a thyroid particulate preparation. Klebanoff et al. (10) had previously studied the iodination of tyrosine with purified myelo-and lactoperoxidase, and these workers suggested that a single peroxidase enzyme might be involved not only in the iodination step, but also in the generation of H202 via the peroxidation of reduced pgridine nucleotides. While no attempt was made in the present study to use peroxidase",
        "2 L. P. Hager, personal communication. itself to generate HaOs, the other observations of Klebanoff et a/. were confirmed and extended. We have been able to demon-strate in a single experiment, with thyroglobulin as accept.or and with a crystalline peroxidase, both the iodination of tyrosine residues and the conversion of some of those residues to thyroxine. Since no definite intermediates were observed on the chromato-grams, this suggests that coupling of two diiodotyrosines occurred within the matrix of the thyroglobulin molecule. No involve-ment of free DHP was suggested, although when free tyrosine was iodinated, the chromatographic results suggested that DHP was an intermediate. A recent report by Toi, Salvatore, and Cahnmann (43) demonstrated that free DHP may couple with 3,5-diiodotyrosine residues in thyroglobulin to form thyrox-ine. It remains to be determined whether the model suggested by Toi et al., involving free DHP, or the model suggested by our experiments, in which coupling appears to occur without any free intermediate, most nearly parallels thyroxine formation within the thyroid gland.",
