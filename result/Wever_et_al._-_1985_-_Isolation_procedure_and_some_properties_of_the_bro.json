Box 20151, 1000 HD Amsterdam (The Netherlands) (Received March 21st, 1985) Key words: Bromination activity: Bromoperoxidase purification; (A. nodosum) A large-scale isolation procedure for bromoperoxidase from the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum is described. The purified enzyme showed one major band (40 kDa) after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. The activity of the enzyme in the bromination of monochiorodi-medone was studied. The rate of the reaction showed optima between pH 4.5 and pH 6.5, the position of which was determined by the concentration of both Br -and HzO z. The enzyme was not inhibited by H202, azide or cyanide and only weakly by Br -. The K m for bromide of 12.7 mM is independent of pH (6.0-7.6). However, the K m for H 202 increased with increasing H + concentration. Bromoperoxidase was thermostable and was resistant to high concentrations of organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol and l-propanol. Introduction It is becoming increasingly clear that nature produces a wide variety of halometabolites. These vary from the iodinated thyroid hormones [1] in mammals to toxic fluorinated fatty acids produced by certain plants [2]. A huge number of halome-tabolites are also produced by fungi [3], actinomycetes [4,5] and marine organisms [5.6]. In particular, algae produce a fascinating diver-sity of extraordinary compounds, including hetero-geneous dihalide derivatives [6]. All these products show considerable antibacterial activity and may have a function against predation or act as mes-sengers in systems involved in chemical defence [6]. Although very likely, only in a few c.ases has it actually been demonstrated that peroxidases are involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites. The best studied haloperoxidase is that secreted by the fungus Caldariomyces fumago [7] and those present in red and green algae [6,8-14]. Some of the brown algae also contain peroxidase activity [15,16] and accumulate brominated compounds [17]. The peroxidases from Laminaria digitata [18] and Ascophyllum nodosum [19,20] have been partly purified and characterised. Most of the per-oxidases of marine origin are markedly thermosta-ble [11,15,21] and since these enzymes may be of potential value in the production of speciality chemicals or the biosynthesis of novel compounds of commercial interest [22], the reported thermo-stability may be of advantage. This prompted us to study the kinetic behaviour of the bromoperoxidases in more detail. Since green or red algae cannot easily be ob-tained in Dutch coastal waters, we have restricted ourselves to the brown alga A. nodosum, which grows abundantly along the shoreline. Materials and Methods A. nodosum was collected by the authors along the Afsluitdijk, near Kornwerderzand, The Nether-lands, towards the end of November. The seaweed was washed and stored frozen at -20\u00b0C. The enzymic activity of bromoperoxidase in the 0167-4838/85/$03.30 \u00a9 1985 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (Biomedical Division) 182 oxidation of Br-into HOBr was measured at 25\u00b0C by following the conversion of monochloro-dimedone (e = 20.2 mM -1 . c m  -1 at 290 nm) into monochloromonobromodimedone (e = 0.2 mM -\u2022 cm-~ at 290 nm) [13,23]. The reaction mixture contained 100 mM KBr, 0.1 M potassium phos-phate (pH 6.5), 0.2 M Na2SO 4 and 50 ~M mono-chlorodimedone and the reaction was started by the addition of 2 mM H202. Na2SO 4 was present in the assay to avoid large changes in ionic strength due to variation of buffer ion concentration with pH. H202 solutions were prepared by dilution of a 30% stock solution of perhydrol (Merck, Darms-tadt, F.R.G.). The concentration of H202 was determined spectrophotometrical ly  with an absorption coefficient of 43.6 M l. c m  1 at 240 nm [24]. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et ai. [25] with bovine serum albumin as standard\u2022 Sephacryl S-200 and DEAE-Sephacel were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden)\u2022 All other chemicals were of analytical grade. 0.2 M Tris-sulphate buffer was made up by mixing Tris with concentrated suiphuric acid to pH 8.3. Spectro-photometric measurements were performed on a Cary-17 spectrophotometer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out with 10% gels as described by Maurer [26]. Standard proteins used for molecular weight determinations ranged in molecular weight from 20 000 to 94 000. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 25\u00b0C in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate and 5% (v/v) fl-mercaptoethanol. Bromoperoxi-dase activity was detected on the gels by soaking them in 35/~M Phenol red and subsequently in a medium containing 2 mM H202, 0.1 M KBr and 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 6.5). When bromoperoxidase activity is present, Phenol red is brominated as detected by the formation of a brown colour. Alternatively, since this colour de-velopment did not last, the gels were immersed in 1 mM orthodianisidine and subsequently in 1 mM H 20 2  . Purification of bromoperoxidase Seaweed, chopped in a meat mincer, was stirred for 30 min in 2 vol. 0.2 M Tris-sulphate (pH 8.3). After centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7 g for 15 min the supernatant was removed and the pellet was again extracted with twice the volume of the same buffer. The resulting supernatant was removed and the precipitate was again extracted\u2022 The supernatants were combined, centrifuged at 14000 \u00d7 g for 25 min and concentrated to 20 1 in an Amicon hol-low-fibre apparatus with an HsP10-43HF cartridge for viscous solutions. Solid (NH4)2SO 4 was added to 80% saturation, the precipitate collected by centrifugation at 14000 \u00d7 g for 25 min and ho-mogenized in a medium containing 60% ethanol, 0.2 M Tris-sulphate (pH 8.3). After centrifugation at 14000 \u00d7g  for 25 rain, the upper phase was collected and further ethanol was added to a final concentration of 90%. The precipitate obtained after centrifugation at 14000 \u00d7 g for 25 min was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-sulphate (pH 8.3) applied to a column of DEAE-Sephacel and eluted with 0.2 M potassium phosphate/0.5 M NaC1 (pH 6.0). The fractions containing bromoperoxidase activity were pooled, dialysed against 0.1 M Tris-sulphate (pH 8.3) and applied to a column of Sephacryl S-200. Elution was performed with 0.1 M Tris-sulphate (pH 8.3) and the fractions containing the highest specific activity were pooled. Results Table I summarises the isolation procedure for the bromoperoxidase from the brown alga A. nodosum. The yield of the purified enzyme com-pared to the activity of the combined extracts was 10% and the specific activity was increased 100-fold in terms of ~tmol monochlorodimedone brominated per min per mg protein. The total amount of purified protein per kg of seaweed was about 5 mg. At first sight the extraction procedure reported here for bromoperoxidase appeared not to be very effective: even after repeated extractions of a sam-ple with Tris-sulphate buffer (pH 8.3), the same amount of bromoperoxidase activity was found after every extraction\u2022 Attempts to increase the efficiency of the extraction procedure were not successful. Neither addition of anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic or cationic detergents to the extraction medium, nor variation of the ionic strength or polarity of this buffer increased the yield. Varia-tion in pH, however, did have some effect. At pH values higher than 9, a considerably lower activity was found, whereas at low pH values no activity TABLE I PURIFICATION OF BROMOPEROXIDASE FROM A.

Other methods to disrupt these algae, e.g., use of a mechanical mortar and sand, or a Waring Blendor, did not lead to additional release of enzyme. Upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the bromoperoxidase preparation gave rise to one major band which stained for protein (Fig. 1A) and even under these denaturing conditions the enzyme catalysed the bromination of Phenol red to Bromophenol red (not shown). This reaction was specific for the peroxidase, since none of the marker proteins exhibited this reaction. From the gels it was possible to determine a relative molecu-lar mass (M  r ) of 40000. The minor bands of molecular mass higher than 401300 also stain for bromoperoxidase activity.

In order to establish the molecular weight of the bromoperoxidase, the enzyme was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column. However, all bromoperoxidase activity was found in the void volume of the column. It has been demonstrated that the bromoper-oxidase from the green alga Penicillus capitatus [12] and the red alga Bonnemaisonia hamifera [14] contain haem. The evidence that the peroxidases from the green alga Enteromorpha linza [10], and red alga Cystoclonium purpureum [8] are haemoproteins, is indirect, i.e., based mainly on the inhibition of the enzyme by cyanide and azide. Our purified enzyme preparation at a protein con-centration of 10 mg / m l  does not exhibit an ab-sorption peak in the Soret region of the optical spectrum. Also, the brominating activity of the enzyme was not inhibited by 1 mM azide, whereas 0.1 mM cyanide inhibited the reaction only tem-porarily. After a lag time which was dependent upon the cyanide concentration, bromination of monochiorodimedone reoccurred (not shown). Since it has been demonstrated in Ref. 13 that HOBr has a higher affinity for CN -than for monochlorodimedone and reacts with CN -to yield CNBr, this observation demonstrates that even when CN -does inhibit the enzymic activity of bromoperoxidase, the inhibition is incomplete and reversible.

It is, however, known that bromoperoxidase, like other haloper-oxidases [27-29], shows a pH optimum in the bromination of monochlorodimedone. Fig. 2 illustrates that the bromoperoxidase from A. nod\u2022sum also has distinct activity optima which, at a fixed concentration of Br-(Fig. \"2A), shifted to lower pH values when the concentration of H202 was increased. On the other hand, when the concentration of Br-was increased, the optima shifted to higher pH values (Fig. 2B). It can be seen from Fig. 2A that high concentrations of H 2 0  2 (1 -5  mM) do not appreciably inhibit the enzyme. Fig. 2B shows that Br-at low pH values (pH 3 . 7  5.0) inhibited the reaction to a certain extent. whereas at pH 6.5-7 the enzyme did not show saturation with 10-20 mM Br-, suggesting that the K,, for Br  lies in that order of magnitude. Indeed. from Lineweaver-Burk plots (not shown) of the rate as a function of the bromide concentra-tion it was possible to obtain a K,,, value for bromide of 12.7 _+ 3.0 mM (n = 13). This value, as well as the I,~1~. is independent of pH (6.0--7.6). It was not possible to obtain K,, 1 values at lower pH values because of more pronounced inhibition by Br . As Fig. 2A suggests, the affinity for H:O 2 de-creases when the pH is decreased. Indeed. as shown in Fig. 3. the logarithm of the K,, of bromoperoxidase for H,O, .  obtained from Line-weaver-Burk plots of rates as a function of [HzO:]. increased linearly with pH. However, the V, .... was not affected by pH (3.7-6.0). Like the other bromoperoxidases, the enzyme was not inhibited by chloride up to 0.5 M (not shown). It has been known for a long time that some of these algal peroxidases are quite thermostable [11.15.21]. Fig. 4 shows that when the enzyme is kept at 50\u00b0C. the brominating activity was not affected for a long period of time. At higher temperatures the enzyme was rapidly inactivated, but at 70\u00b0C 38% of the activity still remained after 1 h of incubation.

At variable time intervals, samples were taken and assayed for bromoperoxidase activity.

The thermostability of the en-zyme is also reflected in the effect of temperature on the initial rate of bromination.

As Fig. 5 shows, 30% (v/v) ethanol had little effect on the bromoperoxidase activity, whereas in the presence of 30% (v/v) methanol the activity decreased to 40% of its original value. Surprisingly, in 1-prop-anal an increase in the bromoperoxidase activity was found. A similar increase was observed when low concentrations of Tween-80, cholate or Triton X-100 were added to the reaction mixture (not shown). Discussion Our purified preparation of bromoperoxidase shows only one main protein band by SDS-gel electrophoresis which exhibited brominating activ-ity. Considering the amount of protein present in our preparation, the enzyme should show an ap-preciable absorption in the optical absorption spectrum attributable to a haemoprotein. This was not observed by Vilter [20] and ourselves, and this may suggest that the peroxidase activity is not derived from an enzyme containing a haem pros-thetic group. Others [14,16] apparently also came to this conclusion and have even considered the possibility that the bromoperoxidase is a fla-voprotein. However, it has been reported [14,18] that specific flavoprotein inhibitors had no effect on the activity. Recently it was demonstrated [20] that the peroxidase from A. nod\u2022sum could be inactivated by dialysis at low pH and that the activity was specifically restored by addition of vanadium(V). We were able to confirm this observation and studies are in progress to assess the amount of vanadium in the bromoperoxidase. Also the lack of inhibition of the brominating activity by azide or cyanide suggests that this peroxidase is not a haemoprotein. As in other haloperoxidases [27-29] the steady-state kinetics of the peroxidation of Br-catalysed by the bromoperoxidase is rather com-plex. Like other haloperoxidases [27-30], the en-zyme shows pH optima in the activity, which demonstrates that protonation steps are involved in the catalytic cycle. In myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase [27,30], the K m measured for H2 0 2 increased with decreasing pH. In bromoperoxidase this is also found and this suggests that at low pH 186 an inhibitory protonated complex is formed in line with the decrease in activity at low pH values. This inhibition is not due to irreversible denaturatiofi. When the enzyme was incubated at pH 4.0 and the activity was measured at neutral pH, the same activity was found as before incubation at low pH. Our gel-chromatography experiment on Sephacryl S-200 indicates that the molecular mass of bromoperoxidase is greater than 250000. It is con-ceivable that the enzyme is aggregated under these conditions, but it is also possible that the enzyme is tightly bound to alginate, a polysaccharide which is present in these algae [31]. This alginate is probably also responsible for the high viscosity found in the supernatants after extraction of the seaweed. Similar association of the peroxidase with polysaccharides has been observed with per-oxidases from the red alga B. hamifera [14] and the brown alga L. digitata [18]. In line with Ref. 12, we have observed that bromoperoxidase is not inhibited by chloride and that chloride is not used as an electron donor. Considering the radius of chloride and bromide and their hydration number [32], the former observation is rather surprising. From a chemical point of view one would expect that the smaller chloride ion would act as an inhibitor, since it is likely to be bound to the active site. How this is avoided is not clear, but it is physiologically understandable in view of the concentration in seawater of chloride and bromide [6], 500 mM and 1 mM, respectively.

These vary from the iodinated thyroid hormones [1] in mammals to toxic fluorinated fatty acids produced by certain plants [2].

        "In particular, algae produce a fascinating diver-sity of extraordinary compounds, including hetero-geneous dihalide derivatives [6]. All these products show considerable antibacterial activity and may have a function against predation or act as mes-sengers in systems involved in chemical defence [6]. Although very likely, only in a few c.ases has it actually been demonstrated that peroxidases are involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites. The best studied haloperoxidase is that secreted by the fungus Caldariomyces fumago [7] and those present in red and green algae [6,8-14]. Some of the brown algae also contain peroxidase activity [15,16] and accumulate brominated compounds [17]. The peroxidases from Laminaria digitata [18] and Ascophyllum nodosum [19,20] have been partly purified and characterised. Most of the per-oxidases of marine origin are markedly thermosta-ble [11,15,21] and since these enzymes may be of potential value in the production of speciality chemicals or the biosynthesis of novel compounds of commercial interest [22], the reported thermo-stability may be of advantage.

The reaction mixture contained 100 mM KBr, 0.1 M potassium phos-phate (pH 6.5), 0.2 M Na2SO 4 and 50 ~M mono-chlorodimedone and the reaction was started by the addition of 2 mM H202. Na2SO 4 was present in the assay to avoid large changes in ionic strength due to variation of buffer ion concentration with pH. H202 solutions were prepared by dilution of a 30% stock solution of perhydrol (Merck, Darms-tadt, F.R.G.). The concentration of H202 was determined spectrophotometrical ly  with an absorption coefficient of 43.6 M l. c m  1 at 240 nm [24]. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et ai.

Spectro-photometric measurements were performed on a Cary-17 spectrophotometer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out with 10% gels as described by Maurer [26]. Standard proteins used for molecular weight determinations ranged in molecular weight from 20 000 to 94 000.",

The evidence that the peroxidases from the green alga Enteromorpha linza [10], and red alga Cystoclonium purpureum [8] are haemoproteins, is indirect, i.e., based mainly on the inhibition of the enzyme by cyanide and azide. Our purified enzyme preparation at a protein con-centration of 10 mg / m l  does not exhibit an ab-sorption peak in the Soret region of the optical spectrum. Also, the brominating activity of the enzyme was not inhibited by 1 mM azide, whereas 0.1 mM cyanide inhibited the reaction only tem-porarily. After a lag time which was dependent upon the cyanide concentration, bromination of monochiorodimedone reoccurred (not shown). Since it has been demonstrated in Ref. 13 that HOBr has a higher affinity for CN -than for monochlorodimedone and reacts with CN -to yield CNBr, this observation demonstrates that even when CN -does inhibit the enzymic activity of bromoperoxidase, the inhibition is incomplete and reversible.",

A similar increase was observed when low concentrations of Tween-80, cholate or Triton X-100 were added to the reaction mixture (not shown).",
        "Discussion",
        "Our purified preparation of bromoperoxidase shows only one main protein band by SDS-gel electrophoresis which exhibited brominating activ-ity. Considering the amount of protein present in our preparation, the enzyme should show an ap-preciable absorption in the optical absorption spectrum attributable to a haemoprotein. This was not observed by Vilter [20] and ourselves, and this may suggest that the peroxidase activity is not derived from an enzyme containing a haem pros-thetic group. Others [14,16] apparently also came to this conclusion and have even considered the possibility that the bromoperoxidase is a fla-voprotein. However, it has been reported [14,18] that specific flavoprotein inhibitors had no effect on the activity. Recently it was demonstrated [20] that the peroxidase from A. nod\u2022sum could be inactivated by dialysis at low pH and that the activity was specifically restored by addition of vanadium(V). We were able to confirm this observation and studies are in progress to assess the amount of vanadium in the bromoperoxidase. Also the lack of inhibition of the brominating activity by azide or cyanide suggests that this peroxidase is not a haemoprotein.",
        "As in other haloperoxidases [27-29] the steady-state kinetics of the peroxidation of Br-catalysed by the bromoperoxidase is rather com-plex. Like other haloperoxidases [27-30], the en-zyme shows pH optima in the activity, which demonstrates that protonation steps are involved in the catalytic cycle. In myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase [27,30], the K m measured for H2 0 2 increased with decreasing pH. In bromoperoxidase this is also found and this suggests that at low pH",
        "186",
        "an inhibitory protonated complex is formed in line with the decrease in activity at low pH values. This inhibition is not due to irreversible denaturatiofi. When the enzyme was incubated at pH 4.0 and the activity was measured at neutral pH, the same activity was found as before incubation at low pH. Our gel-chromatography experiment on Sephacryl S-200 indicates that the molecular mass of bromoperoxidase is greater than 250000. It is con-ceivable that the enzyme is aggregated under these conditions, but it is also possible that the enzyme is tightly bound to alginate, a polysaccharide which is present in these algae [31]. This alginate is probably also responsible for the high viscosity found in the supernatants after extraction of the seaweed. Similar association of the peroxidase with polysaccharides has been observed with per-oxidases from the red alga B. hamifera [14] and the brown alga L. digitata [18].",
        "In line with Ref. 12, we have observed that bromoperoxidase is not inhibited by chloride and that chloride is not used as an electron donor. Considering the radius of chloride and bromide and their hydration number [32], the former observation is rather surprising. From a chemical point of view one would expect that the smaller chloride ion would act as an inhibitor, since it is likely to be bound to the active site. How this is avoided is not clear, but it is physiologically understandable in view of the concentration in seawater of chloride and bromide [6], 500 mM and 1 mM, respectively.",
