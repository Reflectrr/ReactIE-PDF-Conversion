Despite much effort and major prog-ress, it remains an unsolved problem1,2. Biosynthetic sequences, by contrast, provide many spectacular examples of late aliphatic C-H bond functionalization3\u20139. Enzymes that employ (i) a free-radical or high-valent metal-oxo intermediate to abstract hydrogen (H ) from an aliphatic carbon; (ii) a substrate binding site that permits only the C-H target and not other, more reactive functional groups to approach the reactive intermediate; and (iii) allosterically controlled timing of intermediate formation achieve a degree of specificity and control not yet replicated in chemical systems6,7. However, biological C-H functionalization would, in light of current knowledge, seem to have its own limitations. Whereas enzymatic couplings of carbon10, oxygen3\u20135,11, phosphorus12, sulfur13 and halogen atoms14\u201316 to aliphatic carbon centers are known, examples of the installa-tion of nitrogenous functional groups have not been forthcoming. Indeed, although there have been recent reports of an intramolecular amination of a benzylic carbon in an elegantly engineered, unnat-ural substrate and the nitration of an aromatic carbon by cyto-chrome P450 enzymes17, enzymatic C-N coupling at a completely unactivated aliphatic carbon center is unknown. In this reaction type, the development of synthetic methods has, ironically, out-stripped the discovery or development of enzymatic activities18,19. It remains unclear whether such reactions do not exist in nature or simply remain to be discovered.The iron(II)-and \u03b1-ketoglutarate\u2013dependent (Fe/\u03b1KG) hydrox-ylases and halogenases have similar structures and share a com-mon initial mechanism for aliphatic C-H activation3\u20135,11. In each reaction, an Fe(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate, which forms from the Fe(II) cofactor, O2, and two electrons derived from oxidative decar-boxylation of \u03b1KG to succinate (Fig. 1a), abstracts H\u2022 from the substrate to form a carbon-centered radical and Fe(III)-OH form of the cofactor (Fig. 1b)3\u20135,11,20. The reactions diverge according to the fate of this intermediate (Fig. 1b). In the hydroxylases, the substrate radical couples with the OH ligand (termed \u2018oxygen rebound\u201921), thereby returning the cofactor to its resting +2 oxidation state. In the halogenases, the substrate radical instead couples with a halogen ligand coordinated cis to the OH ligand, presumably converting the cofactor to an Fe(II)-OH form15,16,22\u201324. The halogen that is ultimately transferred to the substrate initially coordinates to the Fe(II) cofac-tor as free chloride or bromide at a position that is occupied in the hydroxylases by a carboxylate ligand from an aspartate residue22,25 (Fig. 1a). The controlling structural distinction is thus the replace-ment of the protein-donated carboxylate ligand in the hydroxylases by a noncoordinating alanine in the halogenases to open the site for coordination of halide22 in preparation for O2-driven ferryl formation15,16,23 and ferryl-mediated radical group transfer24,25.For the halogenase SyrB2 from the syringomycin biosynthetic pathway of Pseudomonas syringae B301D25,26, the basis for selective coupling of the substrate carbon radical with the cis halogen rather than the hydroxyl ligand is the positioning of the C-H target of the substrate away from the oxo or hydroxo ligand and closer to the halogen, which effectively sacrifices proficiency in the initial H\u2022 abstraction for selectivity in the subsequent group transfer step24. Modifications to the native substrate (the C4 amino acid, L-threonine, appended to the carrier protein, SyrB1(Thr-S-SyrB1)25; Fig. 1c) anticipated to permit closer approach of the side chain methyl target to the oxygen ligand (for example, lengthening of the alkyl side chain) are associated with marked acceleration of an otherwise sluggish H\u2022 abstraction step and a marked increase in competing hydroxylation. The substrate with the C5 amino acid, L-norvaline (Nva), appended to SyrB1 (Nva-S-SyrB1) supports 130-fold faster H\u2022 abstraction and undergoes primarily hydroxylation at C5. Computational studies have provided structural rationales for the positioning effect27 and suggested that the different target positions result in the engagement of different frontier orbitals in the H\u2022 abstraction step, which in turn sets the stage for different group transfer outcomes28,29. SyrB2 thus has two crucial features that enable its halogenation outcome: substrate and cofactor binding 1Department of chemistry, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USa. 2Department of Biochemistry and molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USa. 3Present addresses: Department of chemical Physiology, The Scripps research Institute, la Jolla, california, USa (m.l.m.); Department of medicine, memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer center, New York, New York, USa (l.a.m.). *e-mail: matthews@scripps.edu or jmb21@psu.edudirect nitration and azidation of aliphatic carbons by an iron-dependent halogenaseMegan L Matthews1,3*, Wei-chen Chang1, andrew p Layne1, Linde a Miles2,3, Carsten Krebs1,2 & J Martin Bollinger Jr1,2*Iron-dependent halogenases employ cis-halo-Fe(IV)-oxo (haloferryl) complexes to functionalize unactivated aliphatic carbon centers, a capability elusive to synthetic chemists. Halogenation requires (i) coordination of a halide anion (Cl-or Br-) to the enzyme\u2019s Fe(II) cofactor, (ii) coupled activation of O2 and decarboxylation of a-ketoglutarate to generate the haloferryl inter-mediate, (iii) abstraction of hydrogen (H\u2022) from the substrate by the ferryl and (iv) transfer of the cis halogen as Cl\u2022 or Br\u2022 to the substrate radical. This enzymatic solution to an unsolved chemical challenge is potentially generalizable to installation of other functional groups, provided that the corresponding anions can support the four requisite steps. We show here that the wild-type halogenase SyrB2 can indeed direct aliphatic nitration and azidation reactions by the same chemical logic. The discovery and enhancement by mutagenesis of these previously unknown reaction types suggest unrecognized or untapped versatility in ferryl-mediated enzymatic C-H bond activation. \u2022 np g \u00a9  201 4 N at ur e A m er ic a,  Inc.

We considered that these features might confer capabilities for ferryl-mediated radical group transfer reactions beyond the known halogenation and hydroxylation outcomes, including, perhaps, installation of nitrogenous functional groups.reSulTS Demonstration of azidation and nitration productsAnalysis by LC/MS of SyrB2 reactions carried out in the presence of the anions N3-and NO2-revealed that the wild-type halogenase can indeed mediate unprecedented azidation and nitration reactions upon a completely unactivated aliphatic carbon (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1). We selected L-2-aminobutyrate (Aba; Fig. 2) appended to SyrB1 (Aba-S-SyrB1) as the ideal substrate for this analysis for two reasons. First, we anticipated that it would provide the optimal balance between proficiency in the H\u2022 abstrac-tion step, which varies in the order Thr-S-SyrB1 < Aba-S-SyrB1 < Nva-S-SyrB1, and propensity of the substrate radical to couple with the cis ligand rather than the HO\u2022, which varies in the oppo-site order24 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Second, we could more easily obtain standards for the expected 4-NO2-Aba (1) and 4-N3-Aba (2) products (Online Methods) than for the corresponding deriva-tives of the native Thr-S-SyrB1 substrate. We used remotely deuterium-labeled Aba (3,3-[2H2]-Aba or 3-d2-Aba) to prepare the Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate (giving 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1) so that MS signa-tures of the enzymatic products would be shifted by +2 units and the standard compounds of natural isotopic abundance could be used as LC/MS internal standards. We also analyzed control reactions lacking \u03b1KG (\u2013\u03b1KG) to distinguish peaks associated with authentic prod-ucts of the SyrB2 reaction from those associated with other reaction components and contaminants. The addition of the unlabeled Aba standard permitted quantification of the 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate that was consumed in the complete reactions (+\u03b1KG) (Fig. 2a,b). Single-ion monitoring (SIM) LC/MS chromatograms revealed a diminished intensity of the peak for the 3-d2-Aba released from the substrate relative to that of the unlabeled Aba standard, indicating that the substrate was indeed consumed in the complete reactions. This substrate depletion was associated with formation of products having the m/z values expected for the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba ([M+H]+ = 151.1) and 4-N3-3-d2-Aba ([M+H]+ = 147.1) products (Fig. 2a\u2013d). The peaks for these products had the same LC elution times as the authentic 4-NO2-Aba and 4-N3-Aba standards detected in the m/z = 149.1 and m/z =145.1 SIM chromatograms. Their proper m/z values, co-elution with authentic standards and absence from the chromatograms of the \u2013\u03b1KG control samples strongly suggested that the peaks arose from the desired nitration and azidation products. These assignments were confirmed by both SIM chromato-grams (Fig. 2c,d) and MS/MS fragmentation chromatograms (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b) of samples prepared with isotopically labeled anions. In the reaction with NO2-, the use of Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate prepared with unlabeled Aba resulted in a product with the same m/z as the standard, and, consequently, no peak was seen at m/z = 151.1 corresponding to the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba product (Fig. 2c). The chromatograms from this reaction exposed a peak from a contaminant eluting just ahead of 4-NO2-Aba and having the same m/z (152.1) as 4-15NO2-3-d2-Aba. The contaminant peak could thus be properly accounted for in the actual experiment. The corresponding MS/MS chromatograms (Supplementary Fig. 1a) were free from this contaminant, owing to the specificity of the frag-mentation used for detection. Use of the 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate gave a peak at the proper mass and elution time for 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba (Fig. 2c), as also shown in Figure 2a. The abolition of this peak upon use of 15NO2-(98% isotopic enrichment) in place of the natu-ral isotopic abundance anion and the appearance of the expected +1 peak (m/z = 152.1) eluting just after and largely resolved from the peak of the contaminant (Fig. 2c) confirmed the attachment of the nitrogenous anion to the Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate, an unprecedented C-N coupling reaction. Analogously, in the N3-reaction, the use of unlabeled Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate and the anion with natural isotopic abundance resulted in 4-N3-Aba product (2) indistinguishable from the standard, and no peak for 4-N3-3-d2-Aba was seen (Fig. 2d). Use of the 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate and natural abundance N3-resulted in the expected peak at m/z = 147.1 (Fig. 2b). Replacement of the anion by 15N14N2-(98% isotopic enrichment) eliminated this peak and gave rise to the expected +1 peak, which was absent from the reaction with natural isotopic abundance N3-(Fig. 2d). These data confirmed the enzymatic coupling also of N3-to Aba-S-SyrB1. Nitration and azidation at the C4 methyl (rather than C3 methylene) of the appended Aba was implied both by co-elution of the enzymatic NO2-and N3-Aba products with the 4-modified standards and, more definitively, by the m/z value of the product: attachment at C3 of 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 would have given a product with m/z = 150.1, rather than 151.1, as a result of the loss of 2H from C3, rather than 1H from C4, in the C-H activation step.yields of the nitration and azidation productsWe estimated the yields of the C-N coupling products from the LC/MS SIM and LC/MS/MS fragmentation chromatograms (Online Methods). The relative areas of the peaks for deuterium-labeled products and unlabeled standards in Figure 2a,b and Supplementary Figure 1 afforded estimates of the absolute concen-trations of the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba and 4-N3-3-d2-Aba products recov-ered in the small-molecule fractions after extended incubation to OH R1 R1 = OH R1 Y X = Asp/Glu (hydroxylases)Y = Cl\u2013/Br\u2013 (halogenases)His Fe(II) O O X/H2O His O R2 H2O H2N H2O H2O His Fe(II) O O X/Y His O R2 R1 H R1 Fe(IV) OH O R2 R1 = targeted aliphatic carbon of the substrateR2 = (CH2)2CO2\u2013 (cosubstrate)X/Y His His O His O R2X/Y His O R1 OH His O R2 His O His Fe(II) Fe(II) O R2X His O Y\u2013 R1 H Binding O2 CO2 R1 His Fe(IV) Fe(III) OH O R2X/Y His O Activation a b c SyrB1 O P O HO HN HN O O O O\u2013 S O OH Figure 1 | related mechanistic logic of the Fe/aKg halogenases and hydroxylases.

(c) Structure of the native SyrB2 substrate, Thr-S-SyrB1.

Comparison of the areas of the peaks for the 3-d2-Aba recovered from the carrier protein in the complete reaction and \u2013\u03b1KG control samples to the area of the peak for the unlabeled Aba internal stan-dard afforded estimates of both the quantity of 3-d2-Aba recovered in the workup in the absence of any substrate consumption (\u2013\u03b1KG) and the quantity consumed in the complete reaction (+\u03b1KG). From these values, we obtained yields of 5 \u00b1 2% of the total Aba and 8 \u00b1 2% of the Aba consumed (values represent mean and s.d. from three trials) for the nitration reaction; the corresponding azidation yields were 1 \u00b1 0.4% and 4 \u00b1 2% (four trials), respectively. We consider the yields relative to the consumed substrate to be the more relevant metric because unprocessed substrate presumably remains available for conversion in additional turnovers. Consistent with the reason-ing from our previous study24, Aba-S-SyrB1 seemed to be more effi-ciently nitrated than either Thr-S-SyrB1 or Nva-S-SyrB1, although these other two substrates did also yield detectable quantities of C-N coupling products (Supplementary Fig. 3).anion triggering of halo-, nitrito-and azido-ferryl formationTo establish that the new aliphatic nitration and azidation reactions proceed by the expected ferryl-mediated radical group transfer mechanism, we interrogated the requisite steps in the mechanism (steps i\u2013iv in Abstract) individually. After observing a visible color change upon addition of Cl-to a solution of the SyrB2\u2013Fe(II)\u2013\u03b1KG complex, we discovered that binding of the native anion could be monitored directly by a shift in the Fe(II)\u2192\u03b1KG metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band at ~500 nm (Fig. 3a), which is a well-established hallmark of enzymes in this class3,30. Similar per-turbations caused by addition of various non-native anions (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4) demonstrated both the versatility of the anion-binding site and the robustness of this previously unknown spectral perturbation for assessing anion binding. Binding of the nitrogenous anions N3-and NO2-could also readily be monitored by this assay (Fig. 3b), although the spectral change associated with addition of NO2-was quite different from those associated with the other anions, owing in part to its intrinsic UV absorption31.  + \u03b1KG\u2013 \u03b1KGFe(II)\u2013SyrB2\u2013d 2 -Aba-S-SyrB1 + NO2 \u2013 + O2 9 \u00d7 1046 \u00d7 1043 \u00d7 1046 \u00d7 1053 \u00d7 1050 10 12 Time (min)0 a 6 \u00d7 1044 \u00d7 1042 \u00d7 10410 12 Time (min)c d2-Aba, 15NO2 \u2013 d2-Aba, NO2\u2013 Aba, NO2\u2013 In te ns ity 9 \u00d7 1046 \u00d7 1043 \u00d7 104b  10 12 Time (min)6 \u00d7 1053 \u00d7 1050 Intensity+ \u03b1KG\u2013 \u03b1KG9 10 Time (min)11 d 6 \u00d7 1044 \u00d7 1042 \u00d7 104Fe(II)\u2013SyrB2\u2013d 2 -Aba-S-SyrB1 + N3 \u2013 + O2 d2-Aba, 15NN2 \u2013 d2-Aba, N3\u2013 Aba, N3\u2013 NH3 O OH O2N NH3 O OH D D O2N NH3 O OH D D NH3 O OH NH3 O OH D D O215N NH3 O OH O2N NH3 O OH D D O2N +3 +2 NH3 O OH D D 14N215N NH3 O OH N3 NH3 O OH D D N3 +3 +2 + + NH3 O OH N3 + + + + + + + NH3 O OH D D N3 + NH3 O OH D D + NH3 O OH + + + Intensity In te ns ity In te ns ity In te ns ity Figure 2 | lC/mS analysis demonstrating the new C-N coupling reactions catalyzed by SyrB2.

The apparent rank order of affinities for the anions that caused a measureable shift in the MLCT band was Cl-> NO2-> CN-~N3-~OCN-> Br-~HS-> HCO2-(there was no evidence for binding of SCN-, CH3S-, I-, NO3-or F-; data not shown), but the KD values for the competent anions spanned only a factor of approximately ten (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 1). The anion site was thus found to be quite tolerant of differences in shape, steric bulk and electronic structure.By interrogating the O2 reactivity of the SyrB2 complex with its aminoacyl-SyrB1 substrate in the absence or presence of an added anion, we discovered an important but previously unrecognized functional feature of the halogenase: binding of the anion profoundly activates the enzyme and its Fe(II) cofactor for reaction with O2, just as binding of the aminoacyl carrier protein substrate was previously shown to \u2018trigger\u2019 formation of the key ferryl intermediate16. In the reaction with either the native, chlorination-predominant Thr-S-SyrB1 substrate or the hydroxylation-predominant Nva-S-SyrB1 substrate, development of the UV absorption and M\u00f6ssbauer quadrupole doublet features of the chloroferryl complex was impeded or eliminated in reac-tions from which Cl-was omitted and was restored upon addition of the native anion (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 6\u20138). The small, faster phase in the Abs320 kinetic trace of the Thr-S-SyrB1 reaction lacking added anion (Fig. 4a) suggested the presence of contaminating Cl-despite extensive dialysis intended to remove it, a deduction consistent with our detection by LC/MS of chlorinated products even in reactions to which Cl-was not inten-tionally added (described below). Difficulty in removing Cl-has been reported in other studies on aliphatic halogenases25.

Among the non-native anions, N3-was the most effective, and NO2-was the least effective. For each of the non-native anions, M\u00f6ssbauer quadrupole doublet features consistent with the accumulation of one or more Fe(IV) complexes could be observed in freeze-quenched samples of the reaction triggered by the anion (Supplementary Fig. 6)23. These observations established that installation of the nitrogenous anions proceeds by the same mechanism as the native haloge-nation reaction. They further established anion triggering of O2 activation as a control mechanism employed by SyrB2 in its native function. The differential triggering of O2 activation by different anions hints at the possibility of engineering the enzyme not only for improved binding selectivity for a given non-native anion but also for improved triggering efficacy by that anion, which could potentially provide an additional tool for enhancing efficiency of new group transfer outcomes.rational improvement of C-N coupling efficiencyThe ability to install nitrogenous functional groups, in particular the azido group, onto aliphatic carbon centers could enable new meth-ods in the field of chemical biology. Indeed, the so-called \u2018click\u2019 and Staudinger ligation reactions, already widely used in the field, rely on the unique and \u2018bioorthogonal\u2019 reactivity of the azido group32\u201334. Development of an azidation catalyst useful for in vivo  applications would be facilitated by improvement upon the modest yields observed here and might require modification of the enzyme to cope with the relatively high concentrations of Cl-in biological milieu35. Unlike the native Cl-, neither N3-nor NO2-is spherical, and each could potentially experience steric clashes within a pocket evolved to bind Cl-selectively. We reasoned that substitutions opening space in the anion-binding site of SyrB2 might, therefore, improve the enzyme as a catalyst for C-N coupling reactions by diminishing affinity for the native Cl-, attenuating the thermodynamic discrimi-nation against binding of the complex anions, perturbing the relative triggering efficacies of the native and non-native anions, permitting binding in a geometry more favorable for radical group transfer or some combination of these four effects. The A118G substitution effectively replaces a methyl group in this pocket by hydrogen. This substitution resulted in ~1,000-fold diminution in the affinity for the native Cl-without noticeably affecting the affinity for N3-(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). In addition, anion triggering of O2 addition was retained in the A118G variant protein (Fig. 4a). Trials comparing intensities of LC/MS/MS peaks from reaction products generated by the wild-type and variant enzymes under identical reaction conditions showed that, indeed, the quantities of both C-N coupling products were invariably greater with the A118G variant (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), and so the extent of enhance-ment associated with the substitution and impact of the substitution on the ability of added Cl-to suppress the C-N coupling outcomes were accurately assessed in an isotopic ratio experiment (Fig. 5). In this experiment, the products from the wild-type and A118G variant enzymes were distinguished by use of the isotopologic anions 14NO2-or 14N3-with the wild-type enzyme and 15NO2-or 15N14N2-with the A118G variant. After being allowed to proceed to completion, the reaction samples were combined and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Under the conditions examined (in a single trial), the A118G substitution was found to enhance the yield of nitration by ~2.5-fold (Fig. 5a) and the yield of azidation by ~13-fold (Fig. 5b) in the absence of added Cl-. An azidation yield of greater than 20% of the 3-d2-Aba consumed was estimated for this experiment. For the more efficient nitration reaction, yields as high as 52 \u00b1 8% of the 3-d2-Aba consumed (22 \u00b1 4% of the initial 3-d2-Aba present) were observed (values represent the mean and range of two experiments in Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, nitration by the A118G variant protein was more robust to suppression by Cl-than nitration by the wild-type enzyme. In the isotopic ratio experiment, the level of contaminating Cl-was suffi-cient to support chlorination in competition with nitration (Fig. 5c), and the peak intensities implied similar yields of the two products under these conditions (Fig. 5a,c). In the presence of one equivalent (with respect to SyrB2) of additional Cl-, nitration by the wild-type enzyme was almost completely suppressed, whereas nitration by the A118G variant still proceeded to a detectable extent (Fig. 5a). Thus, under these conditions, the variant SyrB2 was more efficient than the wild-type enzyme by ~30-fold. The azidation reaction was observed to be intrinsically more robust to Cl-suppression than the nitration reaction, even in the wild-type enzyme. With just the contaminat-ing Cl-present, chlorination was undetectable in the presence of the 2.5 equivalents (per SyrB2) of N3-that was added in the reaction (Fig. 5c). In the presence of one equivalent of additional Cl-along with the N3-, chlorination was detected (Fig. 5c), but the yield of Figure 5 | enhanced efficiency of C-N coupling in the a118g variant of SyrB2. (a\u2013c) The lc/mS/mS chromatograms monitor collision-induced transitions associated with the nitration (a), azidation (b) and chlorination (c) products formed in the reactions of the wild-type (WT) and a118G variant SyrB2. In a and b, reactions of the wild-type protein in the presence of the natural-abundance anion and the a118G variant protein in the presence of 15No2-or 15N14N2-were combined and co-injected. Purple and orange show reactions containing no added cl-; green and gray show reactions containing 1 equivalent per SyrB2 (or SyrB2a118G) added cl-. comparison of the orange and purple traces in a illustrates that the nitration yield of the a118G variant is ~2.5-fold greater than the yield of the wild-type enzyme in the absence of added cl-; comparison of the gray and green traces implies a ~30-fold greater nitration yield for the a118G variant in the presence of 1 equivalent of added cl-. cross comparisons of the orange and gray or purple and green traces illustrate the ability of added cl-to suppress the nitration reaction in both wild-type SyrB2 and the a118G variant. comparison of the orange and purple traces in b illustrates that the azidation yield of the a118G variant is ~13-fold greater than yield of the wild-type enzyme in the absence of added cl-. comparisons of the orange and gray or purple and green traces illustrate the inability of 1 equivalent of added cl-to suppress the azidation reaction in either wild-type or a118G variant SyrB2. Shown in c are chromatograms for the chlorination product showing that addition of cl-(green) enhances the chlorination yields in both the reaction with No2-(left) and the reaction with N3-(right) compared to the corresponding reactions without added cl-(purple).c NO2 \u2013 In te ns ity Intensity 6 \u00d7 1034 \u00d7 1032 \u00d7 103Time (min)129 0 Time (min)129 0 6 \u00d7 1032 \u00d7 1034 \u00d7 103N3 \u2013 a 3 \u00d7 1022 \u00d7 102In te ns ity 1 \u00d7 1020 10 Time (min)1211 + Cl\u2013\u2013 Cl\u2013WT (14N)A118G (15N)1 2.5 0.01 0.3 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba b In te ns ity 1 \u00d7 1025 \u00d7 1010 Time (min)129 + Cl\u2013\u2013 Cl\u2013WT (14N)A118G (15N)1 13 1.2 10 4-N3-3-d2-Aba + Cl\u2013\u2013 Cl\u2013NO2 \u2013 N3 \u2013 0.12 0 1 0.33 4-Cl-3-d2-Aba np g \u00a9  201 4 N at ur e A m er ic a,  Inc.

A recently reported nitration of an aromatic carbon mediated by a cytochrome P450 bears some resemblance to the SyrB2-mediated nitration reaction36, but the aromatic nitration almost certainly does not proceed by initial C-H cleavage, as group transfers to aliphatic carbons must. Similarly, C-N coupling by a streptavidin-based artificial Pd-containing metalloenzyme targets an olefinic carbon37, a chemically less challenging transformation. A recently reported intramolecular amination of a benzylic carbon by an engineered cytochrome P450 on an unnatural substrate hav-ing an adjacent photo-reactive aryl azide functionality to generate an iron-nitrenoid intermediate is perhaps more closely related, but it also does not target a completely unactivated aliphatic C-H bond in the presence of inherently more reactive targets, as the SyrB2 reactions do17. Likewise, the several new chemical strategies for coupling nitrogen to aliphatic carbon centers (for example, amina-tions) that have recently been developed38\u201341 have certain inherent limitations. In some cases, the outcomes are intramolecular cou-plings directed by proximity engineered into the substrates39\u201341. In others, the C-H target is partially activated38\u201340. Most importantly, the intimate involvement of the nitrogen atom in the C-H\u2013cleaving iron-nitrenoid intermediates initiating all of these reactions limits their potential scope.The strategy used by SyrB2 in its native halogenation and now nitration and azidation reactions has different limitations. First, all of the halogenases discovered to date require a carrier-protein appended substrate (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2a). This requirement limits the substrate scope to amino acids that the corresponding charging (\u2018adenylation\u2019) function, which in SyrB1 resides in the N terminus of the same polypeptide, will append to the phosphopantetheine cofactor of the carrier protein or domain. However, our previous work showed that SyrB1 is, fortuitously, rela-tively promiscuous and will self-charge multiple amino acids with diverse side chains16. Moreover, the two other aminoacyl-SyrB1 substrates (Thr-S-SyrB1 and Nva-S-SyrB1) in the series of three that was used to establish the dominant role of substrate positioning in controlling the reaction outcome24 are also both detectably nitrated. This observation implies that, whereas proper substrate positioning is important also for the nitration outcome, the requirement is not so stringent as to limit the scope of the reaction to a single substrate. Moreover, modification of adenylation modules for altered amino acid specificity has been achieved42,43 and could further expand the substrate scope. Finally, there is no a priori reason that the mecha-nistic strategy could not be extended to small-molecule substrates (in either natural or engineered enzymes), a possibility that we con-tinue to explore. The second limitation of the reactions in their cur-rent forms is the modest yields. Here, the ability of a single, rationally chosen substitution to enhance the binding specificity of the desired anion, augment the yields of both reactions and confer robustness to suppression by the native anion bodes well for the potential to evolve Fe/\u03b1KG oxygenases for such alternative outcomes.Despite their present limitations, the new C-N coupling reac-tions extend an enzymatic strategy for functionalization of unacti-vated carbon centers that is fundamentally distinct from the other chemical and enzymatic precedents and is, at least potentially, more versatile. Given that the requisite initiating H\u2022 abstraction is delegated to the common oxo ligand of the ferryl intermedi-ates, the scope of cis-coordinated anionic ligands that might con-ceivably be coupled is broad. Although we have not yet detected products resulting from the transfer of other nonhalide ligands, the promiscuous binding and triggering of O2 activation by differ-ent anions and the robustness of ferryl formation in their presence (Supplementary Fig. 6) suggest that other reactions will be pos-sible. Moreover, all of the demonstrated and envisaged couplings are intermolecular and expected to be exquisitely controlled by the active site architecture. Indeed, it is precisely this absolute chemo-, regio-and stereospecificity that can be accomplished by enzymes by virtue of their complex substrate binding sites that has made their use in synthetic chemistry seductive and, more recently, prac-tically important44,45. These considerations provide the impetus for ongoing efforts to develop and discover enzymatic catalysts for aliphatic C-N coupling reactions. received 13 July 2013; accepted 10 December 2013; published online 26 January 2014meTHODS Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper.references 1.

Sodium azide (NaN3) was purchased from EMD Chemicals, Inc. (Gibbstown, NJ). Potassium cyanate (KOCN) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). Sodium nitrate (NaNO3) was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). (2S)-2-Amino-4-azido-butanoic acid (4-N3-Aba) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Product List (North York, Canada). All of the other chemicals (except for 4-NO2-Aba, which was synthe-sized as summarized below) were obtained from sources previously noted16,24. Purchased reagents were used as received without purification.General synthetic methods. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 360 MHz spectrometers. Chemical shifts are reported in p.p.m. using a residual solvent peak as an internal standard. J values are reported in Hz.Synthesis of 4-NO2-Aba. 4-NO2-Aba was synthesized as previously reported46. Lithium diisopropylamide (3.5 mL of 0.5 M solution in THF, 1.75 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of N-diphenylmethyleneglycine t-butyl ester (500 mg, 1.7 mmol) in THF (5 mL) at \u201378 \u00b0C, and the solution was stirred for 1.5 h. Nitroethylene (3.4 mL of 0.5 M solution in THF, 1.7 mmol) was then added to the reaction solution at the same temperature. After stirring for 1 h, the reaction mixture was gradually brought to room temperature and quenched by addition of water (20 mL) followed by ethyl acetate (20 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated under vaccum. The product was purified by silica gel chromatography using hexanes/ethyl acetate (4:1) as an eluent to obtain the pure product in 40% yield. The 1H-NMR spec-trum of the t-butyl 2-diphenylmethyleneimino-4-nitrobutanoate was identical to that reported in the literature46. Global deprotection was carried out by add-ing 1 N HCl (5 mL) to the t-butyl 2-diphenylmethyleneimino-4-nitrobutanoate (37 mg, 0.1 mmol) and stirring at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl ether (3 \u00d7 5 mL), and the aqueous layer was subjected to lyophilization to obtain the final product. 1H-NMR: (360 MHz, D2O) \u03b4 4.03 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 2H), 2.39-2.49 (m, 3H) (Supplementary Fig. 12).Protein purification and substrate assembly. These steps were performed as previously described16.Anion titrations and analysis to extract dissociation constants. Analogously to published titrations of SyrB2 with Fe(II)47, a concentrated, buffered, O2-free stock of the relevant anion was added in small aliquots to an O2-free solution of the SyrB2\u2013Fe(II)\u2013\u03b1KG complex or  SyrB2A118\u2013Fe(II)\u2013\u03b1KG complex contain-ing 0.75 mM Fe(II), 5 mM \u03b1KG and 1 mM SyrB2 or SyrB2A118G. Spectra were acquired after each addition until the absorption spectrum stopped changing (after several min).Stopped-flow absorption experiments. The kinetics of formation and decay of the ferryl intermediate at 5 \u00b0C were monitored by its absorbance at 320 nm (\u0394Abs320). An O2-saturated buffer solution (20 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) was mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with an equal volume of an O2-free solution containing 0.4 mM SyrB2 (or SyrB2A118G), 0.3 mM Fe(II), 10 mM \u03b1KG and 0.9 mM of the aminoacyl-SyrB1 substrate. The anion concentrations in the experiment of Figure 4 were 50 mM Cl-(Fig. 4a) and 0.2 mM N3-or 1 mM NO2-(Fig. 4b). The reactant concentrations in the experiments depicted in Supplementary Figures 7 and 9 were equivalent. Solely to clarify presenta-tion of the stopped-flow data, the Steineman smoothing function supplied as a standard feature of the Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) analysis software was applied to all of the kinetic traces.Preparation of M\u00f6ssbauer samples and spectral analysis. Unless otherwise noted, the final concentrations for all M\u00f6ssbauer samples in Supplementary Figures 6 and 8 were: [57Fe] ~0.4 mM, [SyrB2] ~0.5 mM, [aminoacyl-S-SyrB1] ~0.8 mM, [\u03b1KG] = 5 mM, [NaCl] = 50 mM, [NaCN/NaNO2/Na2S] = 1 mM and [N3-] = 0.4 mM. Using regression analysis, 4.2-K/zero-field spectra of the reactant SyrB2\u2013Fe(II)\u2013\u03b1KG\u2013Y-\u2013aminoacyl-S-SyrB1 complexes were analyzed assuming one or two symmetrical quadrupole doublets. The fits returned parameters typical of high-spin Fe(II) complexes. Spectra of samples that were reacted with O2 exhibited features with parameters typical of high-spin Fe(IV), which were assigned to the Y\u2013Fe(IV)=O intermediates, and features from an unreacted high-spin Fe(II) complex (or complexes). The high-energy lines of the quadrupole doublets assigned to Fe(IV) and Fe(II) were well resolved, but the associated low-energy lines were unresolved. To overcome this lack of resolution and determine the M\u00f6ssbauer parameters of the Fe(IV) complexes, we analyzed experimental spectra of freeze-quenched samples in one of three ways. First, we subtracted the appropriate contribution of the experimental spectrum of the corresponding Fe(II)-containing reactant complex, as judged by comparison of the intensity of the resolved high-energy lines. This subtrac-tion produced \u2018reference spectra\u2019 for the Fe(IV) complexes that were of variable quality but yielded acceptable results when the shape of the high-energy line of the Fe(II) component matched well with that from the Fe(II) reactant complex or if the contribution from Fe(II) in the spectrum of the freeze-quenched sam-ple was small. The second method for generation of Fe(IV) reference spectra involved modeling the spectral contribution of the Fe(II) complexes as quadru-pole doublets with parameters (isomer shift (\u03b4), quadrupole splitting (\u0394EQ) and line width (\u0393)) obtained from fitting of the spectra of the reactant complexes, but in varying proportions. The third method for generation of the Fe(IV) ref-erence spectra was identical to the second method, except that the line widths of the Fe(II) quadrupole doublets were allowed to vary within 10% of the value obtained from fitting of the Fe(II) reference spectrum. The Fe(IV) reference spectra were then simulated as a single quadrupole doublet, except for that of the chloroferryl intermediate in the presence of either Thr-S-SyrB1 (ref. 16) or d5-Nva-S-SyrB1, for which the high-energy line of the Fe(IV) reveals two par-tially resolved peaks, indicating the presence of two ferryl complexes, as pre-viously reported15,16. The spectra of the presumed nitritoferryl (O2N\u2013Fe(IV) = O) and (hydro)sulfidoferryl ((H)S\u2013Fe(IV) = O) complexes with d5-Thr-S-SyrB1 were rather sharp, and the positions of the low-energy lines of the vari-ous reference spectra were well determined. The azidoferryl (N3\u2013Fe(IV)=O) intermediate formed with d5-Thr-S-SyrB1 accumulated in high yield, and the lines were nearly symmetrical but broad. The spectrum of the cyanidofer-ryl (CN\u2013Fe(IV)=O) complex was the least well resolved, owing to its lesser accumulation, differences between the Fe(II) components in the reactant and freeze-quenched samples and the breadth of the lines in the Fe(IV) reference spectrum. From these analyses, we estimated the uncertainties in the values for the M\u00f6ssbauer parameters to be 0.05 mm/s for the isomer shifts and 0.10 mm/s for the quadrupole splitting parameters. These error estimates are conserva-tive: they represent the upper limits of the observed variations in the extracted parameters for the different methods of analysis.C-N coupling reactions and analysis by LC/MS. Reactions associated with Figure 2 were performed as follows. Aba-S-SyrB1 and 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 were prepared by incubation of 3.0 mM HS-SyrB1, 5.0 mM Aba or 3-d2-Aba, 30 mM ATP and 30 mM MgSO4 for 30 min at room temperature. Prior to their use in the SyrB2 reactions, assembled substrates were purified from small molecules as previously described24. The final concentrations in the SyrB2 reactions were 0.2 mM Fe(II), 0.2 mM SyrB2, 0.8 mM Y-, 0.12 mM \u03b1KG and 0.1 mM desalted Aba-S-SyrB1 or 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1. L-Glycine, an amino acid that SyrB1 can-not append to its carrier domain, was added to 10 \u03bcM as an internal standard. Overnight incubation at ambient temperature allowed the SyrB2 reaction to proceed to completion and allowed the thioester-linked amino acid substrates and products to be hydrolyzed from the phosphopantetheine cofactor. The amino acids were then purified from the free SyrB1 and SyrB2 proteins via pas-sage through a Microcon centrifugal filter unit with a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Millipore). In the control reactions lacking \u03b1KG, the typical recovery of 3-d2-Aba in this procedure was ~50%. Prior to LC/MS analysis, 25 \u03bcM Aba, 2.5 \u03bcM 4-NO2-Aba and/or 2.5 \u03bcM 4-N3-Aba were added to the filtrate, as appro-priate. The concentrations of standards were chosen such that their measured peak areas were comparable to those for corresponding reaction products.Reactions associated with Figure 5 were performed essentially as described above, with the following exceptions. After the reaction of the wild-type and A118G variant SyrB2 were allowed to reach completion, equal volumes of the two solutions were mixed. C-N coupling products generated by each enzyme could be distinguished by using isotopologic anions. Unlabeled 14NO2-or 14N3-was used with the wild-type enzyme and isotopically enriched 15NO2-or 15N14N2-was used with the A118G variant, necessarily associating 4-N3-and 4-NO2-d2-Aba products with the reaction of the wild-type enzyme and 4-15N14N2-and 4-15NO2-d2-Aba products with the reaction of the A118G variant. The concentrations of reactants were 0.25 mM Fe(II), 0.25 mM SyrB2, np g \u00a9  201 4 N at ur e A m er ic a,  Inc.

In this case, the 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate was prepared by incubation of 0.19 mM HS-SyrB1, 0.15 mM 3-d2-Aba, 2.3 mM ATP and 2.3 mM MgSO4 for 30 min at ambient temperature and was used in the SyrB2 reactions without desalting.The LC was performed on a ZIC-HILIC column (Merck-Millipore). The mobile phase was a mixture of 95:5 (v/v) H2O:CH3CN (A) and 95:5 (v/v) CH3CN:H2O (B), of which both were supplemented with 0.1% formic acid to facilitate ionization. Following sample injection (10 \u03bcL) under 95% B with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, the mobile phase was varied linearly to 80% B over the first 10 min, held constant for 5 min, changed to 0% B over the next 20 min, increased linearly to 95% B over the following 20 min and held con-stant at 95% B in preparation for the next injection. In the SIM chromatograms of Figure 2, parent amino acid cations were monitored. In the MS/MS frag-mentation chromatograms of Figure 5, the daughter iminium ions formed by neutral loss of CO2 and H2 (a combined mass of 46 a.m.u.) from the parent cations were selectively monitored (m/z values of the relevant transitions are in Supplementary Table 4). The fragmentation was detected by application of a collision energy of 3 V to the parent ion. The drying gas temperature was 350 \u00b0C with a nebulizer pressure of 40 psi and flow rate of 9 L/min. The cap-illary voltage was set to 4,000 V. The fragmentor voltage was set at 70 V to achieve maximal electrospray ionization for detection. Dwell times of 50 ms and 400 ms were dedicated to detection of each parent or parent-to-daughter cation transition, respectively.Estimation of the yields of the 4-NO2-Aba and 4-N3-Aba products. The fact that the initial amino acid products of the SyrB2 reaction are linked as thioester to SyrB1 creates the challenge of determining the combined yield of hydrolysis off the carrier protein and recovery in the workup. The immediate 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 or 4-N3-3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 products were not readily acces-sible either by synthesis or by enzymatic attachment of the synthetic amino acid products to the phosphopantetheine cofactor of the carrier domain by the adenylation domain (they seem not to be accepted for charging). Recovery of the 3-d2-Aba substrate off the SyrB1 carrier protein was assessed in a con-trol reaction from which \u03b1KG was omitted. In the control, comparison of the peak for the 3-d2-Aba released from SyrB1 to that for the unlabeled free Aba amended to the sample afforded absolute quantification of the released 3-d2-Aba and its fractional recovery (40\u201360% overall). Likewise, this same comparison for the reaction sample containing \u03b1KG permitted quantifica-tion of unreacted 3-d2-Aba recovered in the complete reaction. The difference between these concentrations gave the concentration of 3-d2-Aba consumed in the reaction. Comparison of the peak for the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba or 4-N3-3-d2-Aba amino acid to that for the synthetic, unlabeled 4-NO2-Aba and 4-N3-Aba standard amended to the reaction afforded absolute quantification of the recovered enzymatic product. By invoking the necessary assumption that the fractional recovery of the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba or 4-N3-3-d2-Aba amino acid from the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 or 4-N3-3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 primary product was identical to that determined for the unreacted 3-d2-Aba, the yield of the prod-uct with respect to either the 3-d2-Aba consumed or the total 3-d2-Aba initially present in the reaction was calculated. For example, in two typical nitration reactions under conditions optimized for this reaction with the A118G variant, we detected 11 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba (reaction volume of 0.10 mL) when the recovered 3-d2-Aba in the \u2013\u03b1KG-control reaction was 49 \u03bcM and the amount of 3-d2-Aba recovered in the complete reaction was 28 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM (values represent mean and range of two measurements). The 3-d2-Aba concentrations imply that ~21 \u03bcM substrate was consumed in the complete reaction. Dividing the 11 \u03bcM 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba produced by the 21 \u03bcM 3-d2-Aba consumed gives a nitration yield of ~52% of the 3-d2-Aba consumed. Alternatively, the ratio of the 11 \u03bcM 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba produced to the 49 \u03bcM recovered in the absence of any conversion gives a nitration yield of ~22% of the 3-d2-Aba initially present in the reaction.46.

        "10.1038/nCHeMBIO.1438The capacity to install functional groups onto aliphatic carbon centers late in synthetic sequences is considered a holy grail of synthetic chemistry. Despite much effort and major prog-ress, it remains an unsolved problem1,2. Biosynthetic sequences, by contrast, provide many spectacular examples of late aliphatic C-H bond functionalization3\u20139. Enzymes that employ (i) a free-radical or high-valent metal-oxo intermediate to abstract hydrogen (H ) from an aliphatic carbon; (ii) a substrate binding site that permits only the C-H target and not other, more reactive functional groups to approach the reactive intermediate; and (iii) allosterically controlled timing of intermediate formation achieve a degree of specificity and control not yet replicated in chemical systems6,7. However, biological C-H functionalization would, in light of current knowledge, seem to have its own limitations. Whereas enzymatic couplings of carbon10, oxygen3\u20135,11, phosphorus12, sulfur13 and halogen atoms14\u201316 to aliphatic carbon centers are known, examples of the installa-tion of nitrogenous functional groups have not been forthcoming. Indeed, although there have been recent reports of an intramolecular amination of a benzylic carbon in an elegantly engineered, unnat-ural substrate and the nitration of an aromatic carbon by cyto-chrome P450 enzymes17, enzymatic C-N coupling at a completely unactivated aliphatic carbon center is unknown. In this reaction type, the development of synthetic methods has, ironically, out-stripped the discovery or development of enzymatic activities18,19. It remains unclear whether such reactions do not exist in nature or simply remain to be",
        "discovered.The iron(II)-and \u03b1-ketoglutarate\u2013dependent (Fe/\u03b1KG) hydrox-ylases and halogenases have similar structures and share a com-mon initial mechanism for aliphatic C-H activation3\u20135,11. In each reaction, an Fe(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate, which forms from the Fe(II) cofactor, O2, and two electrons derived from oxidative decar-boxylation of \u03b1KG to succinate (Fig. 1a), abstracts H\u2022 from the substrate to form a carbon-centered radical and Fe(III)-OH form of the cofactor (Fig. 1b)3\u20135,11,20. The reactions diverge according to the fate of this intermediate (Fig. 1b). In the hydroxylases, the substrate radical couples with the OH ligand (termed \u2018oxygen rebound\u201921), thereby returning the cofactor to its resting +2 oxidation state. In the halogenases, the substrate radical instead couples with a halogen ligand coordinated cis to the OH ligand, presumably converting the cofactor to an Fe(II)-OH form15,16,22\u201324. The halogen that is ultimately transferred to the substrate initially coordinates to the Fe(II) cofac-tor as free chloride or bromide at a position that is occupied in the hydroxylases by a carboxylate ligand from an aspartate residue22,25 (Fig. 1a). The controlling structural distinction is thus the replace-ment of the protein-donated carboxylate ligand in the hydroxylases by a noncoordinating alanine in the halogenases to open the site for coordination of halide22 in preparation for O2-driven ferryl formation15,16,23 and ferryl-mediated radical group",
        "transfer24,25.For the halogenase SyrB2 from the syringomycin biosynthetic pathway of Pseudomonas syringae B301D25,26, the basis for selective coupling of the substrate carbon radical with the cis halogen rather than the hydroxyl ligand is the positioning of the C-H target of the substrate away from the oxo or hydroxo ligand and closer to the halogen, which effectively sacrifices proficiency in the initial H\u2022 abstraction for selectivity in the subsequent group transfer step24. Modifications to the native substrate (the C4 amino acid, L-threonine, appended to the carrier protein, SyrB1(Thr-S-SyrB1)25; Fig. 1c) anticipated to permit closer approach of the side chain methyl target to the oxygen ligand (for example, lengthening of the alkyl side chain) are associated with marked acceleration of an otherwise sluggish H\u2022 abstraction step and a marked increase in competing hydroxylation. The substrate with the C5 amino acid, L-norvaline (Nva), appended to SyrB1 (Nva-S-SyrB1) supports 130-fold faster H\u2022 abstraction and undergoes primarily hydroxylation at C5. Computational studies have provided structural rationales for the positioning effect27 and suggested that the different target positions result in the engagement of different frontier orbitals in the H\u2022 abstraction step, which in turn sets the stage for different group transfer outcomes28,29. SyrB2 thus has two crucial features that enable its halogenation outcome: substrate and cofactor binding",

        "Jr1,2*Iron-dependent halogenases employ cis-halo-Fe(IV)-oxo (haloferryl) complexes to functionalize unactivated aliphatic carbon centers, a capability elusive to synthetic chemists. Halogenation requires (i) coordination of a halide anion (Cl-or Br-) to the enzyme\u2019s Fe(II) cofactor, (ii) coupled activation of O2 and decarboxylation of a-ketoglutarate to generate the haloferryl inter-mediate, (iii) abstraction of hydrogen (H\u2022) from the substrate by the ferryl and (iv) transfer of the cis halogen as Cl\u2022 or Br\u2022 to the substrate radical. This enzymatic solution to an unsolved chemical challenge is potentially generalizable to installation of other functional groups, provided that the corresponding anions can support the four requisite steps. We show here that the wild-type halogenase SyrB2 can indeed direct aliphatic nitration and azidation reactions by the same chemical logic. The discovery and enhancement by mutagenesis of these previously unknown reaction types suggest unrecognized or untapped versatility in ferryl-mediated enzymatic C-H bond activation.",

        "groups.reSulTS Demonstration of azidation and nitration productsAnalysis by LC/MS of SyrB2 reactions carried out in the presence of the anions N3-and NO2-revealed that the wild-type halogenase can indeed mediate unprecedented azidation and nitration reactions upon a completely unactivated aliphatic carbon (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1). We selected L-2-aminobutyrate (Aba; Fig. 2) appended to SyrB1 (Aba-S-SyrB1) as the ideal substrate for this analysis for two reasons. First, we anticipated that it would provide the optimal balance between proficiency in the H\u2022 abstrac-tion step, which varies in the order Thr-S-SyrB1 < Aba-S-SyrB1 < Nva-S-SyrB1, and propensity of the substrate radical to couple with the cis ligand rather than the HO\u2022, which varies in the oppo-site order24 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Second, we could more easily obtain standards for the expected 4-NO2-Aba (1) and 4-N3-Aba (2) products (Online Methods) than for the corresponding deriva-tives of the native Thr-S-SyrB1 substrate. We used remotely deuterium-labeled Aba (3,3-[2H2]-Aba or 3-d2-Aba) to prepare the Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate (giving 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1) so that MS signa-tures of the enzymatic products would be shifted by +2 units and the standard compounds of natural isotopic abundance could be used as LC/MS internal standards. We also analyzed control reactions lacking \u03b1KG (\u2013\u03b1KG) to distinguish peaks associated with authentic prod-ucts of the SyrB2 reaction from those associated with other reaction components and contaminants. The addition of the unlabeled Aba standard permitted quantification of the 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate that was consumed in the complete reactions (+\u03b1KG) (Fig. 2a,b). Single-ion monitoring (SIM) LC/MS chromatograms revealed a diminished intensity of the peak for the 3-d2-Aba released from the substrate relative to that of the unlabeled Aba standard, indicating that the substrate was indeed consumed in the complete reactions. This substrate depletion was associated with formation of products having the m/z values expected for the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba ([M+H]+ = 151.1) and 4-N3-3-d2-Aba ([M+H]+ = 147.1) products (Fig. 2a\u2013d). The peaks for these products had the same LC elution times as the authentic 4-NO2-Aba and 4-N3-Aba standards detected in the m/z = 149.1 and m/z =145.1 SIM chromatograms. Their proper m/z values, co-elution with authentic standards and absence from the chromatograms of the \u2013\u03b1KG control samples strongly suggested that the peaks arose from the desired nitration and azidation products.",
        "These assignments were confirmed by both SIM chromato-grams (Fig. 2c,d) and MS/MS fragmentation chromatograms (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b) of samples prepared with isotopically labeled anions. In the reaction with NO2-, the use of Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate prepared with unlabeled Aba resulted in a product with the same m/z as the standard, and, consequently, no peak was seen at m/z = 151.1 corresponding to the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba product (Fig. 2c). The chromatograms from this reaction exposed a peak from a contaminant eluting just ahead of 4-NO2-Aba and having the same m/z (152.1) as 4-15NO2-3-d2-Aba. The contaminant peak could thus be properly accounted for in the actual experiment. The corresponding MS/MS chromatograms (Supplementary Fig. 1a) were free from this contaminant, owing to the specificity of the frag-mentation used for detection. Use of the 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate gave a peak at the proper mass and elution time for 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba (Fig. 2c), as also shown in Figure 2a. The abolition of this peak upon use of 15NO2-(98% isotopic enrichment) in place of the natu-ral isotopic abundance anion and the appearance of the expected +1 peak (m/z = 152.1) eluting just after and largely resolved from the peak of the contaminant (Fig. 2c) confirmed the attachment of the nitrogenous anion to the Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate, an unprecedented C-N coupling reaction. Analogously, in the N3-reaction, the use of unlabeled Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate and the anion with natural isotopic abundance resulted in 4-N3-Aba product (2) indistinguishable from the standard, and no peak for 4-N3-3-d2-Aba was seen (Fig. 2d). Use of the 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 substrate and natural abundance N3-resulted in the expected peak at m/z = 147.1 (Fig. 2b). Replacement of the anion by 15N14N2-(98% isotopic enrichment) eliminated this peak and gave rise to the expected +1 peak, which was absent from the reaction with natural isotopic abundance N3-(Fig. 2d). These data confirmed the enzymatic coupling also of N3-to Aba-S-SyrB1. Nitration and azidation at the C4 methyl (rather than C3 methylene) of the appended Aba was implied both by co-elution of the enzymatic NO2-and N3-Aba products with the 4-modified standards and, more definitively, by the m/z value of the product: attachment at C3 of 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 would have given a product with m/z = 150.1, rather than 151.1, as a result of the loss of 2H from C3, rather than 1H from C4, in the C-H activation",

        "10.1038/nCHeMBIO.1438allow for their release from SyrB1 by hydrolysis of the thioester link-age. Comparison of the areas of the peaks for the 3-d2-Aba recovered from the carrier protein in the complete reaction and \u2013\u03b1KG control samples to the area of the peak for the unlabeled Aba internal stan-dard afforded estimates of both the quantity of 3-d2-Aba recovered in the workup in the absence of any substrate consumption (\u2013\u03b1KG) and the quantity consumed in the complete reaction (+\u03b1KG). From these values, we obtained yields of 5 \u00b1 2% of the total Aba and 8 \u00b1 2% of the Aba consumed (values represent mean and s.d. from three trials) for the nitration reaction; the corresponding azidation yields were 1 \u00b1 0.4% and 4 \u00b1 2% (four trials), respectively. We consider the yields relative to the consumed substrate to be the more relevant metric because unprocessed substrate presumably remains available for conversion in additional turnovers. Consistent with the reason-ing from our previous study24, Aba-S-SyrB1 seemed to be more effi-ciently nitrated than either Thr-S-SyrB1 or Nva-S-SyrB1, although these other two substrates did also yield detectable quantities of C-N coupling products (Supplementary Fig. 3).anion triggering of halo-, nitrito-and azido-ferryl formationTo establish that the new aliphatic nitration and azidation reactions proceed by the expected ferryl-mediated radical group transfer mechanism, we interrogated the requisite steps in the mechanism (steps i\u2013iv in Abstract) individually. After observing a visible color change upon addition of Cl-to a solution of the SyrB2\u2013Fe(II)\u2013\u03b1KG complex, we discovered that binding of the native anion could be monitored directly by a shift in the Fe(II)\u2192\u03b1KG metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band at ~500 nm (Fig. 3a), which is a well-established hallmark of enzymes in this class3,30. Similar per-turbations caused by addition of various non-native anions (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4) demonstrated both the versatility of the anion-binding site and the robustness of this previously unknown spectral perturbation for assessing anion binding. Binding of the nitrogenous anions N3-and NO2-could also readily be monitored by this assay (Fig. 3b), although the spectral change associated with addition of NO2-was quite different from those associated with the other anions, owing in part to its intrinsic UV absorption31.",

The apparent rank order of affinities for the anions that caused a measureable shift in the MLCT band was Cl-> NO2-> CN-~N3-~OCN-> Br-~HS-> HCO2-(there was no evidence for binding of SCN-, CH3S-, I-, NO3-or F-; data not shown), but the KD values for the competent anions spanned only a factor of approximately ten (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 1).

        "structure.By interrogating the O2 reactivity of the SyrB2 complex with its aminoacyl-SyrB1 substrate in the absence or presence of an added anion, we discovered an important but previously unrecognized functional feature of the halogenase: binding of the anion profoundly activates the enzyme and its Fe(II) cofactor for reaction with O2, just as binding of the aminoacyl carrier protein substrate was previously shown to \u2018trigger\u2019 formation of the key ferryl intermediate16. In the reaction with either the native, chlorination-predominant Thr-S-SyrB1 substrate or the hydroxylation-predominant Nva-S-SyrB1 substrate, development of the UV absorption and M\u00f6ssbauer quadrupole doublet features of the chloroferryl complex was impeded or eliminated in reac-tions from which Cl-was omitted and was restored upon addition of the native anion (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 6\u20138). The small, faster phase in the Abs320 kinetic trace of the Thr-S-SyrB1 reaction lacking added anion (Fig. 4a) suggested the presence of contaminating Cl-despite extensive dialysis intended to remove it, a deduction consistent with our detection by LC/MS of chlorinated products even in reactions to which Cl-was not inten-tionally added (described below). Difficulty in removing Cl-has been reported in other studies on aliphatic halogenases25.

        "10.1038/nCHeMBIO.1438albeit with varying efficacy. Among the non-native anions, N3-was the most effective, and NO2-was the least effective. For each of the non-native anions, M\u00f6ssbauer quadrupole doublet features consistent with the accumulation of one or more Fe(IV) complexes could be observed in freeze-quenched samples of the reaction triggered by the anion (Supplementary Fig. 6)23. These observations established that installation of the nitrogenous anions proceeds by the same mechanism as the native haloge-nation reaction. They further established anion triggering of O2 activation as a control mechanism employed by SyrB2 in its native function. The differential triggering of O2 activation by different anions hints at the possibility of engineering the enzyme not only for improved binding selectivity for a given non-native anion but also for improved triggering efficacy by that anion, which could potentially provide an additional tool for enhancing efficiency of new group transfer",
        "outcomes.rational improvement of C-N coupling efficiencyThe ability to install nitrogenous functional groups, in particular the azido group, onto aliphatic carbon centers could enable new meth-ods in the field of chemical biology. Indeed, the so-called \u2018click\u2019 and Staudinger ligation reactions, already widely used in the field, rely on the unique and \u2018bioorthogonal\u2019 reactivity of the azido group32\u201334. Development of an azidation catalyst useful for in vivo  applications would be facilitated by improvement upon the modest yields observed here and might require modification of the enzyme to cope with the relatively high concentrations of Cl-in biological milieu35. Unlike the native Cl-, neither N3-nor NO2-is spherical, and each could potentially experience steric clashes within a pocket evolved to bind Cl-selectively. We reasoned that substitutions opening space in the anion-binding site of SyrB2 might, therefore, improve the enzyme as a catalyst for C-N coupling reactions by diminishing affinity for the native Cl-, attenuating the thermodynamic discrimi-nation against binding of the complex anions, perturbing the relative triggering efficacies of the native and non-native anions, permitting binding in a geometry more favorable for radical group transfer or some combination of these four effects. The A118G substitution effectively replaces a methyl group in this pocket by hydrogen. This substitution resulted in ~1,000-fold diminution in the affinity for the native Cl-without noticeably affecting the affinity for N3-(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). In addition, anion triggering of O2 addition was retained in the A118G variant protein (Fig. 4a).",
        "Trials comparing intensities of LC/MS/MS peaks from reaction products generated by the wild-type and variant enzymes under identical reaction conditions showed that, indeed, the quantities of both C-N coupling products were invariably greater with the A118G variant (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), and so the extent of enhance-ment associated with the substitution and impact of the substitution on the ability of added Cl-to suppress the C-N coupling outcomes were accurately assessed in an isotopic ratio experiment (Fig. 5). In this experiment, the products from the wild-type and A118G variant enzymes were distinguished by use of the isotopologic anions 14NO2-or 14N3-with the wild-type enzyme and 15NO2-or 15N14N2-with the A118G variant. After being allowed to proceed to completion, the reaction samples were combined and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Under the conditions examined (in a single trial), the A118G substitution was found to enhance the yield of nitration by ~2.5-fold (Fig. 5a) and the yield of azidation by ~13-fold (Fig. 5b) in the absence of added Cl-. An azidation yield of greater than 20% of the 3-d2-Aba consumed was estimated for this experiment. For the more efficient nitration reaction, yields as high as 52 \u00b1 8% of the 3-d2-Aba consumed (22 \u00b1 4% of the initial 3-d2-Aba present) were observed (values represent the mean and range of two experiments in Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, nitration by the A118G variant protein was more robust to suppression by Cl-than nitration by the wild-type enzyme. In the isotopic ratio experiment, the level of contaminating Cl-was suffi-cient to support chlorination in competition with nitration (Fig. 5c), and the peak intensities implied similar yields of the two products under these conditions (Fig. 5a,c). In the presence of one equivalent (with respect to SyrB2) of additional Cl-, nitration by the wild-type enzyme was almost completely suppressed, whereas nitration by the A118G variant still proceeded to a detectable extent (Fig. 5a). Thus, under these conditions, the variant SyrB2 was more efficient than the wild-type enzyme by ~30-fold. The azidation reaction was observed to be intrinsically more robust to Cl-suppression than the nitration reaction, even in the wild-type enzyme. With just the contaminat-ing Cl-present, chlorination was undetectable in the presence of the 2.5 equivalents (per SyrB2) of N3-that was added in the reaction (Fig. 5c). In the presence of one equivalent of additional Cl-along with the N3-, chlorination was detected (Fig. 5c), but the yield of",

In a and b, reactions of the wild-type protein in the presence of the natural-abundance anion and the a118G variant protein in the presence of 15No2-or 15N14N2-were combined and co-injected.

        "10.1038/nCHeMBIO.1438the azidation product was not detectably diminished for either the wild-type or variant SyrB2 (Fig.",
        "5b).DISCuSSION To assess the virtues and limitations of the newly demonstrated reactions, it is relevant first to compare the mechanistic strategy used by SyrB2 to those of other known enzymatic and chemical C-N coupling reactions. A recently reported nitration of an aromatic carbon mediated by a cytochrome P450 bears some resemblance to the SyrB2-mediated nitration reaction36, but the aromatic nitration almost certainly does not proceed by initial C-H cleavage, as group transfers to aliphatic carbons must. Similarly, C-N coupling by a streptavidin-based artificial Pd-containing metalloenzyme targets an olefinic carbon37, a chemically less challenging transformation. A recently reported intramolecular amination of a benzylic carbon by an engineered cytochrome P450 on an unnatural substrate hav-ing an adjacent photo-reactive aryl azide functionality to generate an iron-nitrenoid intermediate is perhaps more closely related, but it also does not target a completely unactivated aliphatic C-H bond in the presence of inherently more reactive targets, as the SyrB2 reactions do17. Likewise, the several new chemical strategies for coupling nitrogen to aliphatic carbon centers (for example, amina-tions) that have recently been developed38\u201341 have certain inherent limitations. In some cases, the outcomes are intramolecular cou-plings directed by proximity engineered into the substrates39\u201341. In others, the C-H target is partially activated38\u201340. Most importantly, the intimate involvement of the nitrogen atom in the C-H\u2013cleaving iron-nitrenoid intermediates initiating all of these reactions limits their potential",
        "scope.The strategy used by SyrB2 in its native halogenation and now nitration and azidation reactions has different limitations. First, all of the halogenases discovered to date require a carrier-protein appended substrate (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2a). This requirement limits the substrate scope to amino acids that the corresponding charging (\u2018adenylation\u2019) function, which in SyrB1 resides in the N terminus of the same polypeptide, will append to the phosphopantetheine cofactor of the carrier protein or domain. However, our previous work showed that SyrB1 is, fortuitously, rela-tively promiscuous and will self-charge multiple amino acids with diverse side chains16. Moreover, the two other aminoacyl-SyrB1 substrates (Thr-S-SyrB1 and Nva-S-SyrB1) in the series of three that was used to establish the dominant role of substrate positioning in controlling the reaction outcome24 are also both detectably nitrated. This observation implies that, whereas proper substrate positioning is important also for the nitration outcome, the requirement is not so stringent as to limit the scope of the reaction to a single substrate. Moreover, modification of adenylation modules for altered amino acid specificity has been achieved42,43 and could further expand the substrate scope. Finally, there is no a priori reason that the mecha-nistic strategy could not be extended to small-molecule substrates (in either natural or engineered enzymes), a possibility that we con-tinue to explore. The second limitation of the reactions in their cur-rent forms is the modest yields. Here, the ability of a single, rationally chosen substitution to enhance the binding specificity of the desired anion, augment the yields of both reactions and confer robustness to suppression by the native anion bodes well for the potential to evolve Fe/\u03b1KG oxygenases for such alternative",
        "outcomes.Despite their present limitations, the new C-N coupling reac-tions extend an enzymatic strategy for functionalization of unacti-vated carbon centers that is fundamentally distinct from the other chemical and enzymatic precedents and is, at least potentially, more versatile. Given that the requisite initiating H\u2022 abstraction is delegated to the common oxo ligand of the ferryl intermedi-ates, the scope of cis-coordinated anionic ligands that might con-ceivably be coupled is broad. Although we have not yet detected products resulting from the transfer of other nonhalide ligands, the promiscuous binding and triggering of O2 activation by differ-ent anions and the robustness of ferryl formation in their presence (Supplementary Fig. 6) suggest that other reactions will be pos-sible. Moreover, all of the demonstrated and envisaged couplings are intermolecular and expected to be exquisitely controlled by the active site architecture. Indeed, it is precisely this absolute chemo-, regio-and stereospecificity that can be accomplished by enzymes by virtue of their complex substrate binding sites that has made their use in synthetic chemistry seductive and, more recently, prac-tically important44,45. These considerations provide the impetus for ongoing efforts to develop and discover enzymatic catalysts for aliphatic C-N coupling reactions.",

Sodium azide (NaN3) was purchased from EMD Chemicals, Inc. (Gibbstown, NJ). Potassium cyanate (KOCN) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). Sodium nitrate (NaNO3) was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). (2S)-2-Amino-4-azido-butanoic acid (4-N3-Aba) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Product List (North York, Canada). All of the other chemicals (except for 4-NO2-Aba, which was synthe-sized as summarized below) were obtained from sources previously noted16,24. Purchased reagents were used as received without purification.General synthetic methods. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 360 MHz spectrometers. Chemical shifts are reported in p.p.m. using a residual solvent peak as an internal standard. J values are reported in Hz.Synthesis of 4-NO2-Aba. 4-NO2-Aba was synthesized as previously reported46. Lithium diisopropylamide (3.5 mL of 0.5 M solution in THF, 1.75 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of N-diphenylmethyleneglycine t-butyl ester (500 mg, 1.7 mmol) in THF (5 mL) at \u201378 \u00b0C, and the solution was stirred for 1.5 h. Nitroethylene (3.4 mL of 0.5 M solution in THF, 1.7 mmol) was then added to the reaction solution at the same temperature. After stirring for 1 h, the reaction mixture was gradually brought to room temperature and quenched by addition of water (20 mL) followed by ethyl acetate (20 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated under vaccum. The product was purified by silica gel chromatography using hexanes/ethyl acetate (4:1) as an eluent to obtain the pure product in 40% yield. The 1H-NMR spec-trum of the t-butyl 2-diphenylmethyleneimino-4-nitrobutanoate was identical to that reported in the literature46. Global deprotection was carried out by add-ing 1 N HCl (5 mL) to the t-butyl 2-diphenylmethyleneimino-4-nitrobutanoate (37 mg, 0.1 mmol) and stirring at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl ether (3 \u00d7 5 mL), and the aqueous layer was subjected to lyophilization to obtain the final product. 1H-NMR: (360 MHz, D2O) \u03b4 4.03 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 2H), 2.39-2.49 (m, 3H) (Supplementary Fig. 12).Protein purification and substrate assembly. These steps were performed as previously described16.Anion titrations and analysis to extract dissociation constants. Analogously to published titrations of SyrB2 with Fe(II)47, a concentrated, buffered, O2-free stock of the relevant anion was added in small aliquots to an O2-free solution of the SyrB2\u2013Fe(II)\u2013\u03b1KG complex or  SyrB2A118\u2013Fe(II)\u2013\u03b1KG complex contain-ing 0.75 mM Fe(II), 5 mM \u03b1KG and 1 mM SyrB2 or SyrB2A118G. Spectra were acquired after each addition until the absorption spectrum stopped changing (after several min).Stopped-flow absorption experiments. The kinetics of formation and decay of the ferryl intermediate at 5 \u00b0C were monitored by its absorbance at 320 nm (\u0394Abs320). An O2-saturated buffer solution (20 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) was mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with an equal volume of an O2-free solution containing 0.4 mM SyrB2 (or SyrB2A118G), 0.3 mM Fe(II), 10 mM \u03b1KG and 0.9 mM of the aminoacyl-SyrB1 substrate. The anion concentrations in the experiment of Figure 4 were 50 mM Cl-(Fig. 4a) and 0.2 mM N3-or 1 mM NO2-(Fig. 4b). The reactant concentrations in the experiments depicted in Supplementary Figures 7 and 9 were equivalent. Solely to clarify presenta-tion of the stopped-flow data, the Steineman smoothing function supplied as a standard feature of the Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) analysis software was applied to all of the kinetic traces.Preparation of M\u00f6ssbauer samples and spectral analysis. Unless otherwise noted, the final concentrations for all M\u00f6ssbauer samples in Supplementary Figures 6 and 8 were: [57Fe] ~0.4 mM, [SyrB2] ~0.5 mM, [aminoacyl-S-SyrB1] ~0.8 mM, [\u03b1KG] = 5 mM, [NaCl] = 50 mM, [NaCN/NaNO2/Na2S] = 1 mM and [N3-] = 0.4 mM. Using regression analysis, 4.2-K/zero-field spectra of the reactant SyrB2\u2013Fe(II)\u2013\u03b1KG\u2013Y-\u2013aminoacyl-S-SyrB1 complexes were analyzed assuming one or two symmetrical quadrupole doublets. The fits returned parameters typical of high-spin Fe(II) complexes. Spectra of samples that were reacted with O2 exhibited features with parameters typical of high-spin Fe(IV), which were assigned to the Y\u2013Fe(IV)=O intermediates, and features from an unreacted high-spin Fe(II) complex (or complexes). The high-energy lines of the quadrupole doublets assigned to Fe(IV) and Fe(II) were well resolved, but the associated low-energy lines were unresolved. To overcome this lack of resolution and determine the M\u00f6ssbauer parameters of the Fe(IV) complexes, we analyzed experimental spectra of freeze-quenched samples in one of three ways. First, we subtracted the appropriate contribution of the experimental spectrum of the corresponding Fe(II)-containing reactant complex, as judged by comparison of the intensity of the resolved high-energy lines. This subtrac-tion produced \u2018reference spectra\u2019 for the Fe(IV) complexes that were of variable quality but yielded acceptable results when the shape of the high-energy line of the Fe(II) component matched well with that from the Fe(II) reactant complex or if the contribution from Fe(II) in the spectrum of the freeze-quenched sam-ple was small. The second method for generation of Fe(IV) reference spectra involved modeling the spectral contribution of the Fe(II) complexes as quadru-pole doublets with parameters (isomer shift (\u03b4), quadrupole splitting (\u0394EQ) and line width (\u0393)) obtained from fitting of the spectra of the reactant complexes, but in varying proportions. The third method for generation of the Fe(IV) ref-erence spectra was identical to the second method, except that the line widths of the Fe(II) quadrupole doublets were allowed to vary within 10% of the value obtained from fitting of the Fe(II) reference spectrum. The Fe(IV) reference spectra were then simulated as a single quadrupole doublet, except for that of the chloroferryl intermediate in the presence of either Thr-S-SyrB1 (ref. 16) or d5-Nva-S-SyrB1, for which the high-energy line of the Fe(IV) reveals two par-tially resolved peaks, indicating the presence of two ferryl complexes, as pre-viously reported15,16. The spectra of the presumed nitritoferryl (O2N\u2013Fe(IV) = O) and (hydro)sulfidoferryl ((H)S\u2013Fe(IV) = O) complexes with d5-Thr-S-SyrB1 were rather sharp, and the positions of the low-energy lines of the vari-ous reference spectra were well determined. The azidoferryl (N3\u2013Fe(IV)=O) intermediate formed with d5-Thr-S-SyrB1 accumulated in high yield, and the lines were nearly symmetrical but broad. The spectrum of the cyanidofer-ryl (CN\u2013Fe(IV)=O) complex was the least well resolved, owing to its lesser accumulation, differences between the Fe(II) components in the reactant and freeze-quenched samples and the breadth of the lines in the Fe(IV) reference spectrum. From these analyses, we estimated the uncertainties in the values for the M\u00f6ssbauer parameters to be 0.05 mm/s for the isomer shifts and 0.10 mm/s for the quadrupole splitting parameters. These error estimates are conserva-tive: they represent the upper limits of the observed variations in the extracted parameters for the different methods of analysis.C-N coupling reactions and analysis by LC/MS. Reactions associated with Figure 2 were performed as follows. Aba-S-SyrB1 and 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 were prepared by incubation of 3.0 mM HS-SyrB1, 5.0 mM Aba or 3-d2-Aba, 30 mM ATP and 30 mM MgSO4 for 30 min at room temperature. Prior to their use in the SyrB2 reactions, assembled substrates were purified from small molecules as previously described24. The final concentrations in the SyrB2 reactions were 0.2 mM Fe(II), 0.2 mM SyrB2, 0.8 mM Y-, 0.12 mM \u03b1KG and 0.1 mM desalted Aba-S-SyrB1 or 3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1. L-Glycine, an amino acid that SyrB1 can-not append to its carrier domain, was added to 10 \u03bcM as an internal standard. Overnight incubation at ambient temperature allowed the SyrB2 reaction to proceed to completion and allowed the thioester-linked amino acid substrates and products to be hydrolyzed from the phosphopantetheine cofactor. The amino acids were then purified from the free SyrB1 and SyrB2 proteins via pas-sage through a Microcon centrifugal filter unit with a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Millipore). In the control reactions lacking \u03b1KG, the typical recovery of 3-d2-Aba in this procedure was ~50%. Prior to LC/MS analysis, 25 \u03bcM Aba, 2.5 \u03bcM 4-NO2-Aba and/or 2.5 \u03bcM 4-N3-Aba were added to the filtrate, as appro-priate. The concentrations of standards were chosen such that their measured peak areas were comparable to those for corresponding reaction",
        "products.Reactions associated with Figure 5 were performed essentially as described above, with the following exceptions. After the reaction of the wild-type and A118G variant SyrB2 were allowed to reach completion, equal volumes of the two solutions were mixed. C-N coupling products generated by each enzyme could be distinguished by using isotopologic anions. Unlabeled 14NO2-or 14N3-was used with the wild-type enzyme and isotopically enriched 15NO2-or 15N14N2-was used with the A118G variant, necessarily associating 4-N3-and 4-NO2-d2-Aba products with the reaction of the wild-type enzyme and 4-15N14N2-and 4-15NO2-d2-Aba products with the reaction of the A118G variant. The concentrations of reactants were 0.25 mM Fe(II), 0.25 mM SyrB2,",

        "desalting.The LC was performed on a ZIC-HILIC column (Merck-Millipore). The mobile phase was a mixture of 95:5 (v/v) H2O:CH3CN (A) and 95:5 (v/v) CH3CN:H2O (B), of which both were supplemented with 0.1% formic acid to facilitate ionization. Following sample injection (10 \u03bcL) under 95% B with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, the mobile phase was varied linearly to 80% B over the first 10 min, held constant for 5 min, changed to 0% B over the next 20 min, increased linearly to 95% B over the following 20 min and held con-stant at 95% B in preparation for the next injection. In the SIM chromatograms of Figure 2, parent amino acid cations were monitored. In the MS/MS frag-mentation chromatograms of Figure 5, the daughter iminium ions formed by neutral loss of CO2 and H2 (a combined mass of 46 a.m.u.) from the parent cations were selectively monitored (m/z values of the relevant transitions are in Supplementary Table 4). The fragmentation was detected by application of a collision energy of 3 V to the parent ion. The drying gas temperature was 350 \u00b0C with a nebulizer pressure of 40 psi and flow rate of 9 L/min. The cap-illary voltage was set to 4,000 V. The fragmentor voltage was set at 70 V to achieve maximal electrospray ionization for detection. Dwell times of 50 ms and 400 ms were dedicated to detection of each parent or parent-to-daughter cation transition, respectively.Estimation of the yields of the 4-NO2-Aba and 4-N3-Aba products. The fact that the initial amino acid products of the SyrB2 reaction are linked as thioester to SyrB1 creates the challenge of determining the combined yield of hydrolysis off the carrier protein and recovery in the workup. The immediate 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 or 4-N3-3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 products were not readily acces-sible either by synthesis or by enzymatic attachment of the synthetic amino acid products to the phosphopantetheine cofactor of the carrier domain by the adenylation domain (they seem not to be accepted for charging). Recovery of the 3-d2-Aba substrate off the SyrB1 carrier protein was assessed in a con-trol reaction from which \u03b1KG was omitted. In the control, comparison of the peak for the 3-d2-Aba released from SyrB1 to that for the unlabeled free Aba amended to the sample afforded absolute quantification of the released 3-d2-Aba and its fractional recovery (40\u201360% overall). Likewise, this same comparison for the reaction sample containing \u03b1KG permitted quantifica-tion of unreacted 3-d2-Aba recovered in the complete reaction. The difference between these concentrations gave the concentration of 3-d2-Aba consumed in the reaction. Comparison of the peak for the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba or 4-N3-3-d2-Aba amino acid to that for the synthetic, unlabeled 4-NO2-Aba and 4-N3-Aba standard amended to the reaction afforded absolute quantification of the recovered enzymatic product. By invoking the necessary assumption that the fractional recovery of the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba or 4-N3-3-d2-Aba amino acid from the 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 or 4-N3-3-d2-Aba-S-SyrB1 primary product was identical to that determined for the unreacted 3-d2-Aba, the yield of the prod-uct with respect to either the 3-d2-Aba consumed or the total 3-d2-Aba initially present in the reaction was calculated. For example, in two typical nitration reactions under conditions optimized for this reaction with the A118G variant, we detected 11 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba (reaction volume of 0.10 mL) when the recovered 3-d2-Aba in the \u2013\u03b1KG-control reaction was 49 \u03bcM and the amount of 3-d2-Aba recovered in the complete reaction was 28 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM (values represent mean and range of two measurements). The 3-d2-Aba concentrations imply that ~21 \u03bcM substrate was consumed in the complete reaction. Dividing the 11 \u03bcM 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba produced by the 21 \u03bcM 3-d2-Aba consumed gives a nitration yield of ~52% of the 3-d2-Aba consumed. Alternatively, the ratio of the 11 \u03bcM 4-NO2-3-d2-Aba produced to the 49 \u03bcM recovered in the absence of any conversion gives a nitration yield of ~22% of the 3-d2-Aba initially present in the",
