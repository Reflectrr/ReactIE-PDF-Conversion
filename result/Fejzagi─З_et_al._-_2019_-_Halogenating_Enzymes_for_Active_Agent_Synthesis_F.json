However, the primary halogenating compound is molecular chlorine which has two major drawbacks, high energy consumption and hazardous handling. Nature bypassed molecular halogens and evolved at least six halogenating enzymes: Three kind of haloperoxidases, flavin-dependent halogenases as well as \u03b1-ketoglutarate and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent halogenases. This review shows what is known today on these enzymes in terms of biocatalytic usage. The reader may understand this review as a plea for the usage of halogenating enzymes for fine chemical syntheses, but there are many steps to take until halogenating enzymes are reliable, flexible, and sustainable catalysts for halogenation.

Still Up-to-Date\u2014Halogens in Active Agents For the discovery of new active agents, synthetic chemists frequently look into natural compounds and deduce lead structures and functionalities for the assembly of active agent libraries. Although most natural compounds are not halogenated, halogenation is spread over virtually all classes of secondary metabolites. Most of the halogenated natural compounds are of marine origin, while some are found in plants and insects as well [1]. Halogens appear in some form in 40% of all drugs being tested in clinical trials [2\u20134]. In addition to the fact that halogenations are an important structural motifs in natural substances and thus also in the resulting active substances, halogenations play a major role in the synthesis of many active substances. In the following, we want to figure out what is so special about the simple halogen moieties within molecules and reactions that make them so desirable, although the synthesis is very energy-demanding and carried out with toxic molecular halogens such as chlorine gas. In the second half of this review article we would like to show how nature realizes halogenations enzymatically and where we stand technologically to employ them as tools. In recent years, these enzymes have become even more prominent and the various scientific advances in this field have already been presented several times in an overview. These reviews also provide an up-to-date overview of the different enzymes, their substrate scope and biotechnological developments as well as the diversity of halo-compounds from all kingdoms of life [5\u201314]. The aim of this review is\u2014among other things\u2014to include a further point of view. In addition to the accurate arguments on the toxicity of elemental halogens and the cost-effectiveness of halide salts, a closer look at the actual costs of chlorine gas production was included, as well as a clear presentation that chemical halogenating reagents are all Molecules 2019, 24, 4008; doi:10.3390/molecules24214008 www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules Molecules 2019, 24, 4008 2 of 34 based on the provision of these halogen gases. In addition, the most recent achievements for industrial applications e.g., by up-scaling processes, but also the distribution of these enzymes, as well as the break with assumed dogmas, such as conserved structural motifs, were taken into account. 1.1. Electronical Properties of Halogen Moieties The presence of a halogen (Cl, Br, I) usually increases the bulkiness of a compound, blocking for instance active site pockets or increases membrane permeability, relevant for oral absorption, and blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Besides their bulkiness, halogens exhibit extraordinary effects on the polarization of a compound. On the one hand, the halogens of the upper periods (F, Cl, Br) have a large electronegativity, which leads to a considerable latent polarization in the molecule (see Figure 1A). On the other hand, the polarizability increases with increasing period, so that interactions with soft nucleophiles or electrophiles in particular are promoted (see Figure 1B). Although the latent polarization is depicted in Figure 1A as a homogeneous gradient the model must be refined. Due to the p-orbital architecture there is a hole in the electron density opposing the binding partner of the halogen which is called the \u03c3-hole (Figure 1C). Considering this \u03c3-hole, it offers the option to interact with heteroatoms (O, S, N) by so-called halogen bonds as well as hydrogen bonds [15]. The ability to form halogen bonds has been the focus of several pharmacologically-oriented groups in the past years, as it can serve as an alternative non-covalent interaction between atoms (see Figure 1). For a detailed insight into the nature and characteristics of halogen bonds, as well as their possible impact on drug discovery in the future, see the corresponding articles [4,15\u201319]. The importance of halogens for biological activity of compounds can be profound. Vancomycin (1, Figure 2), an antibiotic, was shown to exhibit 30% to 50% less activity, based on the chlorine substituents missing, which is remarkable considering how small the portion of the halogens with respect to the entire vancomycin molecule is [20]. Molecules 2019, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 34  chemical halogenating reagents are all based on the provision of these halogen gases.

Molecules 2019, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 34  halogens play an important role in the field of drug design and discovery, and usually find their way to the final product assigned for treatment. In the following paragraphs, relevant halogens and some associated drug candidates containing halogen atoms will be discussed regarding their characteristic effects on bioactivity. The most prominent halogen introduced into active agents is fluorine with 57% [3]. Due to its similar size compared to hydrogen and the extreme electronegativity, C\u2013F bonds are polarized in a distinctive manner and render fluorine a weak halogen bond acceptor in contrast to be a good hydrogen-bond acceptor [21,22]. The covalent fluorine bond is very strong (456 kJ/mol for CF4), so that these bonds can only be cleaved under extreme and costly conditions in the body, if at all [23]. This increases the half time of active agents within the body (and environment) compared to their non-fluorinated pendants. Besides the electronic effects of fluorine within a molecule, fluorine also provides stereochemical properties which is summarized as fluorine gauche effect. Briefly, it can be described as a non-bonding weak interaction of the fluorine orbitals and other interacting partners. This reduces the degrees of freedom in rotation and this determines the conformation of a particular fluorinated molecule or guides reaction pathways. A review concerning this topic can be found in reference [24]. Apart from altering molecular characteristics, 18F is used as a common radioactive isotope label for in vivo study of protein function and enzyme catalysis [25]. Of all halogenated active agents, ledipasvir (2, see Figure 2) is one of the top-selling drugs, administered for the treatment of hepatitis C. Another important compound is dacomitinib (3), a single-fluorinated drug, which ha been in clinical trials for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer [26].  Figure 2. Examples for halogenated active agents. Molecules 2019, 24, 4008 4 of 34 carbon bond (327 kJ/mol for CCl4) [23]. Its presence in a compound alters volume and shape, allowing for positioning in deep cavities within proteins. These characteristics make it an interesting option for the functionalization of heterocycles. One of the most prominent chlorine-based natural compounds is rebeccamycin (4), a weak topoisomerase I inhibitor, which showed significant antitumor properties [27]. Brominated compounds are rarely found in drugs, making up only 4% of all halogenated compounds. This seems contradictory at first, as most halogenated compounds originate from marine organisms and are brominated despite chlorine being the more abundant halogen in water. Due to the lower polarization of the carbon-bromine bond and the extended bulkiness, bromine usually forms longer and thereby more labile bonds, not suitable for most drug candidates for a proper inhibition (272 kJ/mol for CBr4) [23]. These characteristics however allow an easier oxidation of bromine and consequently an easier incorporation into molecules, compared to chlorine. Although there is a prevalence of chlorinated and fluorinated active agents in pharmacology, some brominated compounds are known to display relevant bioactivity like eudistomin K (5), viable for the treatment of polio and herpes [28]. Iodine is the rarest halogen used (1%), commonly exploited for the synthesis of the active agents. Having a higher size and lower electronegativity, its bonds formed with carbon atoms are more labile than those of bromine, being easily cleaved off. Iodine is, therefore, preferably suitable for short-lived applications. An example of the use of iodine in medicine is radioactively labelled 124I in positron emission tomography (PET) as a tracer [29]. 1.2. Halogens as Synthetic Tools Both, bromine and iodine, are rare as functional moieties in active agents due to their labile covalent bonds. But it is precisely these properties that make halogens of higher periods valuable instruments for the synthesis of active substances. A patent application for the production of hypohalous acids was applied for in 1944. C. C. Crawford and T. W. Evans described a process to obtain halide-free solutions of hypochlorous acid. This halogenating reagents were used in industrial applications to produce e.g., halohydrins from unsaturated organic compounds [30]. In 1993 another patent to produce concentrated slurries of sodium hypochlorite [35% (w/v)] was accepted [31]. They describe a process for highly pure hypochlorite slurry production. All the processes have the same starting materials in common. The first step is the solvation of molecular chlorine in water to get hypohalous acid (6) or the solution of sodium hydroxide and chlorine in water to end up with sodium hypochlorite. However, contaminations of sodium chloride and remaining sodium hydroxide occur in most processes that are carried out in industrial scale. The chlorine is hereby acquired by the chloralkali process where the electrolysis of sodium chloride produces molecular chlorine gas. Similar processes are state-of-the-art for the production of sodium bromate, which has the drawback of being a strong oxidizing agent [32,33], but can be used for the bromination of aromatic compounds [34]. The production of stable hypobromous acid is rather difficult because it easily oxidizes to bromate. Here, the production is carried out starting from hypochlorous acid or a modified chlorite [35]. More common halogenating agents are N-bromo-succinimide (NBS) and N-chloro-succinimide (NCS). Interestingly, even these reagents are synthesized from molecular halogens or hypohalous acids [36]. As a conclusion, it is now rather obvious, that all halogenating reagents have their origin in molecular halogen gases that are produced by cost-intensive procedures like halogen alkali electrolysis from halide salts (Figure 3).

Molecules 2019, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 34  It is proposed that the catalytic cycle (Figure 9) forms a VV-peroxo-species as the key intermediate, where the halide is added and subsequently hydrolyzed to hypohalous acid.

In contrast to the usually scarce selection of vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidases, many representatives of bromoperoxidases were researched in the past. One of the most prominent members of this group is the VBrPO from Corralina officinalis, a marine red algae. Similarly to the homolog from C. inaequalis, it excels with a high stability towards high temperatures up to 90 \u00b0C and in presence of organic solvents like ethanol, propanol, and acetone (up to 40% v/v) [72]. However, recombinant expression of the gene in E. coli BL21(DE3) proved difficult, as the amount of protein formed is high, but insoluble. Coupe et al. notably showed that by using a refolding procedure, 40 mg/L of active enzyme can be retrieved after expression and isolation [80]. The haloperoxidase was shown to accept a variety of substrates, like nitrogen-containing heterocycles, cyclic \u03b2-diketones, phenol, o-hydroxybenzyl alcohols, anisole (19), 1-methoxynaphthalene and thiophene in addition to alkene halogenations with styrene (16), cyclohexene (22) among others to yield various bromohydrins [81] (see Figure 11 and Table 2).

In most of the cases, no diastereoselectivity for the bromohydrin formation could be observed, except for the formation of bromohydrin from (E)-4-phenyl-buten-2-ol (24) [69]. Besides bromination reactions, haloperoxidases like the Co-VBrPO are able to catalyze sulfoxidations with 2,3-dihydrobenzothiopene (26), as well [82]. Table 2.

In fact, several lipases were tested positively for haloperoxidase activity despite low turnover numbers [81]. The key-step in catalysis is the formation of a peroxo-acid from a carboxylic acid by hydrogen peroxide, which subsequently forms an acylhypohalide acting as the halogenating agent (Figure 12) [86].  Figure 12. Proposed catalytic cycle of metal-free haloperoxidases/perhydrolases. This mechanism was compiled from several sources [81,85]. The catalytic cycle is adopted from the common hydrolase catalysis encountered in lipases and esterases, for instance. In presence of a carboxylic acid, in this case acetic acid, an ester is formed with the catalytic serin residue upon elimination of water (3 \u2018o clock). In presence of hydrogen peroxide, the ester is cleaved, forming a percarboxylic acid. In the following step, a halide binds to the peroxoacid, which is hydrolyzed to the hypohalous acid, while the characteristic Ser-His-Asp triad is already regenerated. Many examples for metal-free HPOs in biotransformations are not known. The majority of investigations of this enzyme class were focused on determining and expanding the tolerance of these enzymes to organic solvents and temperatures. One recent example of a bioorganic application was the halogenation of nucleobases and analogues [87] (see Figure 13). Figure 12. Proposed catalytic cycle of metal-free haloperoxidases/perhydrolases.

Halogenation of indole (28) nucleobase analogs according to Lewkowicz and co-workers [87]. 5.1. Flavin-Dependent Halogenases In addition to the long-known haloperoxidases, another class of enzymes has aroused much interest. It is suspected that flavin-dependent halogenases (FHals, Fl-Hals, or FDHs) evolved from monooxygenases that require flavin cofactors as well and, therefore, belong to the superfamily of flavin-dependent monooxygenases [88,89]. According to what is known so far, there are three natural target structures that can be addressed by FHals. The most studied and best understood group are the flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases. In nature, there is the possibility to halogenate every position of the indole ring. Similar to this structure there is the group of flavin-dependent pyrrole halogenases and finally the flavin-dependent phenol halogenases (see Figure 14) [8]. The fact, that each and every position can be addressed by an individual enzyme demonstrates that FHals are selective halogenating catalysts in contrast to the majority of haloperoxidases. FHals must be differentiated according to the accessibility of their substrates. While a large number of these halogenases are involved in biosynthesis clusters of polyketides (PKS) and non-ribosomal protein synthesis (NRPS), some, such as tryptophan halogenases, can convert freely diffusible substrates and are not dependent on carrier proteins that activate or merely tether the substrate (Figure 14) [13]. For the application of this enzyme group, it is important to keep in mind that they need at least a two-component electron transport chain and therefore require a suitable flavin reductase [90\u201392]. In addition to the reductases that naturally belong to the biosynthesis clusters e.g., PrnF [93], applications with other reductases such as SsuE [91,94,95] or Fre [96,97] from E. coli have also been reported. To avoid the necessity of a second enzyme\u2014the flavin reductase\u2014or even a third enzyme for cofactor recycling, photochemical approaches are in the focus of current research in this field as well [98].

Regioselectivity of flavin-dependent halogenases and their dependency on carrier proteins. * Natural products with halogenations are known, but so far, no enzyme is characterized. ^ This tryptophan halogenase is one of the few examples that is carrier protein-dependent [99]. Figure 14 shows some representatives for the halogenation of the different positions of the Molecules 2019, 24, 4008 16 of 34 e.g., by Shepherd et al., the review of Latham et al. and other publications also show various mutants that led to changes in regioselectivity and substrate scope [8,96,100,109,110]. A lot of these enzymes that are dependent on carrier proteins produce well-known secondary metabolites like rebeccamycin (4) and vancomycin (1) but also a plethora of less investigated biosynthetic pathways [133]. The most important difference in the mechanism between flavin-dependent monooxygenases and halogenases is the conserved motif of two tryptophanes, one isoleucine and proline. This 10 \u00c5 long tunnel [89], first found in PrnA, serves to spatially separate the activated peroxy-flavin FAD(C4\u03b1)\u2013OOH from the substrate binding site and thus prevents oxygenation [114,116,128]. After generating the hypohalides, a conserved lysine transfers the electrophilic chlorine as chloramine from the former peroxy-flavin to the substrate (Figure 15) [134].Molecules 2019, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 19 of 34   Figure 15. Catalytic cycle of halogenation by flavin-dependent halogenases [96,115]. For the phenol halogenase the mechanism is proposed to be slightly altered. The phenolic hydroxyl group is deprotonated by an aspartate within the active site increasing the nucleophilicity of the enol \u03b1-carbon [130]. Based on these conserved motifs and the assumed reaction mechanism some putative halogenases have already been found and annotated. Recently even a viral halogenase VirX1 from cyanophages was discovered, which is the first FHal capable of in vitro iodination and stands out due to its broad substrate spectrum and preferred iodination [135]. Although the community has so far agreed that the preserved motif of separation tunnel and anchor lysine seems to be essential for the activity, current research shows a further class of flavin-dependent halogenases which lack these structural elements completely. One of these examples is the halogenase KerK that is under investigation by Piel and coworkers but has not yet been published except as a poster presentation on Biotrans 2019 in Groningen, the Netherlands [136]. In addition to the advantages of high regioselectivity and thus only few by-products, there are also some disadvantages in the use of this enzyme group. The low conversion rates speak against large-scale application and expression problems often occur. Many of the proteins produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) end up in the insoluble fraction as inclusion bodies. To deal with this issue, strains with co-expression of chaperones are used regularly (Table 3). The overall stability of these proteins also Figure 15.

The overall stability of these proteins also needs further optimization to be applicable in biocatalysis. As a promising result Kemker et al. the tryptophan halogenases were successfully scaled up in terms of a biocatalytic process employing immobilizing the enzymes by cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs).

As a promising result Kemker et al. the tryptophan halogenases were successfully scaled up in terms of a biocatalytic process employing immobilizing the enzymes by cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs). This yielded L-7-bromotryptophan on the gram scale [137]. 5.2. \u03b1-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Halogenases Table 4 shows different natural products that are formed by the iron(II)-\u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent (Fe/\u03b1KG)-halogenases. Despite the huge variety in the product structures they share one common feature, which is the halogen at a sp3-carbon centre. Hence, the Fe/\u03b1KG-halogenase is not limited to nucleophilic substrates like the previous described enzymes. They belong to the Fe/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenase superfamily. The superfamily is known for different transformations such as hydroxylation [138], halogenation [139], desaturation [140], or can be used for the production of ethylene [141]. They all share a structurally conserved metal-binding motif, which in the case of the halogenase developed an active centre that is eventually able to bind a haloge n [139]. The proposed catalytic mechanism of Fe(II)/\u03b1-KG-dependent-halogenase is illustrated in Figure 16.  Figure 16. Proposed mechanism for halogenation reaction by Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenase via a radical C-H functionalization [142]. The highly reactive Fe(IV)-oxo (haloferryl) intermediate is produced by decarboxylation of \u03b1KG to succinate through an oxygen attack. Subsequently abstraction of a hydrogen-atom from the substrate leads to an energetically favourable rearrangement towards Fe(III). Rebound reaction with chloride was shown to depend on the distance and orientation of the substrate [143]. The catalytically cycle is re-established by the hexa-coordinated Fe(II) with water molecules, chloride and histidine. Table 4. Examples of heterologously expressed Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases. Molecules 2019, 24, 4008 22 of 34 substrates. With the discovery of a new Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenase (WelO5) by Hillwig and Liu, it was possible to expand the class towards unbound substrates. WelO5 is capable of late stage halogenation in a regio-and stereoselective manner of different derived isoprenoid-indole alkaloids in the cyanobacterium Hapalosiphon welwitschii (see Table 4) [137,148]. WelO5 showed also a higher robustness and catalysis of approximately 75 turnovers in total [137,148]. Strategies such as adding the cosubstrates consecutively or adding antioxidants like catalases or DTT could increase the turnover number. The narrow substrate scope of WelO5 was tailored in order to have an increased substrate scope like the homolog AmbO5 [138,149]. Most modifications were at the external helix, which is responsible for closing the entry of the active site upon binding of the substrate. It can be assumed that the helix is partially involved in the substrate recognition and specificity [138,149]. A recent publication from Hayashi et al. showed a WelO5 variant with a reshaped active site that led to improved kinetics and an expanded substrate scope, which applies beyond the native indole alkaloid-type substrates [141,152]. This provides the possibility for targeted enzyme-engineering and a basis for further improvements in substrate scope. One possibility is the establishment of nitration and azidation as already shown for SyrB2 [157]. In this regard, it has been shown that WelO5 is able to incorporate the unnatural halide Br-[158]. One drawback of engineering Fe/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases is the hydroxylation as a competitive side reaction [155]. Mitchell et al. used this approach backwards and modified a monooxygenase SadA towards a halogenase [159]. This serves as a proof of concept that with increasing understanding of the reaction mechanism and the involved amino acids the superfamily of monooxygenase can be used as a versatile toolbox in biotechnology. In the future, this may lead to the use of different variants of the very same enzyme for different transformations. Table 4 shows an overview of different characterized Fe/\u03b1KG halogenases and their main published features. Excluded are, for example, halogenase modules of NRPS, where the halogenation is necessary for the subsequently formation of cyclopropane such as in case of CurA [160] or CmaB (see Figure 17) [161]. Molecules 2019, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 22 of 34   Recently Moosmann et al. identified different \u03b1KG-halogenase homologues and their natural products that are produced via a NRPS (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase) pathway. The halogenase were identified by screening the genomic sequence of the cyanobacterium Fischerella sp. PCC 9339 based on feature comparison. Using this approach, the authors were able to distinguish between a Fe/\u03b1KG oxygenase and a corresponding halogenase [143,154]. However, large NRPSs characteristically bind their substrates through an aminoacetylated peptidyl-carrier protein and have a narrow substrate scope [144,155]. Furthermore, they generally showed a low total turnover number, which may result from the well-known autoxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and hence an auto-inactivation of the enzyme [145,156]. In case of SyrB2, total turnovers of 7 \u00b1 2 were observed [133,144] This limits the possibility to modify the enzymes in order to use them as suitable biocatalysts for different unnatural substrates. With the discovery of a new Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenase (WelO5) by Hillwig and Liu, it was possible to expand the class towards unbound substrates.

Excluded are, for example, halogenase modules of NRPS, where the halogenation is necessary for the subsequently formation of cyclopropane such as in case of CurA [160] or CmaB (see Figure 17) [161].  Figure 17. Schematically example for formation of cyclopropane initiated by CmaB through halogenation. 5.3. Fluorinase In contrast to the other described enzymes, the diversity of natural products in case of the fluorinase stem from only one characterized enzyme class to date. The involved enzymes are S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent. The first characterized representative was FlA (5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine synthase) from [162]. The overall family of this enzymes is also able to chlorinate or hydroxylate SAM, as described in detail elsewhere [163]. Within the catalytic cycle fluoride acts as a nucleophile in a SN2-reaction, where it attacks the 5\u2032-carbon of SAM-ribose [164]. In order to act as a nucleophile, fluoride requires to lose its solvation shell. This is achieved in a two-step desolvation with a combination of electrostatic stabilization and hydrogen bonding. In the first step, fluoride is binding to the active site and exchanges water molecules of its shell in order to form hydrogen bonds with the enzyme. Upon binding of SAM the desolvation of fluoride is complete. The electropositive 5\u2032-carbon attached to the sulfur group in SAM coordinates with the fluoride [165,166]. This electrostatic stabilization facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the fluoride and C-F-bond formation of the reactive 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032deoxyadenosine (33, 5\u2032-FDA) intermediate [166]. Subsequently, 5\u2032-FDA (33) is further metabolized in order to generate a variety of compounds as shown in Figure 18A [162]. However, this also represents a major obstacle for the application of these enzymes to unnatural small organic molecules, since the product formation follows a cascade of enzymatic steps. Eust\u00e1quio et al. tried to use this enzyme for the production of fluorosalinosporamide, an unnatural Molecules 2019, 24, 4008 23 of 34 analog of salinosporamide, which is fluorinated rather than chlorinated, however, the yield was moderate [167]. Nevertheless, different approaches have been implemented to increase the substrate scope and use the enzyme as rather flexible tool for medical applications. Besides the ability to fluoride compounds, fluorinase is also able to exchange a chloride at the 5\u2032-carbon of the SAM ribose ring by a fluoride and form 5\u2032-FDA (33, Figure 18B) [168]. This overall trans-halogenation reaction was used for late-stage fluorination for the production of radiolabeled imaging reagents. Recently, different pre-targeting strategies have been developed for treatment and imaging of different diseases. Those include e.g., radiolabeling of the human A2A adenosine receptor [169], a prostate cancer-related membrane protein [170] or the combined application of biotin and tetrazine-conjugate with antibodies [171]. In all cases, it was shown that the fluorinase (FlA) accepts substrates with different moiety at C-2 of the adenine ring. So far two crystal structures of fluorinase homologs from S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37 are known and they both have a high structurally conformity [172]. In general all five known fluorinases have a high similarity of over 80% and show similar kinetic profiles [173]. Through a directed evolution approach of FlA1, different crucial amino acids for substrate binding, halide binding and hence activity were identified [174]. Additionally, the variants were tested with different unnatural substrates [175]. It was shown that the tolerance for the wild type (wt) enzyme is limited to C-2 modified substrates. However, generated variants of FlA1 also demonstrated an activity for an unnatural substrate, which were modified at C-6 positions of the adenine ring with a chlorine group [175]. These findings show that despite a narrow substrate scope of the fluorinase, it was possible to successfully apply different unnatural substrates and lay a base for directed evolution as means to use small organic compounds as substrates. However, the dependence of electrophilic substrate structures remains a drawback for the nucleophilic attack of fluoride. The crystal structure with an unnatural substrate (containing difluoromethyl groups) confirmed the necessity of geometry for activating the fluorine atom for substitution [176]. This outlines the challenge to use fluorinases as a versatile tool to generate fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds. Nevertheless, by means of designing appropriate leaving groups in combination with enzyme engineering, fluorinases could be used as tool for future generation of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds.

Nevertheless, these enzymes open up a wide horizon of possibilities. Enormous genome data are revealing more and more halogenating enzymes and even new classes of halogenating enzymes cannot be excluded at present. Thus, there is a need for detailed and systematic research to employ halogenating enzymes for active agent synthesis, to alter their substrate scopes and enhance their process stability.

        "Abstract: Halogens can be very important for active agents as vital parts of their binding mode, on the one hand, but are on the other hand instrumental in the synthesis of most active agents. However, the primary halogenating compound is molecular chlorine which has two major drawbacks, high energy consumption and hazardous handling. Nature bypassed molecular halogens and evolved at least six halogenating enzymes: Three kind of haloperoxidases, flavin-dependent halogenases as well as \u03b1-ketoglutarate and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent halogenases. This review shows what is known today on these enzymes in terms of biocatalytic usage. The reader may understand this review as a plea for the usage of halogenating enzymes for fine chemical syntheses, but there are many steps to take until halogenating enzymes are reliable, flexible, and sustainable catalysts for halogenation.",

        "and deduce lead structures and functionalities for the assembly of active agent libraries. Although most natural compounds are not halogenated, halogenation is spread over virtually all classes of secondary metabolites. Most of the halogenated natural compounds are of marine origin, while some are found in plants and insects as well [1]. Halogens appear in some form in 40% of all drugs being tested in clinical trials [2\u20134]. In addition to the fact that halogenations are an important structural motifs in natural substances and thus also in the resulting active substances, halogenations play a major role in the synthesis of many active substances. In the following, we want to figure out what is so special about the simple halogen moieties within molecules and reactions that make them so desirable, although the synthesis is very energy-demanding and carried out with toxic molecular halogens such as chlorine gas. In the second half of this review article we would like to show how nature realizes halogenations enzymatically and where we stand technologically to employ them as tools. In recent years, these enzymes have become even more prominent and the various scientific advances in this field have already been presented several times in an overview. These reviews also provide an up-to-date overview of the different enzymes, their substrate scope and biotechnological developments as well as the diversity of halo-compounds from all kingdoms of life [5\u201314]. The aim of this review is\u2014among other things\u2014to include a further point of view. In addition to the accurate arguments on the toxicity of elemental halogens and the cost-effectiveness of halide salts, a closer look at the actual costs of chlorine gas production was included, as well as a clear presentation that chemical halogenating reagents are all",

        "for instance active site pockets or increases membrane permeability, relevant for oral absorption, and blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Besides their bulkiness, halogens exhibit extraordinary effects on the polarization of a compound. On the one hand, the halogens of the upper periods (F, Cl, Br) have a large electronegativity, which leads to a considerable latent polarization in the molecule (see Figure 1A). On the other hand, the polarizability increases with increasing period, so that interactions with soft nucleophiles or electrophiles in particular are promoted (see Figure 1B). Although the latent polarization is depicted in Figure 1A as a homogeneous gradient the model must be refined. Due to the p-orbital architecture there is a hole in the electron density opposing the binding partner of the halogen which is called the \u03c3-hole (Figure 1C). Considering this \u03c3-hole, it offers the option to interact with heteroatoms (O, S, N) by so-called halogen bonds as well as hydrogen bonds [15]. The ability to form halogen bonds has been the focus of several pharmacologically-oriented groups in the past years, as it can serve as an alternative non-covalent interaction between atoms (see Figure 1). For a detailed insight into the nature and characteristics of halogen bonds, as well as their possible impact on drug discovery in the future, see the corresponding articles [4,15\u201319]. The importance of halogens for biological activity of compounds can be profound. Vancomycin (1, Figure 2), an antibiotic, was shown to exhibit 30% to 50% less activity, based on the chlorine substituents missing, which is remarkable considering how small the portion of the halogens with respect to the entire vancomycin molecule is [20].",

In the following paragraphs, relevant halogens and some associated drug candidates containing halogen atoms will be discussed regarding their characteristic effects on bioactivity. The most prominent halogen introduced into active agents is fluorine with 57% [3]. Due to its",
        "similar size compared to hydrogen and the extreme electronegativity, C\u2013F bonds are polarized in a distinctive manner and render fluorine a weak halogen bond acceptor in contrast to be a good hydrogen-bond acceptor [21,22]. The covalent fluorine bond is very strong (456 kJ/mol for CF4), so that these bonds can only be cleaved under extreme and costly conditions in the body, if at all [23]. This increases the half time of active agents within the body (and environment) compared to their non-fluorinated pendants. Besides the electronic effects of fluorine within a molecule, fluorine also provides stereochemical properties which is summarized as fluorine gauche effect. Briefly, it can be described as a non-bonding weak interaction of the fluorine orbitals and other interacting partners. This reduces the degrees of freedom in rotation and this determines the conformation of a particular fluorinated molecule or guides reaction pathways. A review concerning this topic can be found in reference [24]. Apart from altering molecular characteristics, 18F is used as a common radioactive isotope label for in vivo study of protein function and enzyme catalysis [25]. Of all halogenated active agents, ledipasvir (2, see Figure 2) is one of the top-selling drugs, administered for the treatment of hepatitis C. Another important compound is dacomitinib (3), a single-fluorinated drug, which ha been in clinical trials for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer [26].",

        "carbon bond (327 kJ/mol for CCl4) [23]. Its presence in a compound alters volume and shape, allowing for positioning in deep cavities within proteins. These characteristics make it an interesting option for the functionalization of heterocycles. One of the most prominent chlorine-based natural compounds is rebeccamycin (4), a weak topoisomerase I inhibitor, which showed significant antitumor properties [27]. Brominated compounds are rarely found in drugs, making up only 4% of all halogenated",
        "compounds. This seems contradictory at first, as most halogenated compounds originate from marine organisms and are brominated despite chlorine being the more abundant halogen in water. Due to the lower polarization of the carbon-bromine bond and the extended bulkiness, bromine usually forms longer and thereby more labile bonds, not suitable for most drug candidates for a proper inhibition (272 kJ/mol for CBr4) [23]. These characteristics however allow an easier oxidation of bromine and consequently an easier incorporation into molecules, compared to chlorine. Although there is a prevalence of chlorinated and fluorinated active agents in pharmacology, some brominated compounds are known to display relevant bioactivity like eudistomin K (5), viable for the treatment of polio and herpes [28]. Iodine is the rarest halogen used (1%), commonly exploited for the synthesis of the active agents.",
        "Having a higher size and lower electronegativity, its bonds formed with carbon atoms are more labile than those of bromine, being easily cleaved off. Iodine is, therefore, preferably suitable for short-lived applications. An example of the use of iodine in medicine is radioactively labelled 124I in positron emission tomography (PET) as a tracer [29].",

        "Crawford and T. W. Evans described a process to obtain halide-free solutions of hypochlorous acid. This halogenating reagents were used in industrial applications to produce e.g., halohydrins from unsaturated organic compounds [30]. In 1993 another patent to produce concentrated slurries of sodium hypochlorite [35% (w/v)] was accepted [31]. They describe a process for highly pure hypochlorite slurry production. All the processes have the same starting materials in common. The first step is the solvation of molecular chlorine in water to get hypohalous acid (6) or the solution of sodium hydroxide and chlorine in water to end up with sodium hypochlorite. However, contaminations of sodium chloride and remaining sodium hydroxide occur in most processes that are carried out in industrial scale. The chlorine is hereby acquired by the chloralkali process where the electrolysis of sodium chloride produces molecular chlorine gas. Similar processes are state-of-the-art for the production of sodium bromate, which has the drawback of being a strong oxidizing agent [32,33], but can be used for the bromination of aromatic compounds [34]. The production of stable hypobromous acid is rather difficult because it easily oxidizes to bromate. Here, the production is carried out starting from hypochlorous acid or a modified chlorite [35]. More common halogenating agents are N-bromo-succinimide (NBS) and N-chloro-succinimide",
        "(NCS). Interestingly, even these reagents are synthesized from molecular halogens or hypohalous acids [36]. As a conclusion, it is now rather obvious, that all halogenating reagents have their origin in molecular halogen gases that are produced by cost-intensive procedures like halogen alkali electrolysis from halide salts (Figure 3).",

WelO5 showed also a higher robustness and catalysis of approximately 75 turnovers in total [137,148]. Strategies such as adding the cosubstrates consecutively or adding antioxidants like catalases or DTT could increase the turnover number. The narrow substrate scope of WelO5 was tailored in order to have an increased substrate scope like the homolog AmbO5 [138,149]. Most modifications were at the external helix, which is responsible for closing the entry of the active site upon binding of the substrate. It can be assumed that the helix is partially involved in the substrate recognition and specificity [138,149]. A recent publication from Hayashi et al. showed a WelO5 variant with a reshaped active site that led to improved kinetics and an expanded substrate scope, which applies beyond the native indole alkaloid-type substrates [141,152]. This provides the possibility for targeted enzyme-engineering and a basis for further improvements in substrate scope.

However, large NRPSs characteristically bind their substrates through an aminoacetylated peptidyl-carrier protein and have a narrow substrate scope [144,155]. Furthermore, they generally showed a low total turnover number, which may result from the well-known autoxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and hence an auto-inactivation of the enzyme [145,156]. In case of SyrB2, total turnovers of 7 \u00b1 2 were observed [133,144] This limits the possibility to modify the enzymes in order to use them as suitable biocatalysts for different unnatural substrates.

This serves as a proof of concept that with increasing understanding of the reaction mechanism and the involved amino acids the superfamily of monooxygenase can be used as a versatile toolbox in biotechnology. In the future, this may lead to the use of different variants of the very same enzyme for different transformations. Table 4 shows an overview of different characterized Fe/\u03b1KG halogenases and their main published features. Excluded are, for example, halogenase modules of NRPS, where the halogenation is necessary for the subsequently formation of cyclopropane such as in case of CurA [160] or CmaB (see Figure 17) [161].",

        "the fluorinase stem from only one characterized enzyme class to date. The involved enzymes are S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent. The first characterized representative was FlA (5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine synthase) from [162]. The overall family of this enzymes is also able to chlorinate or hydroxylate SAM, as described in detail elsewhere [163]. Within the catalytic cycle fluoride acts as a nucleophile in a SN2-reaction, where it attacks the 5\u2032-carbon of SAM-ribose [164]. In order to act as a nucleophile, fluoride requires to lose its solvation shell. This is achieved in a two-step desolvation with a combination of electrostatic stabilization and hydrogen bonding. In the first step, fluoride is binding to the active site and exchanges water molecules of its shell in order to form hydrogen bonds with the enzyme. Upon binding of SAM the desolvation of fluoride is complete. The electropositive 5\u2032-carbon attached to the sulfur group in SAM coordinates with the fluoride [165,166]. This electrostatic stabilization facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the fluoride and C-F-bond formation of the reactive 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032deoxyadenosine (33, 5\u2032-FDA) intermediate [166]. Subsequently, 5\u2032-FDA (33) is further metabolized in order to generate a variety of compounds as shown in Figure 18A [162]. However, this also represents a major obstacle for the application of these enzymes to unnatural small organic molecules, since the product formation follows a cascade of enzymatic steps. Eust\u00e1quio et al. tried to use this enzyme for the production of fluorosalinosporamide, an unnatural",
        "Molecules 2019, 24, 4008 23 of 34",
        "analog of salinosporamide, which is fluorinated rather than chlorinated, however, the yield was moderate [167]. Nevertheless, different approaches have been implemented to increase the substrate scope and use the enzyme as rather flexible tool for medical applications. Besides the ability to fluoride compounds, fluorinase is also able to exchange a chloride at the 5\u2032-carbon of the SAM ribose ring by a fluoride and form 5\u2032-FDA (33, Figure 18B) [168]. This overall trans-halogenation reaction was used for late-stage fluorination for the production of radiolabeled imaging reagents. Recently, different pre-targeting strategies have been developed for treatment and imaging of different diseases. Those include e.g., radiolabeling of the human A2A adenosine receptor [169], a prostate cancer-related membrane protein [170] or the combined application of biotin and tetrazine-conjugate with antibodies [171]. In all cases, it was shown that the fluorinase (FlA) accepts substrates with different moiety at C-2 of the adenine ring. So far two crystal structures of fluorinase homologs from S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37 are known and they both have a high structurally conformity [172]. In general all five known fluorinases have a high similarity of over 80% and show similar kinetic profiles [173]. Through a directed evolution approach of FlA1, different crucial amino acids for substrate binding, halide binding and hence activity were identified [174]. Additionally, the variants were tested with different unnatural substrates [175]. It was shown that the tolerance for the wild type (wt) enzyme is limited to C-2 modified substrates. However, generated variants of FlA1 also demonstrated an activity for an unnatural substrate, which were modified at C-6 positions of the adenine ring with a chlorine group [175]. These findings show that despite a narrow substrate scope of the fluorinase, it was possible to successfully apply different unnatural substrates and lay a base for directed evolution as means to use small organic compounds as substrates. However, the dependence of electrophilic substrate structures remains a drawback for the nucleophilic attack of fluoride. The crystal structure with an unnatural substrate (containing difluoromethyl groups) confirmed the necessity of geometry for activating the fluorine atom for substitution [176]. This outlines the challenge to use fluorinases as a versatile tool to generate fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds. Nevertheless, by means of designing appropriate leaving groups in combination with enzyme engineering, fluorinases could be used as tool for future generation of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds.
