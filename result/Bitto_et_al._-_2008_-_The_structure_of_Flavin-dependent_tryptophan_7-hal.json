INTRODUCTION Enzyme catalyzed regio-and stereo-specific halogena-tions influence the biological activity of a diverse array of therapeutically important natural products, including the antibiotics vancomycin and chloramphenicol as well as the anticancer agents calicheamicin and rebeccamycin.1\u20135 The major class of enzymes responsible for this challeng-ing synthetic reaction, the flavin-dependent halogenases, catalyzes the formation of carbon-halogen bonds using flavin, a halide ion (ClNone, BrNone or INone), and O2.6 Recent mechanistic and structural advances achieved with the model flavin-dependent tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA and RebH7\u201310 have greatly enhanced the level of under-standing of this unique reaction. According to these stud-ies, the mechanism for tryptophan halogenation proceeds via FAD(C4a)NoneNoneOOH activation of a chloride ion into the transient chlorinating species HOCl.11\u201314 The key evidence for the requirement of a transient chlorinating species is the discovery that a None10-A\u030a-long tunnel sepa-rates FAD and tryptophan in the ligand-bound form of PrnA.12 In a recent compelling study to elucidate the strategy by which RebH controls this highly reactive and indiscriminant oxidant, a Lys79-eNH-Cl chloramine in-termediate was implicated as the actual chlorinating spe-cies within RebH and a structural investigation of RebH was reported.10 Here we report our independent struc-tural analysis of Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes RebH (Uni-Prot accession number Q8KHZ8, 530 amino acids) in its apo-form as well as in a complex with both tryptophan and FAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and expression The rebH gene was amplified from Cosmid DNA pJST23019 using the primer pair 50-GGTACGTCATAT-GTCCGGCAAGA-30 and 50-GACGTAAGCTTCCGTCTG-TCAGC-30. After restriction digestion with NdeI/HindIII (Promega, Madison, WI), the PCR products were ligated into NdeI/HindIII-linearized pET28a (Novagen, San Diego, CA) containing an amino-terminal His10-tag. The cloned expression plasmid was confirmed by sequencing and subsequently transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for expression. Cells were grown at 378C until reaching an optical density at 600 nm of 0.9 and then induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for additional 40 h at 168C. Protein purification Cells were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM so-dium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 8) and disrupted by sonication. Insoluble debris was re-moved by centrifugation at 10,000g for 1 h, and the su-pernatant with the His10-fusion construct was captured *Correspondence to: George N.

The recombi-nant protein was eluted with a linear 20\u2013500 mM imid-azole gradient, desalted using a PD-10 column (Amer-sham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The final storage buffer contained 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 20% glycerol. Protein used for crystallization trials was dialyzed into the solution containing 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS) pH 8.0. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Activity assay Typical assays were conducted at 303 K in 100 lL total volume 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.6 mM L-Trp, 0.2 mg/mL RebH, 50 lM FAD and 100 mM halide (NaCl or NaBr) and an in situ flavin reduction system. In situ flavin reduction was accom-plished using either 20 mM NADH and 0.2 unit/mL NADH oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) or 20 mM DTT. At given time points, a reaction aliquot was removed, diluted with an equal volume of MeOH, centrifuged to remove pre-cipitated protein, and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Phenomenex LUNA C18, 100 A\u030a, 4.6 3 250 mm; 1 mL/ min; isocratic for the first 0\u201310 min, 15% B followed by a gradient of 15\u201380% B from 10\u201317 min; A, H2O/0.1% TFA; B, acetonitrile; A280). RebH specific activity was consistent with previous reports14 and all halogenated products were confirmed by LC-MS. Protein crystallization Crystals of native RebH were grown at 277 K by the hanging drop method from a 18 mg mLNone1 protein solu-tion in a buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM tris(hydroxyme-thyl)aminomethane (TRIS) pH 8.0) mixed with an equal amount of the well solution (0.5 M NaH2PO4, 0.9 M K2HPO4). Crystals with shape of trigonal bi-pyramids and dimensions up to 300 3 40 3 40 lm grew from a heavy precipitate in several months. Crystals were cryo-protected at 277 K by soaking in well solutions contain-ing 10, 20, and 30% (v/v) glycerol and were flash frozen in a stream of cryogenic nitrogen gas at 100 K. To pre-pare the complex, the RebH crystals were placed for 22 h in the soaking solution containing 0.3 M NaH2PO4, 0.6 M K2HPO4, None5 mM FAD, None3 mM tryptophan, and 30 mM NaCl. Crystals were cryoprotected by stepwise addi-tion of 100% (v/v) glycerol to the soaking solution until None30% (v/v) final concentration of glycerol was achieved. Diffraction data collection X-ray diffraction data for both the apo-structure and the substrate complex were collected at the General Med-icine and Cancer Institute Collaborative Access Team (GM/CA-CAT) 23-ID-D beamline at the Advanced Pho-ton Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Each of the 200 diffraction images for the apo-structure was collected at a crystal-to-detector distance of 325 mm and exposed for 4 s with 100-fold attenuation of the incident beam. The data were collected in a single pass with 18 oscilla-tions per frame. Each of the 360 diffraction images for the complex was collected at a crystal-to-detector dis-tance of 250 mm and exposed for 6 s with 200-fold attenuation of the incident beam. The data were collected by inverse-beam strategy with 308 wedges and 18 oscilla-tion per frame. The diffraction images were integrated and scaled using HKL2000.15 Crystals belong to the space group P62 with unit cell parameters a \u00bc b \u00bc 114.8 A\u030a, c \u00bc 230.6 A\u030a. Structure determination The apo-structure of RebH was solved by molecular replacement in MOLREP16 using the structure of Pseu-domonas fluorescens PrnA as a search model (PDB ID 2aqj, 55% identity). The outstanding solution with R-factor of 0.46 and a correlation coefficient of 0.49 was obtained after two molecules were placed in the asym-metric unit. Prerefinement of the molecular replacement solution without noncrystallographic symmetry con-straints in REFMAC517 resulted in a model with R \u00bc 32.5% (Rfree \u00bc 37.5%). To reduce the model bias and improve the initial map quality, rA-weighted model phases were density modified in DM18 with 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging constraints. The atomic model was then built based on the resulting phases using an automatic building procedure imple-mented in ARP/WARP.19 The initial model obtained from this procedure had R \u00bc 21.2% (Rfree \u00bc 26.3%) and contained 978 residues of which 956 had side-chains assigned. The structure was completed with multiple cycles of manual building in COOT20 and refinement in REFMAC5.17 Final refinement protocol included TLS refinement21 with 10 TLS-groups per molecule22 and used medium noncrystallographic symmetry restraints to relate the main-chain atoms of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final refined model has R \u00bc 16.1% (Rfree \u00bc 20.8%). The structure of the complex was rebuilt by ARP/WARP from the apo-structure model and refined using the protocol described for the apo-structure. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure quality The structure of Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes RebH was determined by molecular replacement in MOLREP using the structure of the PrnA monomer12 as a search model (PDB ID 2aqj) and was refined to a resolution of 2.5 A\u030a.

Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics for both the apo-and complex structures are summarized in Table I. The final model of apo-RebH contains residues 3\u2013526 of chains A and residues 3\u2013528 of chain B; terminal residues were not observed in the electron density and therefore not included in the model. Similarly, the final model of the RebH complex contains residues 2\u2013528 of chains A and residues 2\u2013528 of chain B. The chloride anion was modeled in the active site of molecule A of the RebH complex based on the structural similarity to the PrnA-FAD-chloride complex.12 This interpretation is further supported by the existence of a 4.5r-peak in the rA-weighted 2Fo-Fc electron density map at the expected position, compared to 2.0r, 2.2r, 2.6r, 3.4r peaks of the nearby water molecules. Clear electron density was observed for bound tryptophans in both modeled molecules. In addition, well defined elec-tron density for FAD was observed in molecule A. How-ever, the electron density corresponding to the cofactor in molecule B showed a significant disorder and only allowed for unambiguous modeling of the adenosine por-tion of FAD. Comparison of RebH and PrnA structures RebH and PrnA share 55% sequence identity and their structures align closely with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.68 A\u030a for 3238 structurally equivalent atoms; this value is consistent with these proteins having a very similar fold. Similarly to PrnA, the crystal structure of RebH revealed that this protein forms a dimer with a buried surface area of 1630 A\u030a2.

Each monomer of RebH folds into a single domain with a complex topology described previously for PrnA.12 As in the case of the PrnA structure, flavin and tryptophan binding sites are separated by None10 A\u030a [Fig. 1(a)]. Two notable structural differences exist between struc-tures of these proteins: (i) a surface-exposed loop that spans residues 86\u2013105 in RebH harbors an eight-residue insertion [Fig. 1(a), red arrow] compared to the analo-gous loop in PrnA (residues 87\u201397), (ii) the conserved loop that spans residues 40\u201348 in both RebH and PrnA adopts entirely different conformation [Fig. 1(a), black arrow]. In PrnA, the loop forms multiple direct hydrogen bonds to FAD as well as hydrogen bonds that are part of the hydrogen bond networks involving structurally con-served water molecules in contact with FAD. In RebH, the same loop adopts an \u2018\u2018open\u2019\u2019 conformation, which is not in contact with the cofactor. As a result, the flavin binding site as observed in the RebH complex remains solvent exposed. The electron density for loop 40\u201348 was of lower quality in both apo-RebH and the RebH com-plex structures than for the rest of protein, indicating that this loop is quite flexible. The loop was partially sta-bilized in the observed conformation by the crystallo-graphic contact with the RebH molecule related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis located in the proximity of Pro43. Despite the structural differences in this loop, the conformation of both the cofactor and the bound tryptophan are very similar in both RebH and PrnA [Fig. 1(a), sticks]. Figure 1 Structure of RebH.

See the Term s and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com /term s-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Com m ons License Comparison of apo-RebH and the RebH complex The apo-RebH structure and the RebH complex align with a rmsd of 0.216 A\u030a for 3866 structurally correspond-ing atoms from chains A and a rmsd of 0.187 A\u030a for 3836 structurally corresponding atoms from chains B. The dimers of apo-RebH and the RebH complex align with rmsd of 0.276 for 7752 structurally corresponding atoms. These low values confirm that no large-scale changes in tertiary and/or quaternary structure took place upon binding of substrate and cofactor. The only notable change between the structures of apo-RebH and the RebH complex is related to the ordering of the loop comprising residues 111\u2013114, which are involved in for-mation of the tryptophan binding site. In apo-RebH crystals, the electron density corresponding to this loop is of poor quality, indicating that the loop is flexible. Upon tryptophan binding, the loop undergoes a confor-mational change that flips the peptide carbonyl of Gly112 and displaces sidechain of Leu113 by as much as 5 A\u030a. Substrate binding results in an apparent stabilization of the loop as judged by the well-defined electron density [Fig. 1(b)]. Upon the conformational change, the bound tryptophan becomes completely buried within the inte-rior cavity of RebH. In addition to tryptophan, a well or-dered water molecule becomes trapped in the substrate-binding cavity; this water molecule participates in a hydrogen bond network that further stabilizes the bound tryptophan [Fig. 1(b)].

According to these stud-ies, the mechanism for tryptophan halogenation proceeds via FAD(C4a)NoneNoneOOH activation of a chloride ion into the transient chlorinating species HOCl.11\u201314 The key evidence for the requirement of a transient chlorinating species is the discovery that a None10-A\u030a-long tunnel sepa-rates FAD and tryptophan in the ligand-bound form of PrnA.12 In a recent compelling study to elucidate the strategy by which RebH controls this highly reactive and indiscriminant oxidant, a Lys79-eNH-Cl chloramine in-termediate was implicated as the actual chlorinating spe-cies within RebH and a structural investigation of RebH was reported.10 Here we report our independent struc-tural analysis of Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes RebH (Uni-Prot accession number Q8KHZ8, 530 amino acids) in its apo-form as well as in a complex with both tryptophan and FAD.",
        "MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and expression The rebH gene was amplified from Cosmid DNA pJST23019 using the primer pair 50-GGTACGTCATAT-GTCCGGCAAGA-30 and 50-GACGTAAGCTTCCGTCTG-TCAGC-30. After restriction digestion with NdeI/HindIII (Promega, Madison, WI), the PCR products were ligated into NdeI/HindIII-linearized pET28a (Novagen, San Diego, CA) containing an amino-terminal His10-tag. The cloned expression plasmid was confirmed by sequencing and subsequently transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for expression. Cells were grown at 378C until reaching an optical density at 600 nm of 0.9 and then induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for additional 40 h at 168C.",
        "Protein purification Cells were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM so-dium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 8) and disrupted by sonication. Insoluble debris was re-moved by centrifugation at 10,000g for 1 h, and the su-pernatant with the His10-fusion construct was captured",

        "Structure determination The apo-structure of RebH was solved by molecular replacement in MOLREP16 using the structure of Pseu-domonas fluorescens PrnA as a search model (PDB ID 2aqj, 55% identity). The outstanding solution with R-factor of 0.46 and a correlation coefficient of 0.49 was obtained after two molecules were placed in the asym-metric unit. Prerefinement of the molecular replacement solution without noncrystallographic symmetry con-straints in REFMAC517 resulted in a model with R \u00bc 32.5% (Rfree \u00bc 37.5%). To reduce the model bias and improve the initial map quality, rA-weighted model phases were density modified in DM18 with 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging constraints. The atomic model was then built based on the resulting phases using an automatic building procedure imple-mented in ARP/WARP.19 The initial model obtained from this procedure had R \u00bc 21.2% (Rfree \u00bc 26.3%) and contained 978 residues of which 956 had side-chains assigned. The structure was completed with multiple cycles of manual building in COOT20 and refinement in REFMAC5.17 Final refinement protocol included TLS refinement21 with 10 TLS-groups per molecule22 and used medium noncrystallographic symmetry restraints to relate the main-chain atoms of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit.

Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics for both the apo-and complex structures are summarized in Table I. The final model of apo-RebH contains residues 3\u2013526 of chains A and residues 3\u2013528 of chain B; terminal residues were not observed in the electron density and therefore not included in the model. Similarly, the final model of the RebH complex contains residues 2\u2013528 of chains A and residues 2\u2013528 of chain B. The chloride anion was modeled in the active site of molecule A of the RebH complex based on the structural similarity to the PrnA-FAD-chloride complex.12 This interpretation is further supported by the existence of a 4.5r-peak in the rA-weighted 2Fo-Fc electron density map at the expected position, compared to 2.0r, 2.2r, 2.6r, 3.4r peaks of the nearby water molecules.

        "The apo-RebH structure and the RebH complex align with a rmsd of 0.216 A\u030a for 3866 structurally correspond-ing atoms from chains A and a rmsd of 0.187 A\u030a for 3836 structurally corresponding atoms from chains B. The dimers of apo-RebH and the RebH complex align with rmsd of 0.276 for 7752 structurally corresponding atoms. These low values confirm that no large-scale changes in tertiary and/or quaternary structure took place upon binding of substrate and cofactor. The only notable change between the structures of apo-RebH and the RebH complex is related to the ordering of the loop comprising residues 111\u2013114, which are involved in for-mation of the tryptophan binding site. In apo-RebH crystals, the electron density corresponding to this loop is of poor quality, indicating that the loop is flexible. Upon tryptophan binding, the loop undergoes a confor-mational change that flips the peptide carbonyl of Gly112 and displaces sidechain of Leu113 by as much as 5 A\u030a. Substrate binding results in an apparent stabilization of the loop as judged by the well-defined electron density [Fig. 1(b)]. Upon the conformational change, the bound tryptophan becomes completely buried within the inte-rior cavity of RebH. In addition to tryptophan, a well or-dered water molecule becomes trapped in the substrate-binding cavity; this water molecule participates in a hydrogen bond network that further stabilizes the bound tryptophan [Fig. 1(b)].",
