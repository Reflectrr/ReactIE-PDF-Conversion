Naismith1 1Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, The University of St Andrews, Fife KY16 9ST, UK 2University Chemical Laboratory, Lensfield Road, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK ............................................................................................................................................................................. Fluorine is the thirteenth most abundant element in the earth\u2019s crust, but fluoride concentrations in surface water are low and fluorinated metabolites are extremely rare1,2. The fluoride ion is a potent nucleophile in its desolvated state, but is tightly hydrated in water and effectively inert. Low availability and a lack of chemical reactivity have largely excluded fluoride from biochem-istry: in particular, fluorine\u2019s high redox potential precludes the haloperoxidase-type mechanism3,4 used in the metabolic incorporation of chloride and bromide ions. But fluorinated chemicals are growing in industrial importance, with appli-cations in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials pro-ducts5\u20137. Reactive fluorination reagents requiring specialist process technologies are needed in industry and, although biological catalysts for these processes are highly sought after, only one enzyme that can convert fluoride to organic fluorine has been described8. Streptomyces cattleya can form carbon\u2013fluorine bonds9 and must therefore have evolved an enzyme able to overcome the chemical challenges of using aqueous fluoride. Here we report the sequence and three-dimensional structure of the first native fluorination enzyme, 5 0 -fluoro-5 0 -deoxyadeno-sine synthase, from this organism. Both substrate and products have been observed bound to the enzyme, enabling us to propose a nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this biological fluori-nation reaction. When grown in the presence of F2 ions, S. cattleya secretes fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine, demonstrating its ability to biosynthesize organofluorine metabolites9. This organism contains an enzyme with a relative molecular mass (M r) of 32,200 that has been shown to catalyse the formation of a C\u2013F bond by combining S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and F2 to generate 5 0-fluoro-5 0-deoxyadenosine (5 0-FDA) and L-methionine (ref. 10 and Fig. 1). Purification11 and now overexpression of 5 0-fluoro-5 0-deoxyade-nosine synthase (5 0-FDAS) have allowed a fuller characterization of activity: the enzyme has a catalytic rate constant (k cat) of Figure 1 5 0 -FDAS from S. cattleya catalyses the formation of 5 0 -FDA from SAM and an F2 ion. 5 0 -FDA is the first-formed organofluorine metabolite, which is ultimately converted to fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT) through fluoroacetaldehyde (FAld) by S. cattleya30. FAc is a toxin and 4-FT has antibiotic activity. letters to nature NATURE |VOL 427 | 5 FEBRUARY 2004 | www.nature.com/nature 561\u00a9 2004Nature PublishingGroup Figure 2 Structure of 5 0 -FDAS, drawn by PyMOL31. a, Stereoview of monomer unit (monomer A) in cartoon form, showing the N-terminal (top) and C-terminal (bottom) domains linked by a single polypeptide strand.

Mutants of two glycosidase enzymes, which create a very potent electrophile, can catalyse carbon\u2013halogen (F2, Cl2 and Br2) bond formation; however, the fluorinated com-pounds are reactive and have not been isolated8. The gene encoding 5 0-FDAS was cloned by degenerate polymer-ase chain reaction (PCR) on the basis of the partial protein sequence of the wild-type enzyme11 using genomic DNA from S. cattleya as a template. Sequence information obtained from the degenerate PCRs was used to determine the complete coding sequence (flA) for the enzyme. The flA gene is 897 base pairs (bp) in size and encodes a protein containing 299 amino acids. The flA gene amplified by PCR was inserted into the pET28a(\u00fe) plasmid and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The M r of the purified recombinant product of flA (Glu-Ser2-His6-Ser2-Glu-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Glu-Ser-His-FlA) was 34,402, in agreement with electronspray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data for the wild-type enzyme11. Crystallographic phases were determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) from the selenomethionine (SeMet)-containing enzyme. These phases were used to determine the structure of the wild-type enzyme purified from S. cattleya to 1.9 A\u030a. The refined structure contains residues 8\u2013298 from the total of 299 residues: the first seven and the last residue are not visible. The monomer is organized as an amino-terminal (residues 8\u2013180) and a smaller carboxy-terminal (residues 195\u2013298) domain (Fig. 2a). A distinctive, long, extended loop of 15 residues connects the two domains, which are otherwise linked by few interactions. No structural homologues were found for either domain by the SSM12 and the DALI13 queries, and thus there is no indication of an alternative or additional function. The N-terminal domain has a central seven-stranded b-sheet, which combines parallel and antiparallel strands sandwiched between a-helices (Fig. 2a). The C-terminal domain is composed of a five-and a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet. The Pfam database14 assigns the enzyme to family PF01887, and the structure provides the fold for this superfamily. Notably, no member of this superfamily has a known function. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a trimer (Fig. 2b): the three N-terminal domains are arranged around a three-fold axis and make intimate contacts with each other; the three C-terminal domains make contacts with their neighbouring N-terminal domain but have no contact with each other. Sequence searching15 identifies several homologues from various bacteria and archaea. Sequence alignment of these homologues shows that an extended loop (98\u2013114) in the N-terminal domain that is involved in the trimer contacts is missing in all homologues (Fig. 2a, b). In a model of the enzyme without this loop, the buried surface area is reduced by 25% and 8 of the 13 hydrogen bonds at each of the three trimer interfaces are deleted. Thus, although the superfamily shares the same monomeric fold, 5 0-FDAS may well have a unique quarternary structure. Crystallographic symmetry generates a hexamer (Fig. 2c), which is a dimer of the asymmetric unit trimer. Gel filtration indicates a hexamer11. The enzyme crystallized from S. cattleya contains a bound SAM molecule (Figs 2d and 3a), and SAM clearly does not dissociate readily from the protein during purification. SAM is bound at the interface between the C-terminal domain of one monomer and the N-terminal domain of the neighbouring monomer (Fig. 2b, d), and three molecules are bound by the trimer. The SAM molecule is completely buried by the protein on binding, which means that the protein must have an alternative open conformation during the turnover cycle. The recognition of SAM is highly specific (Figs 2d and 4). For ease of discussion, SAM can be decomposed into three components: the adenosine ring, the ribose ring and methionine. Each of these three components is recognized by a combination of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. All three components of SAM are recognized by both monomers, which indicates that the precise and possibly unique quarternary structure of the enzyme is crucial for substrate recognition and catalysis. It seems reasonable that the extensive contacts between SAM and the protein would drive closure of the domains to form the enveloped binding site. Notably, SAM is bound in a high-energy conformation, and the C2\u2013O2 and C3\u2013O3 bonds of the ribose ring are found in an eclipsed conformation (torsion angle 18). A search of the non-disordered well-refined entries in the small-molecule database16 with a furanose ring fragment query found only 1 ring from 264 possibilities that has a torsion angle for O2\u2013C2\u2013C3\u2013O3 within 108 of the angle seen here. An analysis of well-refined high-resolution (,2.0 A\u030a) protein structures17 shows that this torsion angle is always greater than 198 for the 15 SAM molecules in these structures. Molecular energy calculations indicate that this confor-mation relaxes on minimization with any of the common force fields (AMBER, MM2 and MM3)18. Observations from isotopic labelling19 in whole-cell experiments indicate that the fluorination reaction occurs with a stereochemical \u2018inversion of configuration\u2019 at the C5 0 carbon of SAM to generate Figure 3 Fo\u2013Fc electron density maps with phases calculated from models that do not include ligand.

To define the molecular mechanism, we grew crystals of the enzyme with the two products of the reaction. This was done by incubating SeMet protein with 50mM KF and 10mM SAM for 4 h before crystallization. The resulting crystals diffracted to 2.7 A\u030a and have essentially the same unit cell as the wild-type (SAM-bound) protein. The protein structure is identical to that observed for the SAM complex. It is immediately obvious from the electron density map that the SAM molecule is broken into two fragments (Fig. 3b). We built methionine and 5 0 -FDA into the density. The molecules are most clearly defined in the A subunit and reported distances relate to this subunit; however, the locations are essentially identical in all three subunits. Methionine is bound in a manner very similar to that observed in the SAM complex; the only difference is in the torsion angles (maximum 168) of the side chain, which results in a shift in the S and Ce atoms of 1.0 A\u030a between the two structures. A similar observation is made when comparing 5 0 -FDA and SAM, where the positions of the adenosine and the ribose ring are unchanged. The planarity of the ribose ring refines to a different value in 5 0 -FDA, because the C2\u2013O2 and C3\u2013O3 bonds are no longer eclipsed; however, the resolution of this structure precludes detailed analysis. The C5 0 atom of the ribose ring in the 5 0 -FDA complex has shifted by 0.8 A\u030a from its position in the SAM complex. The electron density clearly shows that the F atom is located in a pocket defined by a main chain stretch from Phe 156 to Ser 158 and the side chains of Phe 156, Tyr 77, Thr 80 and Ser 158 (Fig. 2e). There is a clear hydrogen bond (N\u2013F, 3.1 A\u030a) between the amide NHof Ser 158 and the F atom of the fluoromethyl group, which also makes a second polar contact with the side chain of Ser 158. It is well known that organic, bound fluorine is a relatively poor hydrogen-bonding acceptor20; however, the short contact here is very clear, suggesting an optimal NH\u2013F contact of 2.0 A\u030a (ref. 21). The pocket is unoccupied in the SAM complex and is hydrophobic in nature. There are no water molecules in the vicinity of the fluorine, which suggests that the F2 ion is fully dehydrated before C\u2013F bond formation. The radius of this pocket is roughly 1.4\u20131.6 A\u030a (assuming hydrogen atoms at their calculated positions with a van der Waals radius of 1.0 A\u030a), which would preferentially select the F2 ion and possibly water over the other halogens. This would explain the observation that 5 0 -FDAS does not use other halogens. Examination with the program HOLE22 does not find a convinc-ing channel that is wide enough to allow the F2 anion to diffuse into the active site when SAM is bound, indicating that F2may be bound first. Comparing the product and substrate complexes gives a distance between F (5 0-FDA) and C5 0 (SAM) of 1.9 A\u030a, aligns the C\u2013F bond of the product (5 0-FDA) anti (164 8) to the C5 0\u2013S bond of the substrate (SAM) and reveals only very small structural changes between substrate and complex. We regard this as extremely strong structural evidence for an SN2 mechanism (Fig. 4), with these structures representing the \u2018before and after\u2019. This is consistent with previous stereochemical data19. Implicit in this is the requisite that the F atom of the fluoromethyl group in 5 0-FDA is bound at the F2-binding site and secured by the same hydrogen-bonding contacts used to anchor F2. It is our interpretation that the high-energy conformation of the ribose ring is optimal for the nucleophilic substitution reaction mediated by the enzyme. The pucker in the ring will act as a force on C5 0 , weakening the C5 0 \u2013S bond. The conformation forces a F2 trajectory orthogonal to the C4\u2013O4 bond, minimizing electrostatic repulsion during the SN2 reaction. The inductive influence of the ring oxygen will strengthen the C5 0\u2013S bond (Fig. 4). O4 is pre-vented, however, by the ribose conformation from involvement in an anomeric interaction with the adenine ring and has no hydrogen bonds. Both these factors would substantially increase the inductive influence of O4 hindering the reaction. We note that O3 of SAM is hydrogen-bonded to Ser 158 OH, which contacts F2. Therefore, the position of O3 may be important for binding F2. SAM is extensively recognized, and its co-purification with the protein suggests that it is tightly bound. We predict that the SAM binding must drive the dehydration of F2 as it pushed into its binding pocket. Full desolvation of F2 would require roughly 400 kJmol21: a very high activation energy for the enzyme. Extra-polating from the fluoromethyl of the product structure, it seems that F2 makes polar contacts with the enzyme through a strong hydrogen bond to the backbone amide and a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the serine OH. It is clear that the enzyme uses these contacts to avoid having to pay the full free energy of desolvation. Thus 5 0-FDAS specifically dehydrates the F2 ion, making it a very potent nucleophile. The F2 ion is collinear with the C\u2013S bond of SAM, which the enzyme forces into a conformation designed to promote nucleophilic cleavage of the C\u2013S bond.

Three bases were changed (indicated by italics) in the primers to create NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined) for cloning. The ATG in the NdeI site is the start codon of the gene. The pSCF4 primer is located 50-bp downstream of the stop codon of the flA gene. The PCR product was inserted into the pET28a(\u00fe) vector (Novagen) between the NdeI and XhoI sites to generate pET28-flA. This plasmid directs the expression of FlA with a small His-tag-containing peptide (Met-Glu-Ser2-His6-Ser2-Glu-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Glu-Ser-His) fused to the N-terminal of the enzyme. E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET28-flA was grown in Luria broth containing 100 mgml21 kanamycin at 37 8C until an absorbance of 0.4\u20130.6 at 600 nmwas reached.We induced overexpression of FlA by adding isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) to 0.2mM and continued the incubation at 16 8C overnight. Cells were collected and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, the cell lysate was applied onto a column packed with Ni2\u00fe-charged His-Bind resin (Novagen). Recombinant protein bound on the resin was eluted with 20mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 250mM imidazole, 0.5M NaCl and 10% glycerol. The protein was further purified by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a Superdex S-200 (HR16/60) column (PharmaciaBiotech) and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience). We used Bradford reagent (BioRad) to measure protein concentrations. The M r of the protein was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel-filtration FPLC and ESI-MS analysis. Assay of the recombinant fluorination enzyme In a total reaction volume of 100ml, 15mg of FlAwas incubated with 0.8mM SAM, 10mM NaF and 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) at 37 8C for 3 h. The reaction product 5 0 -FDA was confirmed by liquid chromatograpymass spectrometry (LC-MS) using synthetic 5 0 -FDA10 as a standard. Crystallography Full details of the purification11 and crystallization of the enzyme from S. cattleya have been published elsewhere23. The 1.9-A\u030a data set was recorded on ID14-2 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The protein crystals were thought to be wild type, but on structure elucidation it became clear that SAM was bound. SeMet-labelled protein was produced by overexpression in E. coli by the methionine inhibition protocol24 and confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Crystals of 5 0 -FDA and methionine complex were obtained for SeMet protein under similar conditions to those used for the \u2018native\u2019 SAM crystals, except that the enzyme was first incubated with 50mM KF and 10mM SAM for 4 h. Data were collected at three wavelengths on BM14 UK at the ESRF and reduced with MOSFLM/SCALA25; full details are given in Table 1. SOLVE26 located 18 Se positions and generated phases. Automatic interpretation of electron density was done by combining the phases from the SeMet crystals with the isomorphous 1.9 A\u030a in Arp/wARP27. This procedure led to an essentially complete chain trace of the monomer. Both structures were refined by using REFMAC28 and statistics are given in Table 1. Dictionaries were derived from the PRODG server29; however, all torsion restraints were removed from the ribose ring to ensure a non-dictionary-biased conformation was obtained from refinement. Experimental data and structures have been deposited in the relevant data banks. Received 2 October; accepted 9 December 2003; doi:10.1038/nature02280. 1. O\u2019Hagan, D. & Harper, D. B.

Naismith1 1Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, The University of St Andrews, Fife KY16 9ST, UK 2University Chemical Laboratory, Lensfield Road, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK ............................................................................................................................................................................. Fluorine is the thirteenth most abundant element in the earth\u2019s crust, but fluoride concentrations in surface water are low and fluorinated metabolites are extremely rare1,2. The fluoride ion is a potent nucleophile in its desolvated state, but is tightly hydrated in water and effectively inert. Low availability and a lack of chemical reactivity have largely excluded fluoride from biochem-istry: in particular, fluorine\u2019s high redox potential precludes the haloperoxidase-type mechanism3,4 used in the metabolic incorporation of chloride and bromide ions. But fluorinated chemicals are growing in industrial importance, with appli-cations in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials pro-ducts5\u20137. Reactive fluorination reagents requiring specialist process technologies are needed in industry and, although biological catalysts for these processes are highly sought after, only one enzyme that can convert fluoride to organic fluorine has been described8. Streptomyces cattleya can form carbon\u2013fluorine bonds9 and must therefore have evolved an enzyme able to overcome the chemical challenges of using aqueous fluoride. Here we report the sequence and three-dimensional structure of the first native fluorination enzyme, 5 0 -fluoro-5 0 -deoxyadeno-sine synthase, from this organism. Both substrate and products have been observed bound to the enzyme, enabling us to propose a nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this biological fluori-nation reaction.",
        "When grown in the presence of F2 ions, S. cattleya secretes fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine, demonstrating its ability to biosynthesize organofluorine metabolites9. This organism contains an enzyme with a relative molecular mass (M r) of 32,200 that has been shown to catalyse the formation of a C\u2013F bond by combining S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and F2 to generate 5 0-fluoro-5 0-deoxyadenosine (5 0-FDA) and L-methionine (ref. 10 and Fig. 1).

        "The gene encoding 5 0-FDAS was cloned by degenerate polymer-ase chain reaction (PCR) on the basis of the partial protein sequence of the wild-type enzyme11 using genomic DNA from S. cattleya as a template. Sequence information obtained from the degenerate PCRs was used to determine the complete coding sequence (flA) for the enzyme. The flA gene is 897 base pairs (bp) in size and encodes a protein containing 299 amino acids. The flA gene amplified by PCR was inserted into the pET28a(\u00fe) plasmid and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The M r of the purified recombinant product of flA (Glu-Ser2-His6-Ser2-Glu-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Glu-Ser-His-FlA) was 34,402, in agreement with electronspray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data for the wild-type enzyme11.",
        "Crystallographic phases were determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) from the selenomethionine (SeMet)-containing enzyme. These phases were used to determine the structure of the wild-type enzyme purified from S. cattleya to 1.9 A\u030a. The refined structure contains residues 8\u2013298 from the total of 299 residues: the first seven and the last residue are not visible. The monomer is organized as an amino-terminal (residues 8\u2013180) and a smaller carboxy-terminal (residues 195\u2013298) domain (Fig. 2a). A distinctive, long, extended loop of 15 residues connects the two domains, which are otherwise linked by few interactions. No structural homologues were found for either domain by the SSM12 and the DALI13 queries, and thus there is no indication of an alternative or additional function.",
        "The N-terminal domain has a central seven-stranded b-sheet, which combines parallel and antiparallel strands sandwiched between a-helices (Fig. 2a). The C-terminal domain is composed of a five-and a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet. The Pfam database14 assigns the enzyme to family PF01887, and the structure provides the fold for this superfamily. Notably, no member of this superfamily has a known function. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a trimer (Fig. 2b): the three N-terminal domains are arranged around a three-fold axis and make intimate contacts with each other; the three C-terminal domains make contacts with their neighbouring N-terminal domain but have no contact with each other.",
        "Sequence searching15 identifies several homologues from various bacteria and archaea. Sequence alignment of these homologues shows that an extended loop (98\u2013114) in the N-terminal domain that is involved in the trimer contacts is missing in all homologues (Fig. 2a, b). In a model of the enzyme without this loop, the buried surface area is reduced by 25% and 8 of the 13 hydrogen bonds at each of the three trimer interfaces are deleted. Thus, although the superfamily shares the same monomeric fold, 5 0-FDAS may well have a unique quarternary structure. Crystallographic symmetry generates a hexamer (Fig. 2c), which is a dimer of the asymmetric unit trimer. Gel filtration indicates a hexamer11.",
        "The enzyme crystallized from S. cattleya contains a bound SAM molecule (Figs 2d and 3a), and SAM clearly does not dissociate readily from the protein during purification. SAM is bound at the interface between the C-terminal domain of one monomer and the N-terminal domain of the neighbouring monomer (Fig. 2b, d), and three molecules are bound by the trimer. The SAM molecule is completely buried by the protein on binding, which means that the protein must have an alternative open conformation during the turnover cycle. The recognition of SAM is highly specific (Figs 2d and 4). For ease of discussion, SAM can be decomposed into three components: the adenosine ring, the ribose ring and methionine. Each of these three components is recognized by a combination of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. All three components of SAM are recognized by both monomers, which indicates that the precise and possibly unique quarternary structure of the enzyme is crucial for substrate recognition and catalysis.",
        "It seems reasonable that the extensive contacts between SAM and the protein would drive closure of the domains to form the enveloped binding site. Notably, SAM is bound in a high-energy conformation, and the C2\u2013O2 and C3\u2013O3 bonds of the ribose ring are found in an eclipsed conformation (torsion angle 18). A search of the non-disordered well-refined entries in the small-molecule database16 with a furanose ring fragment query found only 1 ring from 264 possibilities that has a torsion angle for O2\u2013C2\u2013C3\u2013O3 within 108 of the angle seen here. An analysis of well-refined high-resolution (,2.0 A\u030a) protein structures17 shows that this torsion angle is always greater than 198 for the 15 SAM molecules in these structures. Molecular energy calculations indicate that this confor-mation relaxes on minimization with any of the common force fields (AMBER, MM2 and MM3)18.",

        "5 0 -FDA consistent with a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) process. To define the molecular mechanism, we grew crystals of the enzyme with the two products of the reaction. This was done by incubating SeMet protein with 50mM KF and 10mM SAM for 4 h before crystallization. The resulting crystals diffracted to 2.7 A\u030a and have essentially the same unit cell as the wild-type (SAM-bound) protein. The protein structure is identical to that observed for the SAM complex. It is immediately obvious from the electron density map that the SAM molecule is broken into two fragments (Fig. 3b). We built methionine and 5 0 -FDA into the density. The molecules are most clearly defined in the A subunit and reported distances relate to this subunit; however, the locations are essentially identical in all three subunits. Methionine is bound in a manner very similar to that observed in the SAM complex; the only difference is in the torsion angles (maximum 168) of the side chain, which results in a shift in the S and Ce atoms of 1.0 A\u030a between the two structures. A similar observation is made when comparing 5 0 -FDA and SAM, where the positions of the adenosine and the ribose ring are unchanged. The planarity of the ribose ring refines to a different value in 5 0 -FDA, because the C2\u2013O2 and C3\u2013O3 bonds are no longer eclipsed; however, the resolution of this structure precludes detailed analysis. The C5 0 atom of the ribose ring in the 5 0 -FDA complex has shifted by 0.8 A\u030a from its position in the SAM complex. The electron density clearly shows that the F atom is located in a pocket defined by a main chain stretch from Phe 156 to Ser 158 and the side chains of Phe 156, Tyr 77, Thr 80 and Ser 158 (Fig. 2e). There is a clear hydrogen bond (N\u2013F, 3.1 A\u030a) between the amide NHof Ser 158 and the F atom of the fluoromethyl group, which also makes a second polar contact with the side chain of Ser 158. It is well known that organic, bound fluorine is a relatively poor hydrogen-bonding acceptor20; however, the short contact here is very clear, suggesting an optimal NH\u2013F contact of 2.0 A\u030a (ref. 21). The pocket is unoccupied in the SAM complex and is hydrophobic in nature. There are no water molecules in the vicinity of the fluorine, which suggests that the F2 ion is fully dehydrated before C\u2013F bond formation. The radius of this pocket is roughly 1.4\u20131.6 A\u030a (assuming hydrogen atoms at their calculated positions with a van der Waals radius of 1.0 A\u030a), which would preferentially select the F2 ion and possibly water over the other halogens. This would explain the observation that 5 0 -FDAS does not use other halogens. Examination with the program HOLE22 does not find a convinc-ing channel that is wide enough to allow the F2 anion to diffuse into the active site when SAM is bound, indicating that F2may be bound first. Comparing the product and substrate complexes gives a distance between F (5 0-FDA) and C5 0 (SAM) of 1.9 A\u030a, aligns the C\u2013F bond of the product (5 0-FDA) anti (164 8) to the C5 0\u2013S bond of the substrate (SAM) and reveals only very small structural changes between substrate and complex. We regard this as extremely strong structural evidence for an SN2 mechanism (Fig. 4), with these structures representing the \u2018before and after\u2019. This is consistent with previous stereochemical data19. Implicit in this is the requisite that the F atom of the fluoromethyl group in 5 0-FDA is bound at the F2-binding site and secured by the same hydrogen-bonding contacts used to anchor F2. It is our interpretation that the high-energy conformation of the ribose ring is optimal for the nucleophilic substitution reaction mediated by the enzyme. The pucker in the ring will act as a force on C5 0 , weakening the C5 0 \u2013S bond. The conformation forces a F2 trajectory orthogonal to the C4\u2013O4 bond, minimizing electrostatic repulsion during the SN2 reaction. The inductive influence of the ring oxygen will strengthen the C5 0\u2013S bond (Fig. 4). O4 is pre-vented, however, by the ribose conformation from involvement in an anomeric interaction with the adenine ring and has no hydrogen bonds. Both these factors would substantially increase the inductive influence of O4 hindering the reaction. We note that O3 of SAM is hydrogen-bonded to Ser 158 OH, which contacts F2. Therefore, the position of O3 may be important for binding F2. SAM is extensively recognized, and its co-purification with the protein suggests that it is tightly bound. We predict that the SAM binding must drive the dehydration of F2 as it pushed into its binding pocket. Full desolvation of F2 would require roughly 400 kJmol21: a very high activation energy for the enzyme. Extra-polating from the fluoromethyl of the product structure, it seems that F2 makes polar contacts with the enzyme through a strong hydrogen bond to the backbone amide and a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the serine OH. It is clear that the enzyme uses these contacts to avoid having to pay the full free energy of desolvation. Thus 5 0-FDAS specifically dehydrates the F2 ion, making it a very potent nucleophile. The F2 ion is collinear with the C\u2013S bond of SAM, which the enzyme forces into a conformation designed to promote nucleophilic cleavage of the C\u2013S bond. Although no",

All primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotech. The PCR products were subcloned into pUC18 and sequenced. We used two primers, pSCF1 (5 0 -TGACGTCCGGGCAGATGCTG TACATGAGCCCCTTGCACT-3 0 ) and pSCF2 (5 0 -GAGGAGCACGGCTACCTGGAGGC GTACGAGGTCACCTCG-3 0 ), in further gene walking to identify the rest of the flA gene sequence. flA was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of S. cattleya using the primers pSCF3 (5 0 -GCAGGAGGAATTCATATGGCTGCCAACAGC-3 0 ) and pSCF4 (5 0 CCCTCACGCCGCTCGAGGGTACGTCGTCGC-3 0 ). Three bases were changed (indicated by italics) in the primers to create NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined) for cloning. The ATG in the NdeI site is the start codon of the gene. The pSCF4 primer is located 50-bp downstream of the stop codon of the flA gene. The PCR product was inserted into the pET28a(\u00fe) vector (Novagen) between the NdeI and XhoI sites to generate pET28-flA.

Cells were collected and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, the cell lysate was applied onto a column packed with Ni2\u00fe-charged His-Bind resin (Novagen). Recombinant protein bound on the resin was eluted with 20mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 250mM imidazole, 0.5M NaCl and 10% glycerol. The protein was further purified by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a Superdex S-200 (HR16/60) column (PharmaciaBiotech) and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience). We used Bradford reagent (BioRad) to measure protein concentrations. The M r of the protein was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel-filtration FPLC and ESI-MS analysis.
