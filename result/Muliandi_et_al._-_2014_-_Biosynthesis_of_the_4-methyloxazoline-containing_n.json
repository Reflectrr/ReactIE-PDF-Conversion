Sp080513GE-23 are nonribosomal peptides that possess an unusual 4-methyloxazoline moiety. Through draft genome sequencing, cosmid cloning, and gene disruption, the JBIR-34 and -35 biosyn-thesis gene cluster (fmo cluster) was identified; it encodes 20 proteins including five nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Disruption of one of these NRPS genes (fmoA3) resulted in no JBIR-34 and -35 production and accumulation of 6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid. Stable isotope-feeding experiments indicated that the methyl group of the methyloxazoline ring is derived from alanine rather than methionine. A recombinant FmoH pro-tein, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase ho-molog, catalyzed conversion of a-methyl-L-serine into D-alanine (the reverse reaction of a-methyl-L-serine synthesis catalyzed by FmoH in vivo). Taken together, we concluded that a-methyl-L-serine syn-thesized from D-alanine is incorporated into JBIR-34 and -35 to form the 4-methyloxazoline moiety. We also propose the biosynthesis pathway of JBIR-34 and -35. INTRODUCTION JBIR-34 and -35 (1 and 2) produced by Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 are small chlorinated nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) having aweak radical scavenging activity (Figure 1A;Mo-tohashi et al., 2010). These compounds possess a characteristic 4-methyloxazoline moiety, which is rarely found in natural prod-ucts. BE-32030 derivatives, which are inhibitors of cancer prolif-eration, are the only compounds that possess this moiety other than JBIR-34 and -35 (Figure 1B; Tsukamoto et al., 1997). Almost all of the methyloxazoline moieties observed in natural products are 5-methyloxazoline, which is derived from the proteinogenic amino acid, threonine. In contrast, the 4-methyloxazoline moi-Chemistry & Biology 21, 92 eties are probably derived from the nonproteinogenic amino acid, a-methylserine, or produced by methylation of oxazoline synthesized from serine. The similar five-membered ring, 4-methylthiazoline, which is found in the structures of yersinia-bactin (Figure 1C), hoiamides, largazoles, and thiazohalostatin, is synthesized via a-methylation of cysteine during peptide elon-gation (Patel et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2010; Ungermannova et al., 2012; Shindo et al., 1993). To date, however, there is no biosyn-thetic study on the origin of 4-methyloxazoline. NRPs, someofwhich have valuable bioactivities, are produced by awide variety of microorganisms. Pharmaceutically important antibiotics including vancomycin, daptomycin, and beta-lactam antibiotics belong to this class, which emphasizes the importance of NRPs in the industry (Martin, 2000; Walsh, 2004). They also attract interest because combinatorial biosynthesis can be applied for production of novel NRPs (Walsh, 2004). Typical nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) show modular structure, and each module is responsible for the condensation of one amino acid. One module is usually composed of three domains, condensation (C) domain, adenyla-tion (A) domain, and thiolation (T) domain. The T domain is a carrier protein containing a serine residue that is phosphopante-theinylated; an amino acid or a growing peptide is covalently attached to the phosphopantetheine arm via a thioester bond. The A domain is responsible for amino acid selection and catalyzes formation of a thioester bond between the phospho-pantetheine arm of the T domain and an amino acid substrate by consuming ATP. The C domain is responsible for the peptide bond formation between an amino acid attached to one Tdomain and the growing peptide (or an amino acid in the initial condensa-tion) attached to another T domain. Sometimes, a module con-tains an accessory enzyme domain such as methyltransferase (MT) domain and epimerization (E) domain to modify the growing peptide or amino acid before condensation. In some cases, the C domain is substituted by the heterocyclization (CYC) domain, catalyzing formation of the oxazoline or thiazoline ring. In the end, the synthesized peptide is cleaved off from the enzyme by the thioesterase (TE) domain, which catalyzes simple hydrolysis or macrocycle formation. This modular structure enabled engi-neering of NRPSs to produce various peptides by substituting A domains, which are responsible for amino acid selection. Nguyen et al.

Structures of the Compounds Chemistry & Biology Biosynthetic Origin of Unusual 4-Methyloxazoline determined by Marfey\u2019s method (Figure S1C; Bhushan and Bru\u0308ckner, 2004). Isolation of these chlorinated compounds sup-ported our hypothesis that chlorination of the indole moiety oc-curs at an early stage of the biosynthesis. These compounds seem to be intermediates released fromNRPSduring the peptide synthesis. The isolation of compound 4, which seems to be an intermediate before heterocyclization to form the 4-methyloxa-zoline moiety, suggests that the 4-methyloxazoline moiety is synthesized via a-methyl-L-serine, although it was not clear whether a-methyl-L-serine was used as a substrate of NRPS or synthesized bymethylation of L-serine during peptide elongation. Cloning and Sequencing of JBIR-34 and -35 Biosynthesis Gene Cluster First, we performed a draft genome sequencing of Strepto-myces sp. Sp080513GE-23. However, the quality was not good enough to reveal the entire sequence of the putative JBIR-34 and -35 biosynthesis gene cluster, which was later named fmo (four methyl oxazoline) cluster. Second, to clone and determine the accurate nucleotide sequence of the fmo gene cluster, we constructed a cosmid library of the genomic DNA of Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 using pTOYAMA-cos (Onaka et al., 2003). Using a flavin-dependent halogenase gene (fmoD), which was discovered by the draft genome sequence, as a probe for colony hybridization, we obtained a cosmid (pTOYAMAcos cl. 15) carrying part of the fmo gene cluster. Next, we obtained another cosmid (pTOYAMAcos C56) carrying the remaining part of the fmo gene cluster by colony hybridization using an NRPS gene (fmoA5) as a probe, which is included in the insert fragment of pTOYAMAcos cl.15. Then, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the inserts of these two cosmids, to reveal the entire sequence of the fmo gene cluster (Table 1 and Figure 2). To prove by heterologous expression that the fmo gene cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of JBIR-34 and -35, we constructed a cosmid (pTJ34-3) carrying the entire fmo gene cluster (see Supple-mental Experimental Information). However, we could not observe heterologous production of JBIR-34 or -35 by Strep-tomyces lividans or Streptomyces albus harboring pTJ34-3. Therefore, we disrupted fmoA3 encoding an NRPS in Strepto-myces sp. Sp080513GE-23 (Figure S2). The DfmoA3 mutant did not produce both JBIR-34 and -35 (Figure 3), which clearly showed that this gene cluster is responsible for their biosyn-thesis. Furthermore, the DfmoA3 mutant produced a larger amount of compound 3 (approximately 0.3 mg/l) than the wild-type strain (approximately 0.1 mg/l), which suggested that this compound was the priming unit for the NRP synthe-sis. The wild-type strain produced approximately 7 and 2 mg/l of JBIR-34 and -35, respectively, and the amount of compound 3 produced by the DfmoA3 mutant was therefore much lower than expected. This result may be attributed to the product inhibition of the enzyme involved in the biosyn-thesis of compound 3. The DfmoA3 mutant showed normal growth and morphological development on ISP2 agar (data not shown). In Silico Analysis of NRPSs and Related Enzymes Topredict the biosynthesis pathway of JBIR-34 and -35, proteins encoded by the fmo cluster were analyzed in silico. FmoA1 is Chemistry & Biology 21, 92 composed of an A-T didomain. Using NRPSpredictor2 (http:// nrps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/Controller?cmd=SubmitJob; Ro\u0308ttig et al., 2011), theAdomainwaspredicted to recognize tryp-tophan. Importantly, FmoA1 showed significant similarity to several didomain NRPSs, such as SimH (36% identity) from the simocyclinone biosynthesis gene cluster (Galm et al., 2002), NovH (35%) from the novobiocin biosynthesis gene cluster (Stef-fensky et al., 2000;Chen andWalsh, 2001), andNikP1 (32%) from the nikkomycin biosynthesis gene cluster (Chen et al., 2002). These NRPSs were predicted or proved to be responsible for b-hydroxylation of tyrosine or histidine in collaboration with a cytochrome P450, which is encoded by a gene adjacent to the NRPS genes. Furthermore, the fmoA1 gene is located adjacent to fmoC that encodes a putative cytochrome P450 showing similarity to NikQ (39%), SimI (37%), and NovI (33%), which were predicted or proved to catalyze b-hydroxylation of amino acids attached to T domain. Thus, FmoA1 and FmoC are likely to be responsible for b-hydroxylation of tryptophan or its deriva-tive. The resulting b-hydroxyamino acid can be cleaved to give an aldehyde and glycine by a threonine aldolase-catalyzed retro-aldol reaction (di Salvo et al., 2014). The resulting aldehyde can be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid by an aldehyde dehy-drogenase (Kostichka et al., 2001). FmoM and FmoI, which are threonine aldolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase homologs, respectively, appeared to be responsible for these reactions, and it was therefore highly likely that FmoA1 was involved in the biosynthesis of compound 3 (6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-car-boxylic acid), which is the putative priming unit for the NRP synthesis. FmoA2 is composed of A, T, and CYC domains followed by an MT domain. FmoA3 possesses CYC, A, and T domains. Because these enzymes possess a CYC domain, they are likely to be responsible for the formation of the methyloxazoline group. However, the A domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 were predicted by the NRPSpredictor2 to recognize alanine and cysteine, respectively. According to the domain structure of FmoA2 and FmoA3, we postulated two possible biosynthesis pathways for 4-methyloxazoline. In the first hypothesis,N-(6-chloro-4-hydrox-yindole-3-carboxyl)-L-serinyl-T domain is synthesized from 6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid (3) and L-serine by FmoA2 and FmoA3. This compound is then methylated by the MT domain of FmoA2 to synthesize N-(6-chloro-4-hydroxyin-dole-3-carboxyl)-a-methyl-L-serinyl-T domain, which is further heterocyclized by the CYC domains of FmoA2 and/or FmoA3 to form the 4-methyloxazoline moiety. This pathway is similar to that for 4-methylthiazoline formation in the biosynthesis of yersiniabactin (Patel et al., 2003). In the second hypothesis, N-(6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxyl)-a-methyl-L-serinyl-T domain is synthesized directly from 6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid (3) and a-methyl-L-serine by FmoA2 and FmoA3. a-Methyl-L-serine may be synthesized from alanine by FmoH, a homolog of AmiS (58.2%), BAG31000 (41.3%), and BAG31001 (41.3%; Zhang et al., 2012; Nozaki et al., 2008, 2009). FmoA4 is composed of C, A, T, and MT domains. This A domain was predicted by the NRPSpredictor2 to incorporate isoleucine, but this prediction is not consistent with the struc-tures of JBIR-34 and -35. Because FmoA4 contains neither CYC domain nor TE domain, it is not likely to be involved in oxazoline ring formation or the last peptide bond formation. 3\u2013934, August 14, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 925 Table 1.

Biosynthesis Gene Cluster of JBIR-34 and -35 Chemistry & Biology Biosynthetic Origin of Unusual 4-Methyloxazoline bond in the JBIR-34 and -35 biosynthesis. This is consistent with the NRPSpredictor2 prediction; according to the structures of JBIR-34 and -35, serine should be the last amino acid to be incorporated. The two TE domains were subjected to phyloge-netic analysis with various type I and type II TE domains, accord-ing to the procedure reported by Buntin et al. (2010), in an attempt to predict their functions (Figure S3). Type I TE is gener-ally responsible for the release of a fully elongated peptide from the enzyme, whereas type II TE is involved in the \u2018\u2018proofreading\u2019\u2019 of the peptide during the elongation process, i.e., the cleavage of any mistakenly loaded acyl moieties from the T domain (Koglin et al., 2008). The phylogenetic tree showed that the TE domain closer to the N terminus belonged to a clade composed of type I TE domains from the NRPSs involved in the biosynthesis of albicidin and thailandamide (Royer et al., 2004; Ishida et al., 2010), whereas the TE domain closer to the C terminus belonged to a clade which mainly contained type II TEs. This result sug-gested that these two TEs performed different functions in the biosynthesis of JBIR-34 and -35. The observation that FmoA5 possessed a putative type II TE domain in cis was particularly interesting, because most type II TEs exist in trans (Koglin et al., 2008). FmoA5 also possessed two T domains, which both had a conserved Ser residue that was capable of binding to phosphopantetheine. It was difficult to predict which T domain was involved in the peptide elongation process. As described above, the prediction of the substrate specificity of more than half of the A domains did not match with the struc-tures of JBIR-34 and -35. These A domains may select unusual amino acids, which would make it difficult for the NRPSpredic-tor2 to predict the genuine amino acid substrate. The C domains of FmoA4 and FmoA5were analyzed by phylo-genetic analysis according to the procedure reported by Rausch et al. (2007). We found that both of them belong to the LCL domain, which catalyzes peptide bond formation between two L-amino acids (data not shown). Feeding of [Methyl-13C]-Methionine and [3-13C]-Alanine To deduce the biosynthetic origin of the methyl group of the methyloxazoline moiety, we carried out feeding experiments us-ing a stable isotope. Prior to the feeding experiments, we analyzed JBIR-34 with high-resolution tandem mass spectrom-etry (HR-MS/MS) and observed three major fragments, A (m/ z = 348.1106 [M + H]+), B (m/z = 277.0735 [M + H]+), and C (m/ z = 222.0315 [M + H]+; Figure S4A). Importantly, each fragment showed an ion that was 2 Da larger than the corresponding monoisotopic ion (the difference came from 37Cl), demonstrating that each fragment contained chloride. Based on this result, we determined the molecular formulas of the fragments: A, C17H19ClN3O3 +; B, C14H14ClN2O2 +; and C, C11H9ClNO2 +. Furthermore, taking the structure of JBIR-34 into consideration, Chemistry & Biology 21, 92 we concluded that fragment A is generated by a type cleavage of the amide bond between serine and alanine (Figure S4B). Similarly, fragment B is generated by a type cleavage of the amide bond between alanine and methyloxazoline (Figure S4B). Fragment C is derived from the hydrolysis of themethyloxazoline moiety followed by b type cleavage of the peptide bond (Fig-ure S4B). We also observed a similar fragmentation pattern of JBIR-35 (Figures S4C and S4D). Thus, we concluded that incorporation of 13C into the methyloxazoline moiety could be detected by comparing the isotopic composition of fragments B and C. We initially expected that the methyl group of the methyloxa-zoline moiety would be synthesized by a SAM-dependent meth-yltransferase (for example, the MT domain of FmoA2), because the methylthiazoline moiety in yersiniabactin has been predicted to be synthesized via methylation of cysteine catalyzed by the MT domain of NRPS (Patel et al., 2003). To test this, [meth-yl-13C]-methionine was added to the medium and incubated with Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23. The resulting JBIR-34 was analyzed by HR-MS/MS to examine the incorporation of 13C. The m/z value of the parent ion [M + H]+ of JBIR-34 increased from 481.1473 to 483.1546, suggesting that two 13C atoms were incorporated into the peptide (Figure S4E). The MS data suggested that almost all of the JBIR-34 had been labeled with two 13C atoms. Furthermore, the m/z values of the A, B, and C fragments increased by 2, which was consistent with the incorporation of two 13C atoms. In contrast to our expec-tation, this result indicated that the two methyl groups of the indole chromophore came from methionine, and that the methyl group of the 4-methyloxazoline ring was not derived from methi-onine (Figure S4E). Next, we hypothesized that the methyloxazoline moiety may be formed by heterocyclization of a-methyl-L-serine, which could be synthesized from D-alanine by FmoH, a homolog of AmiS in the amicetin biosynthesis (Zhang et al., 2012). To test our second hypothesis, we fed [3-13C]-L-alanine, which seems to be easily converted to [3-13C]-D-alanine in vivo, to Strepto-myces sp. Sp080513GE-23. The produced JBIR-34 was analyzed by HR-MS/MS to examine the incorporation of 13C. The parent ion of JBIR-34 showed several peaks in addition to the native peaks; there were two strong peaks corresponding to two ions that were 1 and 2 Da larger than the monoisotopic parent ion (Figure S4F). This result suggested that two alanine molecules could be incorporated into JBIR-34. Analysis by mass spectroscopy revealed that approximately 46% and 39% of the JBIR-34 had been labeled with one and two 13C atoms, respectively. Fragment A also showed a similar isotopic compo-sition to the parent ion (Figure S4F). In contrast, fragment B showed a different isotopic composition from the parent ion and fragment A; approximately 58% and 6% of JBIR-34 were 3\u2013934, August 14, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 927 A bs or ba nc e un it at  300  nm  [AU ] 0.3 0 0.3 0 020 RT [min]1 2 3 wild type\u0394fmoA3 mutantA B 10 Figure 3.

Proposed Biosynthesis Pathway of JBIR-34 and -35 Chemistry & Biology Biosynthetic Origin of Unusual 4-Methyloxazoline NRPS responsible for amicetin biosynthesis (Figure S6). Although these strains are not known to produce peptides con-taining a-methyl-L-serine, this bioinformatic analysis suggests that these strains may be potential producers of such peptides, and that NRPs containing a-methyl-L-serine may be produced by a broader range of organisms than expected. The FmoH-based genome mining may result in the discovery of novel com-pounds containing an a-methyl-L-serine moiety. SIGNIFICANCE In this study, we identified the biosynthetic origin of the unusual 4-methyloxazoline moiety of JBIR-34 and -35 as a-methyl-L-serine. We showed that the A domain of FmoA3 recognizes a-methyl-L-serine. Because the ability of NRPSs to utilize nonproteinogenic amino acids is important for the structural diversity of NRPs, this study will open the way for synthesizing novel NRPs by genetic engineering of NRPSs. We also revealed that FmoH, a glycine/serine hydroxyme-thyltransferase homolog, catalyzed the conversion between D-alanine and a-methyl-L-serine, indicating that FmoH func-tions as an a-methyl-L-serine synthase. Our in vitro analysis of FmoH is a characterization of a-methyl-L-serine synthase that correlates with NRP biosynthesis. Identification of the a-methyl-L-serine-recognizing A domain and a-methyl-L-serine synthase will facilitate genomemining of novel NRPs. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Isolation and Characterization of Compounds 3 and 4 Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 was inoculated into 100 ml of ISP-2 me-dium (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and incubated at 30NoneC for 2 days. A portion (20 ml) of the culture was transferred into 1 l of ISP-2 medium and further incubated at 30NoneC for 5 days. Then, 20 g of HP20 was added to the culture and stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The mixture of cells and HP20 was harvested by centrifugation, and then extracted with methanol. The extract was evaporated to dryness. The residual materials were applied to medium pressure liquid chromatography (Purif-Compact A, Shoko Scientific) equipped with an ODS column (Purif-Pack ODS, SIZE60, Shoko Scientific). Compounds were eluted using linear gradient from solvent A (10%methanol containing 0.1% formic acid) to solvent B (methanol contain-ing 0.1% formic acid). The fractions containing compounds 3 and 4 were evaporated to dryness, and compounds 3 and 4 in the residual material were further purified by high performance liquid chromatography equipped with COSMOSIL C18-AR-II (10 mm 3 250 mm). The compounds were eluted with a linear gradient of 50%\u2013100% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, resulting in 1.1 mg of compound 3 and 0.6 mg of compound 4. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra of compound 3 were re-corded in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 on a JNM-A500 NMR System (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra of compound 4 were recorded in DMSO-d6 on a Varian 600 NB CL NMR System (Varian). Construction of the Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 DfmoA3 Mutant A PCR targeting system using the cosmid pTJ34-3 carrying the gene cluster was used to construct the deletion mutant. The pKGLP2 vector carrying a beta-glucuronidase as a selection marker (Myronovskyi et al., 2011) was used. The details are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Production, Extraction, and LC-ESI MS Analysis of JBIR-34 and -35 Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 or the DfmoA3mutant was inoculated into 10ml ISP-2medium and incubated at 30NoneC for 2 days.

The supernatant was extracted with ethyl acetate three times and further extracted with butanol twice. The butanol layer was evaporated to dryness and the residual material was dissolved in 200 ml of DMSO for liquid chromatography-electron spray ionization mass spectrom-etry (LC-ESI MS) analysis. LC-ESI MS was carried out using Agilent 1100 series (Agilent Technologies) and the high-capacity trap plus system (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a MonoBis column (2 3 50 mm; Kyoto Monotech). The compounds were eluted with a linear gradient using water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as themobile phase. The amounts of JBIR-34 and -35 and compound 3 were estimated by integrating the corresponding peak areas in the chromatogram (absorbance unit at 300 nm) and comparing these values to those of the purified samples. Feeding Experiments Using [Methyl-13C]-L-Methionine and [3-13C]-L-Alanine [Methyl-13C]-L-methionine and [3-13C]-L-alanine were purchased from ISOTEC and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, respectively. Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 was inoculated into 10 ml ISP-2 medium and incubated at 30NoneC for 2 days. Fifty microliters of the culture were transferred to fresh 5 ml ISP-2 medium containing 2 g/l of [methyl-13C]-L-methionine or [3-13C]-L-alanine and further incubated at 30NoneC for 5 days. The supernatant was ex-tracted with ethyl acetate three times and further extracted with butanol twice. The butanol layer was evaporated to dryness and the residual material was dissolved in 200 ml of DMSO for LC-ESI MS analysis. LC-ESI MS was carried out as described previously. HR-MS/MS analysis was carried out usingWaters SYNAPT G2 (Waters). Expression and Purification of FmoH pET28a-fmoH was constructed by cloning the fmoH gene amplified by PCR into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET28a. From the E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET28a-fmoH, FmoH fused N-terminally with a histidine tag was purified as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. In Vitro Assay of FmoH The standard reaction mixture (100 ml) contained 2 mM of FmoH, 1 mM sub-strate, 0.5 mM THF, 10 mM PLP, and 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). After incubation at 30NoneC for 1 hr, the reaction was quenched by adding 100 ml of methanol (for FDLA derivatization) or acetonitrile (for 9-fluorenylme-thyloxycarbonyl derivatization). After derivatization was performed as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, the products were analyzed with LC-ESI MS equippedwith aMonoBis column (23 50mm; Kyoto Monotech). Compounds were eluted with a linear gradient using water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. For the analysis of the kinetic parameters, the reactionmixture (50 ml) containing 4 mMof FmoH, different concentrations of a-methyl-L-serine (varied in the range of 50\u20132,000 mM), 0.5 mM THF, 20 mM PLP, and 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) was incubated at 30NoneC for 5 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 ml of acetonitrile. The 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl derivatives were then analyzed with LC-ESI MS, and the yields were estimated by comparing the peak areas with those of the authentic standards. The kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the substrate concentration-initial veloc-ity plot to the equitation Vmax*[S]/(Km+[S]). Expression and Purification of FmoA Proteins The DNA fragments encoding whole fmoA1, fmoA2, fmoA3, fmoA4, and fmoA5 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pColdI (Takara), resulting in pColdI-fmoA1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. From the E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring one of these plasmids, each FmoA fused N-terminally with a histidine tag was purified as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. In Vitro Analysis of Adenylating Activity Each FmoA protein (1 mM) was incubated with 5 mM possible substrates in 80 ml of buffer containing 150 mM hydroxylamine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 U/ ml pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 0.5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Hydroxylamine solution was prepared according to the method reported by Kadi and Challis (2009). The reaction mixture was prein-cubated for 2 min, and the reaction was initiated by adding ATP. After 30-min incubation, the reaction was quenched by adding 20 ml of working er Ltd All rights reserved Chemistry & Biology Biosynthetic Origin of Unusual 4-Methyloxazoline reagent of malachite green phosphate assay kit (BioAssay Systems). After a 1.5-hr incubation at room temperature, absorption at 620 nm (A620) was measured. We subtracted the A620 value of the reaction mixture with no sub-strate from the A620 value of a reaction mixture containing the substrate to estimate the relative adenylation activity.

        "SUMMARY",
        "JBIR-34 and -35 produced by Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 are nonribosomal peptides that possess an unusual 4-methyloxazoline moiety. Through draft genome sequencing, cosmid cloning, and gene disruption, the JBIR-34 and -35 biosyn-thesis gene cluster (fmo cluster) was identified; it encodes 20 proteins including five nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Disruption of one of these NRPS genes (fmoA3) resulted in no JBIR-34 and -35 production and accumulation of 6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid. Stable isotope-feeding experiments indicated that the methyl group of the methyloxazoline ring is derived from alanine rather than methionine. A recombinant FmoH pro-tein, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase ho-molog, catalyzed conversion of a-methyl-L-serine into D-alanine (the reverse reaction of a-methyl-L-serine synthesis catalyzed by FmoH in vivo). Taken together, we concluded that a-methyl-L-serine syn-thesized from D-alanine is incorporated into JBIR-34 and -35 to form the 4-methyloxazoline moiety. We also propose the biosynthesis pathway of JBIR-34 and -35.",
        "INTRODUCTION",
        "JBIR-34 and -35 (1 and 2) produced by Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 are small chlorinated nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) having aweak radical scavenging activity (Figure 1A;Mo-tohashi et al., 2010). These compounds possess a characteristic 4-methyloxazoline moiety, which is rarely found in natural prod-ucts. BE-32030 derivatives, which are inhibitors of cancer prolif-eration, are the only compounds that possess this moiety other than JBIR-34 and -35 (Figure 1B; Tsukamoto et al., 1997). Almost all of the methyloxazoline moieties observed in natural products are 5-methyloxazoline, which is derived from the proteinogenic amino acid, threonine. In contrast, the 4-methyloxazoline moi-",
        "Chemistry & Biology 21, 92",
        "eties are probably derived from the nonproteinogenic amino acid, a-methylserine, or produced by methylation of oxazoline synthesized from serine. The similar five-membered ring, 4-methylthiazoline, which is found in the structures of yersinia-bactin (Figure 1C), hoiamides, largazoles, and thiazohalostatin, is synthesized via a-methylation of cysteine during peptide elon-gation (Patel et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2010; Ungermannova et al., 2012; Shindo et al., 1993). To date, however, there is no biosyn-thetic study on the origin of 4-methyloxazoline.",
        "NRPs, someofwhich have valuable bioactivities, are produced by awide variety of microorganisms. Pharmaceutically important antibiotics including vancomycin, daptomycin, and beta-lactam antibiotics belong to this class, which emphasizes the importance of NRPs in the industry (Martin, 2000; Walsh, 2004). They also attract interest because combinatorial biosynthesis can be applied for production of novel NRPs (Walsh, 2004). Typical nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) show modular structure, and each module is responsible for the condensation of one amino acid. One module is usually composed of three domains, condensation (C) domain, adenyla-tion (A) domain, and thiolation (T) domain. The T domain is a carrier protein containing a serine residue that is phosphopante-theinylated; an amino acid or a growing peptide is covalently attached to the phosphopantetheine arm via a thioester bond. The A domain is responsible for amino acid selection and catalyzes formation of a thioester bond between the phospho-pantetheine arm of the T domain and an amino acid substrate by consuming ATP. The C domain is responsible for the peptide bond formation between an amino acid attached to one Tdomain and the growing peptide (or an amino acid in the initial condensa-tion) attached to another T domain. Sometimes, a module con-tains an accessory enzyme domain such as methyltransferase (MT) domain and epimerization (E) domain to modify the growing peptide or amino acid before condensation. In some cases, the C domain is substituted by the heterocyclization (CYC) domain, catalyzing formation of the oxazoline or thiazoline ring. In the end, the synthesized peptide is cleaved off from the enzyme by the thioesterase (TE) domain, which catalyzes simple hydrolysis or macrocycle formation. This modular structure enabled engi-neering of NRPSs to produce various peptides by substituting A domains, which are responsible for amino acid selection. Nguyen et al.

        "determined by Marfey\u2019s method (Figure S1C; Bhushan and Bru\u0308ckner, 2004). Isolation of these chlorinated compounds sup-ported our hypothesis that chlorination of the indole moiety oc-curs at an early stage of the biosynthesis. These compounds seem to be intermediates released fromNRPSduring the peptide synthesis. The isolation of compound 4, which seems to be an intermediate before heterocyclization to form the 4-methyloxa-zoline moiety, suggests that the 4-methyloxazoline moiety is synthesized via a-methyl-L-serine, although it was not clear whether a-methyl-L-serine was used as a substrate of NRPS or synthesized bymethylation of L-serine during peptide elongation.",

However, the quality was not good enough to reveal the entire sequence of the putative JBIR-34 and -35 biosynthesis gene cluster, which was later named fmo (four methyl oxazoline) cluster. Second, to clone and determine the accurate nucleotide sequence of the fmo gene cluster, we constructed a cosmid library of the genomic DNA of Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 using pTOYAMA-cos (Onaka et al., 2003). Using a flavin-dependent halogenase gene (fmoD), which was discovered by the draft genome sequence, as a probe for colony hybridization, we obtained a cosmid (pTOYAMAcos cl. 15) carrying part of the fmo gene cluster. Next, we obtained another cosmid (pTOYAMAcos C56) carrying the remaining part of the fmo gene cluster by colony hybridization using an NRPS gene (fmoA5) as a probe, which is included in the insert fragment of pTOYAMAcos cl.15. Then, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the inserts of these two cosmids, to reveal the entire sequence of the fmo gene cluster (Table 1 and Figure 2). To prove by heterologous expression that the fmo gene cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of JBIR-34 and -35, we constructed a cosmid (pTJ34-3) carrying the entire fmo gene cluster (see Supple-mental Experimental Information). However, we could not observe heterologous production of JBIR-34 or -35 by Strep-tomyces lividans or Streptomyces albus harboring pTJ34-3. Therefore, we disrupted fmoA3 encoding an NRPS in Strepto-myces sp. Sp080513GE-23 (Figure S2). The DfmoA3 mutant did not produce both JBIR-34 and -35 (Figure 3), which clearly showed that this gene cluster is responsible for their biosyn-thesis. Furthermore, the DfmoA3 mutant produced a larger amount of compound 3 (approximately 0.3 mg/l) than the wild-type strain (approximately 0.1 mg/l), which suggested that this compound was the priming unit for the NRP synthe-sis. The wild-type strain produced approximately 7 and 2 mg/l of JBIR-34 and -35, respectively, and the amount of compound 3 produced by the DfmoA3 mutant was therefore much lower than expected. This result may be attributed to the product inhibition of the enzyme involved in the biosyn-thesis of compound 3. The DfmoA3 mutant showed normal growth and morphological development on ISP2 agar (data not shown).",
        "In Silico Analysis of NRPSs and Related Enzymes Topredict the biosynthesis pathway of JBIR-34 and -35, proteins encoded by the fmo cluster were analyzed in silico. FmoA1 is",

        "composed of an A-T didomain. Using NRPSpredictor2 (http:// nrps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/Controller?cmd=SubmitJob; Ro\u0308ttig et al., 2011), theAdomainwaspredicted to recognize tryp-tophan. Importantly, FmoA1 showed significant similarity to several didomain NRPSs, such as SimH (36% identity) from the simocyclinone biosynthesis gene cluster (Galm et al., 2002), NovH (35%) from the novobiocin biosynthesis gene cluster (Stef-fensky et al., 2000;Chen andWalsh, 2001), andNikP1 (32%) from the nikkomycin biosynthesis gene cluster (Chen et al., 2002). These NRPSs were predicted or proved to be responsible for b-hydroxylation of tyrosine or histidine in collaboration with a cytochrome P450, which is encoded by a gene adjacent to the NRPS genes. Furthermore, the fmoA1 gene is located adjacent to fmoC that encodes a putative cytochrome P450 showing similarity to NikQ (39%), SimI (37%), and NovI (33%), which were predicted or proved to catalyze b-hydroxylation of amino acids attached to T domain. Thus, FmoA1 and FmoC are likely to be responsible for b-hydroxylation of tryptophan or its deriva-tive. The resulting b-hydroxyamino acid can be cleaved to give an aldehyde and glycine by a threonine aldolase-catalyzed retro-aldol reaction (di Salvo et al., 2014). The resulting aldehyde can be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid by an aldehyde dehy-drogenase (Kostichka et al., 2001). FmoM and FmoI, which are threonine aldolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase homologs, respectively, appeared to be responsible for these reactions, and it was therefore highly likely that FmoA1 was involved in the biosynthesis of compound 3 (6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-car-boxylic acid), which is the putative priming unit for the NRP synthesis.",
        "FmoA2 is composed of A, T, and CYC domains followed by an MT domain. FmoA3 possesses CYC, A, and T domains. Because these enzymes possess a CYC domain, they are likely to be responsible for the formation of the methyloxazoline group. However, the A domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 were predicted by the NRPSpredictor2 to recognize alanine and cysteine, respectively. According to the domain structure of FmoA2 and FmoA3, we postulated two possible biosynthesis pathways for 4-methyloxazoline. In the first hypothesis,N-(6-chloro-4-hydrox-yindole-3-carboxyl)-L-serinyl-T domain is synthesized from 6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid (3) and L-serine by FmoA2 and FmoA3. This compound is then methylated by the MT domain of FmoA2 to synthesize N-(6-chloro-4-hydroxyin-dole-3-carboxyl)-a-methyl-L-serinyl-T domain, which is further heterocyclized by the CYC domains of FmoA2 and/or FmoA3 to form the 4-methyloxazoline moiety. This pathway is similar to that for 4-methylthiazoline formation in the biosynthesis of yersiniabactin (Patel et al., 2003). In the second hypothesis, N-(6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxyl)-a-methyl-L-serinyl-T domain is synthesized directly from 6-chloro-4-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid (3) and a-methyl-L-serine by FmoA2 and FmoA3. a-Methyl-L-serine may be synthesized from alanine by FmoH, a homolog of AmiS (58.2%), BAG31000 (41.3%), and BAG31001 (41.3%; Zhang et al., 2012; Nozaki et al., 2008, 2009).",
        "FmoA4 is composed of C, A, T, and MT domains. This A domain was predicted by the NRPSpredictor2 to incorporate isoleucine, but this prediction is not consistent with the struc-tures of JBIR-34 and -35. Because FmoA4 contains neither CYC domain nor TE domain, it is not likely to be involved in oxazoline ring formation or the last peptide bond formation. 3\u2013934, August 14, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 925",

        "bond in the JBIR-34 and -35 biosynthesis. This is consistent with the NRPSpredictor2 prediction; according to the structures of JBIR-34 and -35, serine should be the last amino acid to be incorporated. The two TE domains were subjected to phyloge-netic analysis with various type I and type II TE domains, accord-ing to the procedure reported by Buntin et al. (2010), in an attempt to predict their functions (Figure S3). Type I TE is gener-ally responsible for the release of a fully elongated peptide from the enzyme, whereas type II TE is involved in the \u2018\u2018proofreading\u2019\u2019 of the peptide during the elongation process, i.e., the cleavage of any mistakenly loaded acyl moieties from the T domain (Koglin et al., 2008). The phylogenetic tree showed that the TE domain closer to the N terminus belonged to a clade composed of type I TE domains from the NRPSs involved in the biosynthesis of albicidin and thailandamide (Royer et al., 2004; Ishida et al., 2010), whereas the TE domain closer to the C terminus belonged to a clade which mainly contained type II TEs. This result sug-gested that these two TEs performed different functions in the biosynthesis of JBIR-34 and -35. The observation that FmoA5 possessed a putative type II TE domain in cis was particularly interesting, because most type II TEs exist in trans (Koglin et al., 2008). FmoA5 also possessed two T domains, which both had a conserved Ser residue that was capable of binding to phosphopantetheine. It was difficult to predict which T domain was involved in the peptide elongation process.",
        "As described above, the prediction of the substrate specificity of more than half of the A domains did not match with the struc-tures of JBIR-34 and -35. These A domains may select unusual amino acids, which would make it difficult for the NRPSpredic-tor2 to predict the genuine amino acid substrate.",
        "The C domains of FmoA4 and FmoA5were analyzed by phylo-genetic analysis according to the procedure reported by Rausch et al. (2007). We found that both of them belong to the LCL domain, which catalyzes peptide bond formation between two L-amino acids (data not shown).",
        "Feeding of [Methyl-13C]-Methionine and [3-13C]-Alanine To deduce the biosynthetic origin of the methyl group of the methyloxazoline moiety, we carried out feeding experiments us-ing a stable isotope. Prior to the feeding experiments, we analyzed JBIR-34 with high-resolution tandem mass spectrom-etry (HR-MS/MS) and observed three major fragments, A (m/ z = 348.1106 [M + H]+), B (m/z = 277.0735 [M + H]+), and C (m/ z = 222.0315 [M + H]+; Figure S4A). Importantly, each fragment showed an ion that was 2 Da larger than the corresponding monoisotopic ion (the difference came from 37Cl), demonstrating that each fragment contained chloride. Based on this result, we determined the molecular formulas of the fragments: A, C17H19ClN3O3 +; B, C14H14ClN2O2 +; and C, C11H9ClNO2 +. Furthermore, taking the structure of JBIR-34 into consideration,",
        "Chemistry & Biology 21, 92",
        "we concluded that fragment A is generated by a type cleavage of the amide bond between serine and alanine (Figure S4B). Similarly, fragment B is generated by a type cleavage of the amide bond between alanine and methyloxazoline (Figure S4B). Fragment C is derived from the hydrolysis of themethyloxazoline moiety followed by b type cleavage of the peptide bond (Fig-ure S4B). We also observed a similar fragmentation pattern of JBIR-35 (Figures S4C and S4D). Thus, we concluded that incorporation of 13C into the methyloxazoline moiety could be detected by comparing the isotopic composition of fragments B and C.",
        "We initially expected that the methyl group of the methyloxa-zoline moiety would be synthesized by a SAM-dependent meth-yltransferase (for example, the MT domain of FmoA2), because the methylthiazoline moiety in yersiniabactin has been predicted to be synthesized via methylation of cysteine catalyzed by the MT domain of NRPS (Patel et al., 2003). To test this, [meth-yl-13C]-methionine was added to the medium and incubated with Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23. The resulting JBIR-34 was analyzed by HR-MS/MS to examine the incorporation of 13C. The m/z value of the parent ion [M + H]+ of JBIR-34 increased from 481.1473 to 483.1546, suggesting that two 13C atoms were incorporated into the peptide (Figure S4E). The MS data suggested that almost all of the JBIR-34 had been labeled with two 13C atoms. Furthermore, the m/z values of the A, B, and C fragments increased by 2, which was consistent with the incorporation of two 13C atoms. In contrast to our expec-tation, this result indicated that the two methyl groups of the indole chromophore came from methionine, and that the methyl group of the 4-methyloxazoline ring was not derived from methi-onine (Figure S4E).",
        "Next, we hypothesized that the methyloxazoline moiety may be formed by heterocyclization of a-methyl-L-serine, which could be synthesized from D-alanine by FmoH, a homolog of AmiS in the amicetin biosynthesis (Zhang et al., 2012). To test our second hypothesis, we fed [3-13C]-L-alanine, which seems to be easily converted to [3-13C]-D-alanine in vivo, to Strepto-myces sp. Sp080513GE-23. The produced JBIR-34 was analyzed by HR-MS/MS to examine the incorporation of 13C. The parent ion of JBIR-34 showed several peaks in addition to the native peaks; there were two strong peaks corresponding to two ions that were 1 and 2 Da larger than the monoisotopic parent ion (Figure S4F). This result suggested that two alanine molecules could be incorporated into JBIR-34. Analysis by mass spectroscopy revealed that approximately 46% and 39% of the JBIR-34 had been labeled with one and two 13C atoms, respectively. Fragment A also showed a similar isotopic compo-sition to the parent ion (Figure S4F). In contrast, fragment B showed a different isotopic composition from the parent ion and fragment A; approximately 58% and 6% of JBIR-34 were 3\u2013934, August 14, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 927",

        "In this study, we identified the biosynthetic origin of the unusual 4-methyloxazoline moiety of JBIR-34 and -35 as a-methyl-L-serine. We showed that the A domain of FmoA3 recognizes a-methyl-L-serine. Because the ability of NRPSs to utilize nonproteinogenic amino acids is important for the structural diversity of NRPs, this study will open the way for synthesizing novel NRPs by genetic engineering of NRPSs. We also revealed that FmoH, a glycine/serine hydroxyme-thyltransferase homolog, catalyzed the conversion between D-alanine and a-methyl-L-serine, indicating that FmoH func-tions as an a-methyl-L-serine synthase. Our in vitro analysis of FmoH is a characterization of a-methyl-L-serine synthase that correlates with NRP biosynthesis. Identification of the a-methyl-L-serine-recognizing A domain and a-methyl-L-serine synthase will facilitate genomemining of novel NRPs.",

The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra of compound 3 were re-corded in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 on a JNM-A500 NMR System (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra of compound 4 were recorded in DMSO-d6 on a Varian 600 NB CL NMR System (Varian). Construction of the Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 DfmoA3 Mutant A PCR targeting system using the cosmid pTJ34-3 carrying the gene cluster was used to construct the deletion mutant. The pKGLP2 vector carrying a beta-glucuronidase as a selection marker (Myronovskyi et al., 2011) was used. The details are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Production, Extraction, and LC-ESI MS Analysis of JBIR-34 and -35 Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 or the DfmoA3mutant was inoculated into 10ml ISP-2medium and incubated at 30NoneC for 2 days. Two and a half milliliters of the culture were transferred to fresh 100 ml ISP-2 medium and further incu-932 Chemistry & Biology 21, 923\u2013934, August 14, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevi",
        "bated at 30NoneC for 5 days. The supernatant was extracted with ethyl acetate three times and further extracted with butanol twice. The butanol layer was evaporated to dryness and the residual material was dissolved in 200 ml of DMSO for liquid chromatography-electron spray ionization mass spectrom-etry (LC-ESI MS) analysis. LC-ESI MS was carried out using Agilent 1100 series (Agilent Technologies) and the high-capacity trap plus system (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a MonoBis column (2 3 50 mm; Kyoto Monotech). The compounds were eluted with a linear gradient using water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as themobile phase. The amounts of JBIR-34 and -35 and compound 3 were estimated by integrating the corresponding peak areas in the chromatogram (absorbance unit at 300 nm) and comparing these values to those of the purified samples. Feeding Experiments Using [Methyl-13C]-L-Methionine and [3-13C]-L-Alanine [Methyl-13C]-L-methionine and [3-13C]-L-alanine were purchased from ISOTEC and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, respectively. Streptomyces sp. Sp080513GE-23 was inoculated into 10 ml ISP-2 medium and incubated at 30NoneC for 2 days. Fifty microliters of the culture were transferred to fresh 5 ml ISP-2 medium containing 2 g/l of [methyl-13C]-L-methionine or [3-13C]-L-alanine and further incubated at 30NoneC for 5 days. The supernatant was ex-tracted with ethyl acetate three times and further extracted with butanol twice. The butanol layer was evaporated to dryness and the residual material was dissolved in 200 ml of DMSO for LC-ESI MS analysis. LC-ESI MS was carried out as described previously. HR-MS/MS analysis was carried out usingWaters SYNAPT G2 (Waters). Expression and Purification of FmoH pET28a-fmoH was constructed by cloning the fmoH gene amplified by PCR into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET28a. From the E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET28a-fmoH, FmoH fused N-terminally with a histidine tag was purified as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. In Vitro Assay of FmoH The standard reaction mixture (100 ml) contained 2 mM of FmoH, 1 mM sub-strate, 0.5 mM THF, 10 mM PLP, and 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). After incubation at 30NoneC for 1 hr, the reaction was quenched by adding 100 ml of methanol (for FDLA derivatization) or acetonitrile (for 9-fluorenylme-thyloxycarbonyl derivatization). After derivatization was performed as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, the products were analyzed with LC-ESI MS equippedwith aMonoBis column (23 50mm; Kyoto Monotech). Compounds were eluted with a linear gradient using water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. For the analysis of the kinetic parameters, the reactionmixture (50 ml) containing 4 mMof FmoH, different concentrations of a-methyl-L-serine (varied in the range of 50\u20132,000 mM), 0.5 mM THF, 20 mM PLP, and 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) was incubated at 30NoneC for 5 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 ml of acetonitrile. The 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl derivatives were then analyzed with LC-ESI MS, and the yields were estimated by comparing the peak areas with those of the authentic standards. The kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the substrate concentration-initial veloc-ity plot to the equitation Vmax*[S]/(Km+[S]). Expression and Purification of FmoA Proteins The DNA fragments encoding whole fmoA1, fmoA2, fmoA3, fmoA4, and fmoA5 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pColdI (Takara), resulting in pColdI-fmoA1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. From the E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring one of these plasmids, each FmoA fused N-terminally with a histidine tag was purified as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. In Vitro Analysis of Adenylating Activity Each FmoA protein (1 mM) was incubated with 5 mM possible substrates in 80 ml of buffer containing 150 mM hydroxylamine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 U/ ml pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 0.5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Hydroxylamine solution was prepared according to the method reported by Kadi and Challis (2009). The reaction mixture was prein-cubated for 2 min, and the reaction was initiated by adding ATP. After 30-min incubation, the reaction was quenched by adding 20 ml of working er Ltd All rights reserved",
