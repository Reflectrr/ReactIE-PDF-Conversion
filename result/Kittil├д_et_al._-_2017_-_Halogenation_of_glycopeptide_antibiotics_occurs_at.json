Cryle *acdi and Evi Stegmann*bh Halogenation plays a significant role in the activity of the glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs), although up until now the timing and therefore exact substrate involvedwas unclear. Here, we present results combined from in vivo and in vitro studies that reveal the substrates for the halogenase enzymes from GPA biosynthesis as amino acid residues bound to peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-domains from the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase machinery: no activity was detected upon either free amino acids or PCP-bound peptides. Furthermore, we show that the selectivity of GPA halogenase enzymes depends upon both the structure of the bound amino acid and the PCP domain, rather than being driven solely via the PCP domain. These studies provide the first detailed understanding of how halogenation is performed during GPA biosynthesis and highlight the importance and versatility of trans-acting enzymes that operate during peptide assembly by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Introduction Non-ribosomal peptide synthesis is a highly important route for the production of bioactive peptides, many of which have medicinal value. Some of the most important members of non-ribosomal peptides are known for their antibiotic action: well-ax Planck Institute for Medical Research, and Infection Medicine Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 28, mann@biotech.uni-tuebingen.de n, Victoria 3800, Australia.

Adenylation (A)-domains catalyse the selection and activation of precursors, which are then loaded onto peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-domains via a phos-phopantetheine linker.4 The resultant thioester linkage remains chemically reactive for peptide bond formation \u2013 catalysed by condensation (C)-domains \u2013 but retains NRPS biosynthetic intermediates in a protein-bound form.5 In addition to these domains crucial for peptide synthesis, many NRPSs have addi-tional modi\ue103cation domains, such as epimerisation (E)-domains, which alter the stereochemistry of amino acid resi-dues and are a common hallmark of NRPS-produced peptides.6 The \ue103nal peptide product is detached from the NRPSmachinery via hydrolysis or cyclisation catalysed by a thioesterase (TE)-domain, which also offers further options to gain biological activity and compound diversity.7\u20139 The complexity of the products of NRPS biosynthesis not only stems from the direct actions of the NRPS assembly line but also from a great number of further peptide modi\ue103cations by external enzymes acting in trans.

View Article Onlinechains, cytochrome P450-catalysed crosslinking of aromatic side chains, glycosylation, sulfation, acylation as well as the incorporation of chlorine atoms into the peptide via the halo-genation of aromatic side chains of amino acid residues.10 Many of the modi\ue103cations appear to be directed towards improving the selectivity of GPAs towards speci\ue103c bacterial strains but some, for example the installation of crosslinks into the peptide backbone, are essential for their antibiotic activity.10,11 Because of their crucial roles in GPA biosynthesis, the modi\ue103cation enzymes are an appealing target for GPA remodelling.12 GPAs can be divided into several classes based on the hep-tapeptide backbone structure.10,13 Type I GPAs possess aliphatic residues at positions one and three of the peptide and display three crosslinks between aromatic residues of the peptide, forming the AB, C-O-D and D-O-E rings needed for GPA activity. Type II GPAs share the crosslinking pattern of Type I GPAs but contain aromatic residues at positions one and three of the peptide. Type III and IV GPAs also have aromatic residues at positions one and three of the peptide, but these are crosslinked to form an additional F-O-G ring, with differentiation between these classes due to the presence of an acyl moiety in Type IV GPAs that is absent in Type III GPAs. Balhimycin belongs to the vancomycin-type peptides (Type I GPAs), with balhimycin differing from vancomycin only with regard to the glycosylation pattern, whilst teicoplanin belongs to the Type IV GPAs (Fig. 1). The chlorine atoms present within the GPA peptides contribute signi\ue103cantly to the binding affinity of the GPAs for their target, the dipeptide terminus of lipid II.14\u201316 In both Type I and IV GPAs b-hydroxy-tyrosine (OH\u2013Tyr) and/or tyrosine (Tyr) residues are chlorinated in the positions two and six by halo-genases that belong to the class of \ue104avin (FADH2)-dependent Fig. 1 Biosynthesis of glycopeptide antibiotics.

The peptides produced are m peptide is still bound to the machinery and by glycosylation after release decorated by acylation and balhimycin by methylation. The numbering o This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017 halogenases. Most GPA gene clusters encode a single halogen-ase, which was shown in balhimycin biosynthesis to be responsible for chlorination of both positions in the peptide.17 Some GPA gene clusters possess an additional halogenase enzyme that appears to play a role in the chlorination of 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (4-Hpg) residues.18 Whilst insights into the mechanism of FADH2-dependent halogenases have been gained from structural and functional studies,19,20 reconstitu-tion of halogenase activity in vitro has proven to be difficult. Most of the FADH2-dependent halogenases characterised so far are tryptophan halogenases that act on substrates free in solu-tion.21\u201323 However, halogenases acting on PCP-bound substrates have also been characterised.24,25 In both cases chlorination of the substrate takes place before monomer incorporation to the natural product. The timing of the chlorination during GPA biosynthesis is still under debate. Four possible scenarios for the incorporation of halide atoms have been postulated and \u2013 to some extent \u2013 investigated (Fig. 2). In the \ue103rst scenario, amino acids are chlorinated prior to incorporation by the NRPS machinery; in the second, halogenation of amino acids takes place a\ue09der loading onto a PCP-domain; in the third, the peptide is chlori-nated during peptide synthesis; and in the fourth, halogenation takes place a\ue09der the peptide aglycone has been formed by P450 (Oxy) enzymes. Previously, the inactivation of the P450 mono-oxygenases responsible for GPA side chain cyclisation in vivo26\u201329 strongly suggested that halogenation would take place prior to cyclisation. Furthermore, these scenarios have been studied using two homologous halogenases from Type I GPA biosyn-thesis: BhaA from balhimycin biosynthesis and VhaA from vancomycin biosynthesis. In vivo gene disruption studies of cin (Type I GPA) and teicoplanin (Type IV GPA) is highly similar: their etase machineries (major structural differences in the structures of the odified by crosslinking and chlorination (indicated in green) while the of the peptide from the NRPS machinery.

Four different scenarios for GPA chlorination have been suggested and to some extend studied. Halogenation of free amino acid has been ruled out but indications for the other three scenarios have been obtained. Chemical Science Edge Article O pe n A cc es s A rt ic le .

View Article OnlineBhaA have shown that supplementation of the medium by chlorinated amino acids is not able to restore production of the natural, halogenated GPA if the halogenase gene is deleted.30 In contrast, supplementation of the growth medium with non-chlorinated OH\u2013Tyr could overcome the deletion of the genes essential for OH\u2013Tyr production and restore the formation of the halogenated type I GPAs.30 These results strongly suggest that scenario one, chlorination prior to incorporation by module 2 and 6 of the NRPS machinery, is not possible. Although halogenation of free amino acids has been for most part ruled out, debate concerning the other three scenarios continues. The generation of various halogenated peptide GPA intermediates in a strain where the \ue103nal conden-sation domain had been deleted points towards incorporation of the halide atoms during peptide biosynthesis.11 Precedent would suggest a mechanism of action similar to that identi\ue103ed for the halogenase enzymes from pyoluteorin synthesis24 or enediyne synthesis,25 where aminoacyl-PCP domains are the substrates for modi\ue103cation during peptide biosynthesis by the NRPS machinery; other enzymes have also been identi\ue103ed that adopt this approach.31,32 In contrast to this, in vitro studies using a P450 enzyme that crosslinks aromatic side chains from the vancomycin biosynthetic cluster (OxyBvan) showed that halide atoms in PCP-bound hexapeptide substrates made the peptides worse substrates for the \ue103rst crosslinking step,33 suggesting that chlorination would take place on the aglycone. However, these studies did not take into account the role of the X-domain in recruiting the P450 enzymes to the NRPS-bound peptide34\u201338 and recent results39 indicate that halogenated peptides are cross-linked equally well when presented by NRPS modules contain-ing the X-domain, making halogenation prior to P450 activity a distinct possibility. So far, all characterised FADH2-dependent halogenases associated with natural products produced by NRPS machin-eries act on amino acid/pyrrole substrates rather than on the \ue103nal product, strongly suggesting the PCP-bound amino acid to be the substrate for halogenases in GPA biosynthesis. However, 5994 | Chem. Sci., 2017, 8, 5992\u20136004 in vitro experiments using VhaA showed low levels of activity upon PCP-bound hexapeptide substrates40 pointing towards chlorination of the peptide rather than amino acid substrate. Thus, the exact timing of halogenation in GPA biosynthesis has remained unclear until this current study. Here, we are now able to show that halogenation occurs during peptide biosynthesis and that the substrates for the GPA halogenase enzymes are the PCP-bound amino acids, two OH\u2013Tyr residues at amino acid (AA) position 2 and 6 for Type I GPA and two Tyr residues at position 2 and 6 for Type IV GPAs. Results Analysis of GPA halogenation in vitro In order to assess the halogenation state of peptide precursors during GPA biosynthesis, we performed in vitro turnover experiments. In this regard, we explored the halogenase enzymes from both the balhimycin producer (Amycolatopsis balhimycina) as well as the teicoplanin producer (A. teichomy-ceticus). Both enzymes could be overproduced and puri\ue103ed in an FAD-bound form as anticipated (Fig. S1\u2020). The former enzyme was overproduced in Pseudomonas \ue104uorescens BL915 DORF1-4 containing the gene bhaA40 in the E. coli-Pseudomonas shuttle vector pCIBhis and the latter in E. coli. We prepared a range of substrates for activity assays: tyro-sine, Type IV dipeptide (4-Hpg-Tyr), hexapeptide41 (leucine (Leu)-Tyr-asparagine (Asn)-4-Hpg-4-Hpg-Tyr) and two different heptapeptides42 (Leu-Tyr-Asn-4-Hpg-4-Hpg-Tyr-Dpg and 4-Hpg-Tyr-Dpg-4-Hpg-4-Hpg-Tyr-Dpg) (Fig. 4\u20136). Substrates were loaded on various PCP domains using the promiscuous phos-phopantetheinyl transferase Sfp. Tyrosine was loaded on both PCP-domains that would be expected to interact with the hal-ogenase enzyme (PCP2 and PCP6 from a Type IV NRPS) as well as to a PCP-domain that \u2013 based on the GPA chlorination pattern \u2013 is not anticipated to interact with the halogenase enzyme (PCP1 from a Type IV NRPS) to test if the PCP-domain is responsible for guiding the halogenase to the correct substrate.

View Article OnlineDipeptide was loaded onto a PCP2 domain (Type IV) and hex-apeptide on a PCP7 domain (Type I), whilst heptapeptides were loaded on PCP7 domain either from Type I or Type IV NRPSs. Chlorination of tyrosine and dipeptide were also studied using substrates free in solution. We assessed activity using UPLC-MS with single ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple reaction moni-toring (MRM), a\ue09der cleavage of PCP-bound substrates using excess methylamine to afford the methylamide products. The halogenase from the teicoplanin system (Tcp21) dis-played activity upon PCP-bound tyrosine as a substrate. We could observe activity upon tyrosine bound to PCP-domains 1, 2 and 6 from the teicoplanin NRPSmachinery, which implies that the halogenase is not solely selective for the PCP domain and that the bound amino acid plays a role in regulating halogenase activity (Fig. 3A). Tyrosine in solution was not chlorinated by Tcp21, which suggests that the interaction with a PCP domain is crucial for catalysis. The loading efficiency differed between the three PCP-domains but the amount of chlorinated tyrosine stayed at the same level in each reaction, which shows that the turnover efficiency appears to be limited by the in vitro efficiency of Tcp21 (Fig. 3B). We also tested whether the halogenase was able to act upon dipeptide substrates. Under the conditions where we observed halogenase activity upon PCP-bound tyro-sine, we could show that neither PCP-loaded nor free dipeptide was a substrate for the enzyme (Fig. 4). We also tested longer peptides as potential substrates for halogenation, however \u2013 and as with the dipeptide substrates \u2013 we did not observe any activity upon these substrates (Fig. 5 and 6). Thus, the results of our in vitro characterisation indicate that PCP-bound amino acids are the actual substrates for halogenation during Type IV GPA biosynthesis. We did not detect activity of the balhimycin halogenase (BhaA) upon any substrates (data not shown), which we attribute to the lack of the hydroxylated side chain of the tyrosine residue (present in Type I GPAs) in the aminoacyl-PCP substrate.10 Fig. 3 Chlorination of tyrosine substrates by Tcp21.

Construction of a dipeptide producing GPA strain Since BhaA showed no in vitro activity, we decided to assess the halogenation state in A. balhimycina in vivo. Given that we have elucidated balhimycin biosynthesis in detail,12 have developed tools to construct A. balhimycina mutants and elucidated the resultant intermediates, we generated a balhimycin producer strain that possessed a modi\ue103ed NRPS machinery to investigate halogenation.43\u201345 As our hypothesis is that the PCP-bound amino acids are substrates for the halogenase during GPA biosynthesis, wemodi\ue103ed the balhimycin NRPS in such a way as to address the \ue103rst peptide intermediate that should contain a halogenated residue \u2013 a dipeptide. Three NRPS proteins, BpsA, BpsB and BpsC, are involved in the assembly of the GPA heptapeptide core (Fig. 7). Module 2 is part of BpsA and consists of C-A-PCP (PCP1) and E domains, while module 3 consists of a C-, A-and PCP-domain (PCP3). The C-domain of module 3 is responsible for tripeptide formation from the Leu\u2013OH\u2013Tyr dipeptide and Asn. To terminate the non-ribosomal peptide synthesis a\ue09der module 2 and hence produce a dipeptide for analysis, signi\ue103cant parts of the C-domain of module 3 were This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017 deleted and replaced by TE-domain of BpsC to provoke release of the dipeptide intermediate (Fig. 7).

A peak with the samem/z ratio as methylamide-Cl-dipeptide is seen in both turnover and control reactions: however, the retention time of this peak does not correspond with authentic chlorinated dipeptide standards indicating that this peak does not correspond to chlorinate dipeptide and is unrelated to enzymatic activity; no peaks for chlorinated products were detected.

View Article Onlineterminal part of the C-domain of module 3, and mod2right (1334 bp) including the C-terminal part of the C-domain and the A-domain of module 3, were ampli\ue103ed by PCR and used for the deletion of the C-domain (see Experimental procedures, Fig. 7). The TE-domain of BpsC was ampli\ue103ed by PCR and inserted between the fragments mod2le\ue09d andmod2right resulting in the plasmid pCKmod2. The non-replicative plasmid pCK/mod2 was used to transform the A. balhimycina wildtype strain by the direct transformation method. The plasmid selection marker conferring erythromycin resistance was used to identify clones in which a \ue103rst homologous recombination event occurred. Ten erythromycin resistant clones were obtained. These clones were analysed in a bioassay with Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, to check whether the integration of pCK/mod2 resulted in the loss of balhimycin production. Loss of balhimycin production would be the expected result of recombination via the chromosomal bpsA gene. Two of the ten clones lost the ability to produce an active antibiotic and the correct integration of pCKmod2 was veri\ue103ed by Southern Blot hybridisation; both clones turned out to be identical. The non-producing clone (CK1) showed the 5996 | Chem. Sci., 2017, 8, 5992\u20136004 intended integration of the plasmid within the region coding for the C-domain. For the other eight erythromycin resistant clones that still produced balhimycin the crossover took place via the part of the bpsC gene which encodes the TE-domain at the end of BpsC. To obtain the replacement mutant, a second homologous recombination in CK1 was required: since double crossover events happen at a low frequency in A. balhimycina, a \u201cstress\u201d treatment (see Experimental procedures) \u2013 whose application increases the probability of a second crossover event \u2013 was carried out with clone CK1. Following this protocol, 650 colo-nies were examined on R5 agar plates both in the presence and absence of erythromycin. Two of the \u201cstressed\u201d colonies lost the integrated plasmid as indicated by the lack of erythromycin resistance. These two clones, CK2.1 and CK2.2, were not able to produce an active antibiotic, indicating that the second cross-over led to the disruption of the non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis. The gene replacement and loss of pCK/mod2 was con\ue103rmed by Southern Blot analyses; a DIG-labelled PCR frag-ment of the TE-domain was used as a probe with total DNA of the two mutants CK2.1 and CK2.2 and the wildtype of A. bal-himycina. The Southern Blot clearly showed two bands of the expected size in the case of the mutants while in the total DNA of A. balhimycina wildtype only a single band was visible (Fig. S2\u2020). This result combined with the loss of balhimycin production showed that CK2.1 and CK2.2 are identical and con\ue103rmed the correct identity of the replacement mutants. The mutant CK2.1 was fermented under production condi-tions and the culture broth was analysed by HPLC-ESI-MS.

Remarkably, the molecular mass of this dipeptide was found at two different retention times in the HPLC run, which suggests the presence of two diastereoisomers due to alternate stereochemistry of the second amino acid, b-hydroxytyrosine (Fig. S3\u2020). Given that the epimerisation domain that converts (L)\u2013OH\u2013Tyr to (D)\u2013OH\u2013Tyr in the NRPS is still This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017 present, this implies that the inserted thioesterase domain is able to compete effectively with the E-domain for the peptidyl-PCP substrate to generate two diastereomers of the product dipeptide. In order to con\ue103rm the constitutional structures of these dipeptides, daughter ion spectra were generated and signals assigned. It was found that the main fragment signals of both diastereoisomers were identical indicating the same constitutional formulae (Fig. S4\u2020). We further synthesised synthetic standards of the suspected Leu\u2013OH\u2013Cl-Tyr diaste-reomers and could thus con\ue103rm the identity of the products identi\ue103ed from the A. balhimycina mutant, with the major dipeptide peak corresponding to the dipeptide bearing the (L)\u2013 OH\u2013Tyr residue (Fig. S5 and S6\u2020). This result con\ue103rms that halogenation during GPA biosynthesis already takes place on module 2 during NRPS synthesis. Discussion The diversi\ue103cation of peptide scaffolds within NRPS biosyn-thesis provides a tremendous source of selectivity and function. Halogenation is an important example of one such modi\ue103ca-tion, and the GPAs are an excellent example of the effects halogenation can have on compound activity, as the removal of chlorine atoms from GPAs leads to signi\ue103cant reduction in binding affinity for the dipeptide terminus of lipid II.14\u201316 Hal-ogenase activity from different biosynthetic systems has been demonstrated for different types of substrates \u2013 either free in solution or carrier protein bound \u2013 with selectivity varying from one system to another.46 However, the timing and substrate selectivity of halogenation during GPA biosynthesis has previ-ously been unclear. Whilst the activity of the vancomycin hal-ogenase upon PCP-bound peptides has been reported, the use of mismatched peptide and PCP-domain within the substrates tested and the lack of cohesion with previous preliminary in vivo data led us to investigate this process further.40 In this work, we have been able to combine comprehensive results of both in vivo and in vitro experiments to show that GPA halogenase enzymes act during NRPS-mediated peptide assembly. Initially, through the in vitro characterisation of the halogenase Tcp21 from tei-coplanin biosynthesis we could clearly demonstrate that halo-genase activity was present with tyrosine only when the amino acid was presented in a PCP-bound form. Furthermore, we could show that the identity of the PCP-domain able to support tyrosine halogenation was not strictly correlated with the observed halogenation pattern of teicoplanin, which suggests that a combination of correct amino acid and PCP-domain is required for GPA halogenation during NRPS-catalysed peptide synthesis in vivo. Our results are in contrast to the results described by Schmartz et al.,40 in which the authors demon-strated the chlorination of both OH\u2013Tyr residues on a linear hexapeptide intermediate attached to the PCP domain in module-6 of the NRPS during vancomycin assembly. Chlorina-tion at this stage of GPA biosynthesis shows that this halogen-ase demonstrates the in vitro capability to modify two quite different sites within the hexapeptide-PCP substrate: this activity is challenging to reconcile with other examples of GPA halogenation (e.g. A40926,47 which displays chlorination at Chem.

View Article Onlineresidues 3 and 6 of the peptide, or the signi\ue103cantly altered pattern found in the Type-V GPA complestatin).48 We therefore decided to explore our hypothesis that chlorination occurs on the PCP-bound amino acid using further in vitro and in vivo studies on a different GPA halogenase: the balhimycin halo-genase BhaA. Previous in vivo gene disruption experiments of the balhimycin synthetase had revealed the presence of chlori-nated GPA peptide precursors during NRPS-catalysed peptide synthesis.11 In order to further test whether the substrates of GPA halogenation are aminoacyl-PCPs, we constructed a mutant balhimycin producer strain that had been engineered to produce the minimal GPA peptide that could contain a chlo-rine atom \u2013 a dipeptide. Following the successful construction of the strain, analysis of the peptide products and comparison to authentic standards clearly revealed the presence and con\ue103rmed the identity of the chlorinated dipeptides produced. This result indicates that halogenation during GPA biosynthesis occurs during NRPS-mediated peptide biosynthesis: as neither Tcp21 nor BhaA were active upon peptide substrates, the halo-genase activity observed during NRPS-catalysed peptide synthesis in vivo can be deduced as occurring upon PCP-bound amino acids, which matches the results of our in vitro experi-ments. The lack of activity of BhaA upon PCP-bound tyrosine is also consistent with the differences in the generation of OH\u2013Tyr residues during balhimycin and teicoplanin biosynthesis. In 5998 | Chem. Sci., 2017, 8, 5992\u20136004 balhimycin biosynthesis, the correct PCP-bound amino acid substrates for BhaA would be OH\u2013Tyr and not Tyr, as OH\u2013Tyr is incorporated directly into the precursor peptide by the balhi-mycin NRPS machinery.30,45 This is signi\ue103cantly different to teicoplanin biosynthesis, in which tyrosine is initially recog-nised and incorporated into the GPA peptide by the NRPS and that is followed by subsequent generation of OH\u2013Tyr via the actions of a non-heme iron oxygenase.49 The results from BhaA in vitro experiments further demonstrate the substrate speci-\ue103city of the GPA halogenase enzymes and underlines the importance of having the correct amino acid loaded onto the PCP to enable halogenation during GPA biosynthesis. Conclusion In this work, we have obtained conclusive evidence that halo-genation occurs during NRPS-mediated peptide assembly in GPA biosynthesis. By combining the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments we have been able to show that aminoacyl-PCP substrates are recognised by halogenase enzymes and that the pairing of both the PCP-domain and bound substrate is crucial to activity: this model (see also ref. 50) helps to explain why some GPAs (such as A40926) display halogenation at different residues47 or differing levels,51 whilst others (such as pekisko-mycin)52 are lacking chlorination at residues that would This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017 Edge Article Chemical Science O pe n A cc es s A rt ic le .

View Article Onlineanticipate to be halogenated based on similar GPAs.3 Our GPA halogenation model also aligns with results obtained from biosynthetic studies of other halogenated peptides produced by NRPS-systems (such as enduracidin/ramoplanin), where switching the halogenase enzyme in vivo leads to a product where the halogenation pattern is altered in spite of highly similar peptide structures.53,54 Our results suggest that the alteration of halogenase enzymes within GPA producer strains could well produce alternatively halogenated GPA products: given that halogen atoms can act as handles for chemical modi\ue103cation of GPAs55,56 and the synthetic challenge of producing such compounds,14,15 switching halogenase enzymes (such as has been done for other modi\ue103cation enzymes in GPA biosynthesis)57 would appear to be an important route that should be explored to enable the future diversi\ue103cation of GPA scaffolds. Experimental In vivo experiments Strains and plasmids. E. coli XL1-blue58 was used as general cloning host. A. balhimycina DSM5908 (ref. 59) is the balhimycin producing wildtype and was used to generate the NRPS mutant CK1 and CK2 (this study). The replacement plasmid pCKmod2 (this study) is a derivative of the non-replicative vector pSP1.43 Media and culture conditions. Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria broth (LB) medium60 at 37 NoneC, supplemented with 100 mg mlNone1 ampicillin when necessary to maintain plas-mids. A. balhimycina strains were grown in R5 medium61 at 30 NoneC. Liquid/solid media were supplemented with 50 mg mlNone1 erythromycin to select for strains carrying integrated antibiotic resistance genes. P. \ue104uorescens was grown in LB medium at 30 NoneC in the presence of 50 mg mlNone1 kanamycin and 30 mg mlNone1 tetracycline for 72 h. Preparation and manipulation of DNA. Methods for isola-tion and manipulation of DNA were performed as reported.60,61 PCR fragments were isolated from agarose gels with QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Restriction endonucleases (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA and Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) were used according to their speci\ue103cations. PCR protocols for ampli\ue103cation of the fragments mod2le\ue09d, mod2right and TE PCRs were performed on a Robo Cycler Gradient 40 thermocycler from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA) with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany). For the ampli\ue103cation of the fragments mod2le\ue09d, mod2right and TE the following PCR conditions were used: initial denaturation (95 NoneC for 5 min), 30 cycles of dena-turation (95 NoneC for 2 min), annealing (69 NoneC for 1 min), and polymerisation (72 NoneC for 1 min 30 s), an additional polymeri-sation step (72 NoneC for 10 min) at the end. The primers used were as follows: ampli\ue103cation of mod2le\ue09d (1289 bp): Mod2le\ue09dP1, Mod2le\ue09dP2; for ampli\ue103cation of fragment mod2right (1334 bp): Mod2rightP1, Mod2rightP2, and for TE (831 bp): TE2le\ue09d, TE2right. Construction of the replacement plasmid pCKmod2. Plasmid pCKmod2 was constructed for the interruption of the nonribosomal peptide synthesis a\ue09der module 2 of BpsA. In This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017 addition to the deletion of the C-domain of module 3, the integration of a TE domain, (containing a stop codon to terminate translation of the downstream genes) should mediate the release of the synthesized intermediate. To this end, the fragments mod2le\ue09d, mod2right and TE were ampli\ue103ed by PCR. Firstly, the TE fragment was cloned using blunt ends into the pDrive vector (Qiagen) (TE/pDrive). The second fragment mod2le\ue09d was cloned into TE/pDrive using the restriction sites NdeI and XbaI (pDriveM2L/TE). Finally, the third fragment mod2right was cloned into pDriveM2L/TE following digestion with HpaI/SphI. The complete interruption cassette was cloned into the non-replicative vector pSP1 using XbaI and SphI to obtain pCKmod2 (scheme in Fig. 2). Direct transformation of A. balhimycina. For transformation of A. balhimycina, a modi\ue103ed transformation method was used as described previously.43 \u201cStress\u201d protocol. The stress treatment was essentially used as described previously.17 For further fragmentation, protoplast were generated as described by Thompson et al.62 A\ue09der storage on ice (10 min), 100 ml of appropriate dilutions (10None1 to 10None4) were plated on R5 agar plates. A\ue09der incubation at 30 NoneC for 10\u2013 14 days, the colonies were used for further investigation. Determination of balhimycin biosynthesis. Balhimycin production was determined by bioassays using Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 as a test organism and cell-free supernatants of A. balhimycina strains grown in R5 medium. Southern blot analyses. Digests of genomic A. balhimycina DNA were separated in 1% agarose gels in Tris-acetate buffer and transferred to Hybond-N Nylon membranes (GE Health-care, Mu\u0308nchen, Germany). For labelling of DNA probes and hybridisation the nonradioactive DIG DNA Labelling and Detection Kit from Roche was used at high stringency (0.1% SDS/0.1 None SSC, 68 NoneC). As a size standard, the DIG-labelled DNA Molecular Weight Marker VII (Roche) with the following frag-ment lengths (in base pairs) was used: 81, 359, 492, 710, 992, 1164, 1482, 1515, 1882, 1953, 2799, 3639, 4899, 6106, 7427 and 8576. The procedure followed a standard protocol.60 HPLC-ESI-MS and \u2013MS-MS (culture broth). The culture broth of the mutant CK1 was investigated by HPLC-ESI-MS(/MS). For sample preparation an adsorption chromatography with AMBERLITE\u00ae XAD16 material was performed. The used HPLC-ESI-MS-MS system consisted of a capillary-LC-system (1100 series, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, Bo\u0308blingen, Germany) coupled to a QTrap2000 with a TurboIonSpray source (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).

HPLC analysis was performed using an XBridge BEH300 C18 column (5 mm, 4.6 None 250 mm) at 1 ml minNone1 (gradient: 5% MeCN for 4 minutes, 5\u201365% MeCN in 30 minutes, (D,D)-dipeptide tR \u00bc 9.85 minutes, (D,L)-dipeptide tR \u00bc 10.20 minutes). Synthesis of chlorinated dipeptide Leu\u2013OH\u2013Cl-Tyr stan-dards. Boc-(D)-leucine (24.5 mg, 0.105 mmol) and HOBt (14 mg, 0.105 mmol) were dissolved in 500 ml of DMF at room temperature. A\ue09der cooling to 0 NoneC, the addition of DIC (16.2 ml, 0.105 mmol) enabled the pre-activation of Boc-(D)-leucine as the-OBt ester a\ue09der 30 min, the solution was added drop-wise to a solution containing either (2R,3R)-b-hydroxy-3-chlorotyrosine or (2S,3R)-b-hydroxy-3-chlorotyrosine (25 mg, 0.105 mmol) dissolved in 500 ml of DMF. The pH was adjusted by the addition of TEA (36 ml, 0.26 mmol) to allow the dipeptide formation to proceed at room temperature. A\ue09der 15 h, the reaction was quenched by the addition of an aqueous solution of saturated NaHCO3 and then acidi\ue103ed to pH 3 with an aqueous solution of 0.1 N HCl. The dipeptide was extracted with ethyl acetate (3None), the organic phase washed with brine (3None), dried over Na2SO4, \ue103ltered and concentrated under vacuum. The Boc protecting group was cleaved in 2 ml of a TFA/TIS/H2O solution (95%/2.5%/2.5%) without further puri\ue103cation for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the solution was concentrated under a stream of nitrogen to None0.5 ml and the peptide precipitated via addition of 5 ml cold diethyl ether. A\ue09der centrifugation washing with diethyl ether (3None), the peptide was dissolved in 95% water/5% MeCN, analyzed by LC-MS (gradient of 5% to 35% in MeCN in 30 minutes) and puri\ue103ed by RP-HPLC (gradient of 0% to 30% in MeCN in 30 minutes).

Substrate loading on PCP domains. Coenzyme A coupled tyrosine was loaded on PCP domains using 1 : 3 : 0.004 ratio of PCP domain, CoA-Tyr and Sfp R4-4 (ref. 65) respectively (10 min, RT, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mMMgCl2, 1 mMDTE). For hexa-and heptapeptide-CoAs41,42 ratio of 1 : 3 : 10 was used (1 hour, 30 NoneC). Dipeptide substrates were loaded to Trx-PCP2-domain in a modi\ue103ed one pot loading reaction.65,66 100 mM Trx-PCP2, 2.5 mM PanK and 300 mM pantetheine-dipeptide were mixed in loading buffer (100 mMTris$HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mMMgCl2, 1 mM DTE). Reaction was started by addition on 1 mM ATP (5 minutes, RT). 10 mM PPAT were added and reaction incu-bated for another 10 minutes followed by addition of 0.1 UmlNone1 of alkaline phosphatase (10 minutes, M0290, Roche). Finally, the substrate was loaded to Trx-PCP2 domain using 3 mM Sfp R4-4 (15 minutes). Excess of substrate was removed a\ue09der all loading reactions in centrifugal concentrators using serial concentrating-diluting 6002 | Chem. Sci., 2017, 8, 5992\u20136004 steps (10 000 MWCO, 0.5 ml, Merck Millipore). Loaded PCP domains were used as quickly as possible for assays to prevent substrate hydrolysis. Halogenase activity assay. 9 mMHalogenase and 5.8 mMYcnD were mixed in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTE) containing FAD and FMN in excess. FAD is required by the halogenase enzyme and FMN by the reduction partner. 50 mM of substrate (either in solution or loaded to a PCP domain) was added and reactions startedwith 2mMNADH (30 NoneC, 1 hour). 2 mM NADH was added again 15 minutes a\ue09der beginning of the reaction. Substrates were cleaved from PCP-domains by addition of methylamine (3 ml, 10 minutes) and proteins precipitated with formic acid (1.5 ml). Supernatants were \ue103ltered and analysed on a Acquity UPLC Peptide BEH C18 column (1.7 mM, 2.1None 100 mm, Waters) using Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometer (LCMS-8050, Shimadzu) with single ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) (Table 2).

        "Halogenation plays a significant role in the activity of the glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs), although up until now the timing and therefore exact substrate involvedwas unclear. Here, we present results combined from in vivo and in vitro studies that reveal the substrates for the halogenase enzymes from GPA biosynthesis as amino acid residues bound to peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-domains from the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase machinery: no activity was detected upon either free amino acids or PCP-bound peptides. Furthermore, we show that the selectivity of GPA halogenase enzymes depends upon both the structure of the bound amino acid and the PCP domain, rather than being driven solely via the PCP domain. These studies provide the first detailed understanding of how halogenation is performed during GPA biosynthesis and highlight the importance and versatility of trans-acting enzymes that operate during peptide assembly by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.",

Adenylation (A)-domains catalyse the selection and activation of precursors, which are then loaded onto peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-domains via a phos-phopantetheine linker.4 The resultant thioester linkage remains chemically reactive for peptide bond formation \u2013 catalysed by condensation (C)-domains \u2013 but retains NRPS biosynthetic intermediates in a protein-bound form.5 In addition to these domains crucial for peptide synthesis, many NRPSs have addi-tional modi\ue103cation domains, such as epimerisation (E)-domains, which alter the stereochemistry of amino acid resi-dues and are a common hallmark of NRPS-produced peptides.6 The \ue103nal peptide product is detached from the NRPSmachinery via hydrolysis or cyclisation catalysed by a thioesterase (TE)-domain, which also offers further options to gain biological activity and compound diversity.7\u20139 The complexity of the products of NRPS biosynthesis not only stems from the direct actions of the NRPS assembly line but also from a great number of further peptide modi\ue103cations by external enzymes acting in trans.

Type II GPAs share the crosslinking pattern of Type I GPAs but contain aromatic residues at positions one and three of the peptide. Type III and IV GPAs also have aromatic residues at positions one and three of the peptide, but these are crosslinked to form an additional F-O-G ring, with differentiation between these classes due to the presence of an acyl moiety in Type IV GPAs that is absent in Type III GPAs. Balhimycin belongs to the vancomycin-type peptides (Type I GPAs), with balhimycin differing from vancomycin only with regard to the glycosylation pattern, whilst teicoplanin belongs to the Type IV GPAs (Fig. 1). The chlorine atoms present within the GPA peptides contribute signi\ue103cantly to the binding affinity of the GPAs for their target, the dipeptide terminus of lipid II.14\u201316 In both Type I and IV GPAs b-hydroxy-tyrosine (OH\u2013Tyr) and/or tyrosine (Tyr) residues are chlorinated in the positions two and six by halo-genases that belong to the class of \ue104avin (FADH2)-dependent",

        "halogenases. Most GPA gene clusters encode a single halogen-ase, which was shown in balhimycin biosynthesis to be responsible for chlorination of both positions in the peptide.17 Some GPA gene clusters possess an additional halogenase enzyme that appears to play a role in the chlorination of 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (4-Hpg) residues.18 Whilst insights into the mechanism of FADH2-dependent halogenases have been gained from structural and functional studies,19,20 reconstitu-tion of halogenase activity in vitro has proven to be difficult. Most of the FADH2-dependent halogenases characterised so far are tryptophan halogenases that act on substrates free in solu-tion.21\u201323 However, halogenases acting on PCP-bound substrates have also been characterised.24,25 In both cases chlorination of the substrate takes place before monomer incorporation to the natural product. The timing of the chlorination during GPA biosynthesis is still under debate. Four possible scenarios for the incorporation of halide atoms have been postulated and \u2013 to some extent \u2013 investigated (Fig. 2). In the \ue103rst scenario, amino acids are chlorinated prior to incorporation by the NRPS machinery; in the second, halogenation of amino acids takes place a\ue09der loading onto a PCP-domain; in the third, the peptide is chlori-nated during peptide synthesis; and in the fourth, halogenation takes place a\ue09der the peptide aglycone has been formed by P450 (Oxy) enzymes. Previously, the inactivation of the P450 mono-oxygenases responsible for GPA side chain cyclisation in vivo26\u201329 strongly suggested that halogenation would take place prior to cyclisation.

        "OnlineBhaA have shown that supplementation of the medium by chlorinated amino acids is not able to restore production of the natural, halogenated GPA if the halogenase gene is deleted.30 In contrast, supplementation of the growth medium with non-chlorinated OH\u2013Tyr could overcome the deletion of the genes essential for OH\u2013Tyr production and restore the formation of the halogenated type I GPAs.30 These results strongly suggest that scenario one, chlorination prior to incorporation by module 2 and 6 of the NRPS machinery, is not possible. Although halogenation of free amino acids has been for most part ruled out, debate concerning the other three scenarios continues. The generation of various halogenated peptide GPA intermediates in a strain where the \ue103nal conden-sation domain had been deleted points towards incorporation of the halide atoms during peptide biosynthesis.11 Precedent would suggest a mechanism of action similar to that identi\ue103ed for the halogenase enzymes from pyoluteorin synthesis24 or enediyne synthesis,25 where aminoacyl-PCP domains are the substrates for modi\ue103cation during peptide biosynthesis by the NRPS machinery; other enzymes have also been identi\ue103ed that adopt this approach.31,32 In contrast to this, in vitro studies using a P450 enzyme that crosslinks aromatic side chains from the vancomycin biosynthetic cluster (OxyBvan) showed that halide atoms in PCP-bound hexapeptide substrates made the peptides worse substrates for the \ue103rst crosslinking step,33 suggesting that chlorination would take place on the aglycone. However, these studies did not take into account the role of the X-domain in recruiting the P450 enzymes to the NRPS-bound peptide34\u201338 and recent results39 indicate that halogenated peptides are cross-linked equally well when presented by NRPS modules contain-ing the X-domain, making halogenation prior to P450 activity a distinct possibility. So far, all characterised FADH2-dependent halogenases associated with natural products produced by NRPS machin-eries act on amino acid/pyrrole substrates rather than on the \ue103nal product, strongly suggesting the PCP-bound amino acid to be the substrate for halogenases in GPA biosynthesis.

Thus, the exact timing of halogenation in GPA biosynthesis has remained unclear until this current study. Here, we are now able to show that halogenation occurs during peptide biosynthesis and that the substrates for the GPA halogenase enzymes are the PCP-bound amino acids, two OH\u2013Tyr residues at amino acid (AA) position 2 and 6 for Type I GPA and two Tyr residues at position 2 and 6 for Type IV GPAs.",
        "Results Analysis of GPA halogenation in vitro In order to assess the halogenation state of peptide precursors during GPA biosynthesis, we performed in vitro turnover experiments. In this regard, we explored the halogenase enzymes from both the balhimycin producer (Amycolatopsis balhimycina) as well as the teicoplanin producer (A. teichomy-ceticus). Both enzymes could be overproduced and puri\ue103ed in an FAD-bound form as anticipated (Fig. S1\u2020). The former enzyme was overproduced in Pseudomonas \ue104uorescens BL915 DORF1-4 containing the gene bhaA40 in the E. coli-Pseudomonas shuttle vector pCIBhis and the latter in E. coli. We prepared a range of substrates for activity assays: tyro-sine, Type IV dipeptide (4-Hpg-Tyr), hexapeptide41 (leucine (Leu)-Tyr-asparagine (Asn)-4-Hpg-4-Hpg-Tyr) and two different heptapeptides42 (Leu-Tyr-Asn-4-Hpg-4-Hpg-Tyr-Dpg and 4-Hpg-Tyr-Dpg-4-Hpg-4-Hpg-Tyr-Dpg) (Fig. 4\u20136). Substrates were loaded on various PCP domains using the promiscuous phos-phopantetheinyl transferase Sfp. Tyrosine was loaded on both PCP-domains that would be expected to interact with the hal-ogenase enzyme (PCP2 and PCP6 from a Type IV NRPS) as well as to a PCP-domain that \u2013 based on the GPA chlorination pattern \u2013 is not anticipated to interact with the halogenase enzyme (PCP1 from a Type IV NRPS) to test if the PCP-domain is responsible for guiding the halogenase to the correct substrate.",

        "OnlineDipeptide was loaded onto a PCP2 domain (Type IV) and hex-apeptide on a PCP7 domain (Type I), whilst heptapeptides were loaded on PCP7 domain either from Type I or Type IV NRPSs. Chlorination of tyrosine and dipeptide were also studied using substrates free in solution. We assessed activity using UPLC-MS with single ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple reaction moni-toring (MRM), a\ue09der cleavage of PCP-bound substrates using excess methylamine to afford the methylamide products. The halogenase from the teicoplanin system (Tcp21) dis-played activity upon PCP-bound tyrosine as a substrate. We could observe activity upon tyrosine bound to PCP-domains 1, 2 and 6 from the teicoplanin NRPSmachinery, which implies that the halogenase is not solely selective for the PCP domain and that the bound amino acid plays a role in regulating halogenase activity (Fig. 3A). Tyrosine in solution was not chlorinated by Tcp21, which suggests that the interaction with a PCP domain is crucial for catalysis. The loading efficiency differed between the three PCP-domains but the amount of chlorinated tyrosine stayed at the same level in each reaction, which shows that the turnover efficiency appears to be limited by the in vitro efficiency of Tcp21 (Fig. 3B). We also tested whether the halogenase was able to act upon dipeptide substrates. Under the conditions where we observed halogenase activity upon PCP-bound tyro-sine, we could show that neither PCP-loaded nor free dipeptide was a substrate for the enzyme (Fig. 4). We also tested longer peptides as potential substrates for halogenation, however \u2013 and as with the dipeptide substrates \u2013 we did not observe any activity upon these substrates (Fig. 5 and 6). Thus, the results of our in vitro characterisation indicate that PCP-bound amino acids are the actual substrates for halogenation during Type IV GPA biosynthesis. We did not detect activity of the balhimycin halogenase (BhaA) upon any substrates (data not shown), which we attribute to the lack of the hydroxylated side chain of the tyrosine residue (present in Type I GPAs) in the aminoacyl-PCP substrate.10",

        "Discussion The diversi\ue103cation of peptide scaffolds within NRPS biosyn-thesis provides a tremendous source of selectivity and function. Halogenation is an important example of one such modi\ue103ca-tion, and the GPAs are an excellent example of the effects halogenation can have on compound activity, as the removal of chlorine atoms from GPAs leads to signi\ue103cant reduction in binding affinity for the dipeptide terminus of lipid II.14\u201316 Hal-ogenase activity from different biosynthetic systems has been demonstrated for different types of substrates \u2013 either free in solution or carrier protein bound \u2013 with selectivity varying from one system to another.46 However, the timing and substrate selectivity of halogenation during GPA biosynthesis has previ-ously been unclear. Whilst the activity of the vancomycin hal-ogenase upon PCP-bound peptides has been reported, the use of mismatched peptide and PCP-domain within the substrates tested and the lack of cohesion with previous preliminary in vivo data led us to investigate this process further.40 In this work, we have been able to combine comprehensive results of both in vivo and in vitro experiments to show that GPA halogenase enzymes act during NRPS-mediated peptide assembly. Initially, through the in vitro characterisation of the halogenase Tcp21 from tei-coplanin biosynthesis we could clearly demonstrate that halo-genase activity was present with tyrosine only when the amino acid was presented in a PCP-bound form. Furthermore, we could show that the identity of the PCP-domain able to support tyrosine halogenation was not strictly correlated with the observed halogenation pattern of teicoplanin, which suggests that a combination of correct amino acid and PCP-domain is required for GPA halogenation during NRPS-catalysed peptide synthesis in vivo. Our results are in contrast to the results described by Schmartz et al.,40 in which the authors demon-strated the chlorination of both OH\u2013Tyr residues on a linear hexapeptide intermediate attached to the PCP domain in module-6 of the NRPS during vancomycin assembly. Chlorina-tion at this stage of GPA biosynthesis shows that this halogen-ase demonstrates the in vitro capability to modify two quite different sites within the hexapeptide-PCP substrate: this activity is challenging to reconcile with other examples of GPA halogenation (e.g. A40926,47 which displays chlorination at",

Previous in vivo gene disruption experiments of the balhimycin synthetase had revealed the presence of chlori-nated GPA peptide precursors during NRPS-catalysed peptide synthesis.11 In order to further test whether the substrates of GPA halogenation are aminoacyl-PCPs, we constructed a mutant balhimycin producer strain that had been engineered to produce the minimal GPA peptide that could contain a chlo-rine atom \u2013 a dipeptide. Following the successful construction of the strain, analysis of the peptide products and comparison to authentic standards clearly revealed the presence and con\ue103rmed the identity of the chlorinated dipeptides produced. This result indicates that halogenation during GPA biosynthesis occurs during NRPS-mediated peptide biosynthesis: as neither Tcp21 nor BhaA were active upon peptide substrates, the halo-genase activity observed during NRPS-catalysed peptide synthesis in vivo can be deduced as occurring upon PCP-bound amino acids, which matches the results of our in vitro experi-ments. The lack of activity of BhaA upon PCP-bound tyrosine is also consistent with the differences in the generation of OH\u2013Tyr residues during balhimycin and teicoplanin biosynthesis. In",

        "balhimycin biosynthesis, the correct PCP-bound amino acid substrates for BhaA would be OH\u2013Tyr and not Tyr, as OH\u2013Tyr is incorporated directly into the precursor peptide by the balhi-mycin NRPS machinery.30,45 This is signi\ue103cantly different to teicoplanin biosynthesis, in which tyrosine is initially recog-nised and incorporated into the GPA peptide by the NRPS and that is followed by subsequent generation of OH\u2013Tyr via the actions of a non-heme iron oxygenase.49 The results from BhaA in vitro experiments further demonstrate the substrate speci-\ue103city of the GPA halogenase enzymes and underlines the importance of having the correct amino acid loaded onto the PCP to enable halogenation during GPA biosynthesis.",
        "Conclusion In this work, we have obtained conclusive evidence that halo-genation occurs during NRPS-mediated peptide assembly in GPA biosynthesis. By combining the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments we have been able to show that aminoacyl-PCP substrates are recognised by halogenase enzymes and that the pairing of both the PCP-domain and bound substrate is crucial to activity: this model (see also ref. 50) helps to explain why some GPAs (such as A40926) display halogenation at different residues47 or differing levels,51 whilst others (such as pekisko-mycin)52 are lacking chlorination at residues that would",

Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria broth (LB) medium60 at 37 NoneC, supplemented with 100 mg mlNone1 ampicillin when necessary to maintain plas-mids. A. balhimycina strains were grown in R5 medium61 at 30 NoneC. Liquid/solid media were supplemented with 50 mg mlNone1 erythromycin to select for strains carrying integrated antibiotic resistance genes. P. \ue104uorescens was grown in LB medium at 30 NoneC in the presence of 50 mg mlNone1 kanamycin and 30 mg mlNone1 tetracycline for 72 h. Preparation and manipulation of DNA. Methods for isola-tion and manipulation of DNA were performed as reported.60,61 PCR fragments were isolated from agarose gels with QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Restriction endonucleases (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA and Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) were used according to their speci\ue103cations. PCR protocols for ampli\ue103cation of the fragments mod2le\ue09d, mod2right and TE PCRs were performed on a Robo Cycler Gradient 40 thermocycler from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA) with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany). For the ampli\ue103cation of the fragments mod2le\ue09d, mod2right and TE the following PCR conditions were used: initial denaturation (95 NoneC for 5 min), 30 cycles of dena-turation (95 NoneC for 2 min), annealing (69 NoneC for 1 min), and polymerisation (72 NoneC for 1 min 30 s), an additional polymeri-sation step (72 NoneC for 10 min) at the end.

A\ue09der cooling to 0 NoneC, the addition of DIC (16.2 ml, 0.105 mmol) enabled the pre-activation of Boc-(D)-leucine as the-OBt ester a\ue09der 30 min, the solution was added drop-wise to a solution containing either (2R,3R)-b-hydroxy-3-chlorotyrosine or (2S,3R)-b-hydroxy-3-chlorotyrosine (25 mg, 0.105 mmol) dissolved in 500 ml of DMF. The pH was adjusted by the addition of TEA (36 ml, 0.26 mmol) to allow the dipeptide formation to proceed at room temperature. A\ue09der 15 h, the reaction was quenched by the addition of an aqueous solution of saturated NaHCO3 and then acidi\ue103ed to pH 3 with an aqueous solution of 0.1 N HCl. The dipeptide was extracted with ethyl acetate (3None), the organic phase washed with brine (3None), dried over Na2SO4, \ue103ltered and concentrated under vacuum. The Boc protecting group was cleaved in 2 ml of a TFA/TIS/H2O solution (95%/2.5%/2.5%) without further puri\ue103cation for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the solution was concentrated under a stream of nitrogen to None0.5 ml and the peptide precipitated via addition of 5 ml cold diethyl ether. A\ue09der centrifugation washing with diethyl ether (3None), the peptide was dissolved in 95% water/5% MeCN, analyzed by LC-MS (gradient of 5% to 35% in MeCN in 30 minutes) and puri\ue103ed by RP-HPLC (gradient of 0% to 30% in MeCN in 30 minutes).

Substrate loading on PCP domains. Coenzyme A coupled tyrosine was loaded on PCP domains using 1 : 3 : 0.004 ratio of PCP domain, CoA-Tyr and Sfp R4-4 (ref. 65) respectively (10 min, RT, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mMMgCl2, 1 mMDTE). For hexa-and heptapeptide-CoAs41,42 ratio of 1 : 3 : 10 was used (1 hour, 30 NoneC). Dipeptide substrates were loaded to Trx-PCP2-domain in a modi\ue103ed one pot loading reaction.65,66 100 mM Trx-PCP2, 2.5 mM PanK and 300 mM pantetheine-dipeptide were mixed in loading buffer (100 mMTris$HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mMMgCl2, 1 mM DTE). Reaction was started by addition on 1 mM ATP (5 minutes, RT). 10 mM PPAT were added and reaction incu-bated for another 10 minutes followed by addition of 0.1 UmlNone1 of alkaline phosphatase (10 minutes, M0290, Roche). Finally, the substrate was loaded to Trx-PCP2 domain using 3 mM Sfp R4-4 (15 minutes).

Halogenase activity assay. 9 mMHalogenase and 5.8 mMYcnD were mixed in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTE) containing FAD and FMN in excess. FAD is required by the halogenase enzyme and FMN by the reduction partner. 50 mM of substrate (either in solution or loaded to a PCP domain) was added and reactions startedwith 2mMNADH (30 NoneC, 1 hour). 2 mM NADH was added again 15 minutes a\ue09der beginning of the reaction. Substrates were cleaved from PCP-domains by addition of methylamine (3 ml, 10 minutes) and proteins precipitated with formic acid (1.5 ml). Supernatants were \ue103ltered and analysed on a Acquity UPLC Peptide BEH C18 column (1.7 mM, 2.1None 100 mm, Waters) using Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometer (LCMS-8050, Shimadzu) with single ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) (Table 2).
