Chang1,2\u2021 Organofluorines represent a rapidly expanding proportion of molecules that are used in pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, agrochemicals, and materials. Despite the prevalence of fluorine in synthetic compounds, the known biological scope is limited to a single pathway that produces fluoroacetate. Here, we demonstrate that this pathway can be exploited as a source of fluorinated building blocks for introduction of fluorine into natural-product scaffolds. Specifically, we have constructed pathways involving two polyketide synthase systems, and we show that fluoroacetate can be used to incorporate fluorine into the polyketide backbone in vitro. We further show that fluorine can be inserted site-selectively and introduced into polyketide products in vivo. These results highlight the prospects for the production of complex fluorinated natural products using synthetic biology. Thecatalytic diversity of biological systemsprovides enormous potential for applica-tion of living cells to the scalable produc-tion of pharmaceuticals, fuels, and materials(1\u20134). However, the scope of innovation of livingorganisms is typically limited to functions that confer a direct advantage for cell growth, thereby maximizing biomass as the end product rather than a distinct molecule or reaction of interest. In contrast, synthetic biology approaches allow us to disconnect some of these biochemical trans-formations from cell survival and reconnect them in different ways for the targeted synthesis of al-ternative classes of compounds. One particularly interesting area of opportunity is the development of methods to introduce fluorine into complex small-molecule scaffolds, which has become a powerful strategy for the design of synthetic phar-maceuticals. Estimates indicate that 20 to 30% of drugs, including many of the top sellers, contain at least one fluorine atom (5\u20137). Recent innova-tions have expanded the scope of synthetic C\u2013F bond-formingmethodologies, but the unusual ele-mental properties of fluorine that serve as the basis for its success also continue to restrict the range of molecular structures that can be accessed (8\u201311). As such, the invention of alternative routes for the site-selective introduction of fluorine into struc-turally diverse molecules, particularly under mild conditions, remains an outstanding challenge. In comparison to synthetic small molecules, fluorine has limited distribution in naturally oc-curring organic compounds; the only organofluo-rine natural products characterized to date consist of a small set of simplemolecules associated with the fluoroacetate pathway of Streptomyces cattleya, a soil bacterium that has the ability to catalyze the formation of C\u2013F bonds from aqueous fluoride (Fig. 1A) (12, 13). Although these compounds lack the intricacy typically expected of secondary metabolites, they represent a potentially rich source of modular organofluorine building blocks for the production of complex fluorinated natural pro-ducts. In this regard, the backbones of several large classes of medicinally relevant natural products\u2014 including polyketides, isoprenoids, steroids, alka-loids, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and others\u2014are biosynthesized directly from the assembly and tai-loring of simple acetate units (Fig. 1A). Introduc-tion of the fluoroacetate monomer in place of acetate would allow us to incorporate fluorine into the backbone of these targets and create new molecular function by combining the medicinal 1Department ofMolecular andCell Biology,University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720\u20131460, USA. 2Department of Chem-istry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA94720\u20131460, USA. 3Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. 4Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. 5Department of Biochem-istry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. *These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020Present address: Department of Chemistry, Haverford College, Haverford, PA 19041, USA. \u2021Corresponding author.

For example, the introduction of fluorine via synthetic or semisynthetic routes has enabled the improvement of the clinical properties of sev-eral natural products, but this remains challeng-ing to achieve (14\u201317). Although previous studies have shown that distal fluorine substituents can be accommodated in natural-product biosyn-thetic pathways (18, 19), access to fluoromalonyl\u2013 coenzyme A (CoA), a fluorinated analog of one of nature\u2019s most powerful carbon nucleophiles, as an extender unit would enable a general meth-od for direct incorporation of fluorine into any polyketide structure. Many acetate-based natural products, poly-ketides in particular, are generated through the iterative condensation of activated thioesters, re-sulting in reactive b-keto units that condense fur-ther to produce awide range of structures (20, 21) (Fig. 1B). The structural diversity of polyketides is especially notable given that the majority of polyketides draw on only two monomers, acetate and propionate, as the extender units that form their carbon skeletons (3, 20, 22). Although polyketide synthases (PKSs) have been observed to be accommodating with regard to their starter units (23), the encoding of extender units has been found to be quite selective, and many cellu-lar acyl-CoAs are excluded from the backbone (22). However, progress in engineering extender-unit incorporation has been made by domain en-gineering (23\u201325) or incorporation via a domain that encodes a rare extender unit (17, 26). Al-though fluoroacetate serves as a starter unit in nature to produce highly toxic w-fluoro fatty acids (Fig. 1A) (13), fluorine has never been observed to date within the backbone, implying that chain-extension reactions with the fluorinated acyl-CoA do not occur in these systems. The apparent in-ability of living systems to use fluoroacetate for the biosynthesis of complex smallmolecules prob-ably results in part from the extreme properties of fluorine that affect biological and chemical synthesis. For example, the pKa (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant) of the a proton, elec-trophilicity of the carbonyl group, and the stability of the acyl-CoA and its corresponding carbanion are all highly affected by fluorine substitution. Fur-thermore, the fluoroacetyl group bears a clear similarity to the fluoromethylketone motif used for the design of covalent inhibitors, suggesting that the irreversible alkylation of active-site nucleo-philes could also create problems (27). Thus, the development of a system to incorporate fluorinated extender units could dramatically increase the range of complex structures that can be accessed but must also address the challenges in activating the fluoroacetate monomer for the downstream C\u2013C bond-forming chemistry involved in chain-extension reactions. Chain elongation in polyketides and related fatty acid\u2013based natural products relies on a separate pool of extender units formed by carboxylation of acyl-CoAs at the a position. These malonyl-CoA derivatives are then used as masked enolates for C\u2013C bond formation after decarboxylation. The fluorinated extender, fluoromalonyl-CoA, can be made through two routes: either (i) a two-step activation of the biogenic fluoroacetate or (ii) a direct ligation of CoA to fluoromalonate (Fig. 2). We reasoned that the acetate kinase (AckA)\u2013 phosphotransacetylase (Pta) pair would be effec-tive at fluoroacetate activation, as mutations in this gene locus have been shown to lead to fluoro-acetate resistance in Escherichia coli (28).

S1 and S2). Analysis of the kinetic parameters for these en-zymes with respect to fluorinated substrates in-dicated that neither appears to be affected by the fluorine substituent beyond inductive effects that alter the nucleophilicity of the carboxylic acid (AckA) or electrophilicity of the carbonyl (Pta) (29). Next, we purified the individual AccABCD subunits that make up the acetyl-CoA carboxyl-ase (ACCase) from E. coli and added these en-zymes to the AckA-Pta system to carry out the carboxylation of fluoroacetate in a one-pot reaction to generate the fluoromalonyl-CoA extender unit (Fig. 2A and fig. S1). Under these conditions, the ligation of CoA by AckA-Pta to produce the acyl-CoA is rapid, and production of the carbox-ylated product is limited by the ACCase. Although the rate of conversion is 4.5 times slower for fluo-roacetate as compared with acetate, the overall extent of reaction is similar for both congeners, which suggests that covalent inactivation of the ACCase by fluoroacetyl-CoA is not important if it occurs. In addition to the route from fluoro-acetate, we also tested a malonyl-CoA synthetase (MatB) (30) for coupling CoA directly to fluoro-malonate. Although MatB exhibits a 103-fold selectivity for malonate over fluoromalonate, fluoromalonyl-CoA is still produced at reason-able efficiency (Fig. 2B and figs. S3 and S4). Both of these systems also provide in situ re-generation capacity that can amplify product yields from polyketide synthases, and we found that either system increased polyketide produc-tion by tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase (31) compared with simple addition of malonyl-CoA (fig. S5). We next turned our attention to the use of the fluoromalonyl-CoA monomer for downstream chain-elongation reactions. To start, we exam-ined the behavior of a simple polyketide syn-thase system with regard to one cycle of chain extension and ketoreduction, which is a key functionality of larger multimodular systems for controlling downstream cyclization and rear-rangements within the polyketide backbone (Fig. 3A) (3, 20). We constructed a synthetic gene en-coding NphT7 (32), which appears to be a free-standing ketosynthase that is related at the structural level to the ketosynthase domain of more com-plex polyketide synthases (fig. S6), and we iso-lated the heterologously expressed enzyme for biochemical characterization (fig. S1). With the use of a coupled assay with an R-hydroxyl forming acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB), we found that NphT7 is competent to catalyze the formation of acetofluoroacetyl-CoA, using an acetyl-CoA starter and fluoromalonyl-CoA extender with only a five-fold defect in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM, where kcat is the turnover rate and Km is the Michaelis constant) derived from a drop in kcat with the flu-orinated substrate (Fig. 3). This lower turnover rate observed with the fluorinated substrate is pos-sibly related to the reduced reactivity of the enolate species, which would be stabilized by the fluorine substituent. However, the overall yield was com-parable for both fluorinated and nonfluorinated substrates, which shows that a decarboxylative Claisen condensationwith fluoromalonyl-CoA can take place at a similar extent of conversion com-pared tomalonyl-CoA. Furthermore, these exper-iments also show that the 2-fluoro-3-keto motif produced with the fluoromalonyl-CoA extender can be accepted by ketoreductases, as PhaB is ca-pable of efficiently reducing the acetofluoroacetyl-CoA substrate (fig. S7). The 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the reduced product indicate that both diastereomers are produced in this reaction (fig. S7), which may re-sult from lack of stereochemical preference of NphT7 with respect to the fluorine substituent or from racemization of the product before reduc-tion by PhaB. Although PhaB does not appear to show diastereoselectivity with respect to the fluorine group, the polyketide synthase keto-reductases are known to be selective with regard to their native a substituent and could potentially carry out the stereochemical resolution of the fluorine modification upon reduction (33). With this information in hand, we sought to extend our biosynthetic method for fluorine intro-duction to more complex polyketide synthase sys-tems, which use the chain-elongation reaction for the biosynthesis of many bioactive and clinically important natural products, such as erythromy-cin and rapamycin (3, 20). Of the multimodular polyketide systems, 6-deoxyerythronolide B syn-thase (DEBS) is probably the best understood and is responsible for production of the erythromycin precursor (34). We therefore focused our studies on the sixth module of DEBS, including the ter-minal thioesterase (DEBSMod6+TE) (35). Using a diketide substrate [natural diketide N-acetyl cyste-amine thioester (NDK-SNAC)], DEBSMod6+TE can catalyze a single round of chain elongation with its native methylmalonyl-CoA extender unit and then cyclize the tethered product to form a methyltriketide lactone (TKL) (Fig. 4A, R = CH3; Fig. 4B, 1; and fig. S8) (36). We found that DEBSMod6+TE is also able to accept the fluori-nated monomer in chain-extension catalysis to form the 2-fluoro-2-desmethyltriketide lactone (F-TKL) and incorporate fluorine into the polyketide back-bone (Fig. 4B, 2 to 4; and fig. S9). The identity of the F-TKL was established by comparison to an authentic synthetic standard using reverse-phase liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) monitored by electrospray ionization (ESI) and further confirmed by characterization of the isolated compound by high-resolution MS, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, and 19F NMR spectroscopy (figs.

S12 and S13), this ratio appears to be set by the compound\u2019s stereoelec-tronic factors rather than the stereochemical pref-erence of DEBSMod6+TE, as the F-TKL is fully enolized in aqueous solution. The F-TKL can also be produced directly from fluoroacetate using the AckA-Pta/ACCase activation system in either a multistage (Fig. 4B, 5 and 6) or single-pot re-action (Fig. 4B, 7 and 8) with DEBSMod6+TE in a similar yield to the MatB reaction, which allows us to connect fluorinated polyketide production directly to the biosynthetically available fluori-nated building block (Fig. 1A and scheme S1). In contrast to the chain-extension reaction catalyzed by NphT7, DEBSMod6+TE does not in-corporate fluorinated extender units into the triketide lactone product as efficiently as its na-tive methylmalonyl-CoA extender. Preliminary studies indicate that the reduced efficiency of DEBSMod6+TE with the fluorinated extender is not due to covalent inactivation of the enzyme (fig. S14), but rather to the more complex bio-chemistry of polyketide synthases with regard to monomer selection (37). Extender unit hydrol-ysis, which occurs even for the native substrate (table S2), appears to limit fluoromalonyl-CoA incorporation based on the observations that MatB and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are needed for fluoromalonyl-CoA regeneration and that fluoromalonate remains the major organo-fluorine species, even in their presence (fig. S15). The fluoromalonyl-CoA extender is, however, in-corporated at higher efficiency by DEBSMod6+TE than malonyl-CoA (R = H), which is reported to be naturally excluded by DEBS (38). In fact, DEBSMod6+TE produces at least 10 times more F-TKL than H-TKL in a direct competition ex-periment with equimolar amounts (1 mM) of fluoromalonyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA (table S3). To address the issue of site-or regioselective fluorine incorporation, we turned our attention to exploiting the greater reactivity of the fluorinated extender unit toward acylation reactions. In this regard, we hypothesized that it would be possible for a fluorinated substrate to selectively acylate either the acyltransferase (AT) or acyl carrier protein domains of individual DEBS modules in the presence of a catalytically compromised or inactive AT domain, an approach that has been shown to facilitate malonyl incorporation by DEBS (39). Experiments with DEBSMod6+TE showed that not only does F-TKLyield increase as expected, but fluorine selectivity also improves upon introduction of a key S2107A (Ser2107\u2192 Ala2107) mutation, reversing the selectivity of the wild-type module (Fig. 4C). When the NDK-SNAC substrate is used with its native module, DEBSMod2, in conjunction with the analogous S2652A mutation, extension with fluoromalonyl-CoA to form F-TKL reaches 30% efficiency comparedwithmethylmalonyl-CoA (fig. S16). Fur-thermore, we found that the stand-alone trans-AT from the disorazole polyketide synthase (40, 41) accepts fluoromalonyl-CoA and can further en-hance F-TKL formation by the AT-null mutant (Fig. 4C). Using this approach,we began to explore the possibility of site-selective fluorine incorpo-ration with a mini-PKS model system, consist-ing of DEBSMod2 and DEBSMod3+TE, that was designed to carry out two chain-extension re-actions from the NDK-SNAC substrate (42). Using the appropriate AT-null constructs, we were able to observe exclusive production of either regio-isomer of the fluoro-methyl tetraketide lactone (tetraKL). The identity of the 2-fluoro-4-methyl tetraKL and 2-methyl-4-fluoro tetraKL was es-tablished by both high-resolution ESI-MS and LC-MS on the basis of their different retention times, as well as their mass fragmentation pat-terns, which are consistent with the incorpora-tion of fluorine at the expected sites (Fig. 4D and fig. S17). These studies also indicate that further chain extension after fluorine insertion can be achieved and that fluorinated intermedi-ates could potentially be tolerated in downstream reactions. This observation is consistent with pre-vious work that has shown that intermediates with non-native substituents, including fluorine, can be extended and tailored to the final structure (3, 17\u201320, 23) and gives promise that larger flu-orinated polyketide targets may be accessible through this approach. The observed selectivity for fluoromalonyl-over malonyl-CoAextender units suggests that polyketide chain-extension reactions with fluoromalonyl-CoA could possibly be catalyzed in vivo in E. coli, which contains a sizable malonyl-CoA pool (~35 mM) (43) but almost no methylmalonyl-CoA (44, 45). We carried out preliminary 19F-NMR studies of cells expressingMatB, NphT7, and PhaB and fed with nontoxic levels of fluoromalonate. Analysis of the media and cell extracts indicated that flux through fluoromalonyl-CoA could reach 100 mM to 1 mM, which is sufficient for use by PKSs in live cells (table S4). Next, we tested the ability of DEBSMod6+TE to catalyze chain elongation in cell lysates prepared from E. coli BAP1 coex-pressing DEBSMod6+TE and MatB. Under these conditions, F-TKL is produced with no observ-able H-TKL upon addition of only NDK-SNAC, fluoromalonate, CoA, ATP, and the ATP regen-eration system (fig. S18A). Negative controls with either no DEBSMod6+TE/MatB expressed or no NDK-SNAC substrate show no production of F-TKL (fig. S18A). These results demonstrate that the intracellular level of expression of the DEBSMod6+TE and MatB enzymes is sufficient for the incorporation of the fluorinated extender unit. They also further imply that fluorine could be introduced into the polyketide backbone in-side living cells, which are capable of generat-ing ATP through normal metabolic processes.

Moreover, F-TKL can also be produced directly in cell culture with the simple addition of a mix-ture of both substrates to the media after induc-tion of DEBSMod6+TE and MatB (fig. S18C). Taken together, these studies show that the nat-ural selectivity of the polyketide synthase allows for the site-selective introduction of fluorine over hydrogen into the polyketide backbone in-side living cells. Using engineered pathways to link simple bio-genic organofluorine building blocks into more complex fluorinated small-molecule targets, we have demonstrated that we can expand the fluo-rine chemistry of living systems. Because of the modular nature of the biosynthetic pathways used to produce polyketides and related acetate-derived natural products, these findings open the door to general strategies for exploring the fluorine syn-thetic biology of complex natural products.

T. van de Meerakker,5 Christian Naulin,1,2 Fran\u00e7ois Lique,3* Michel Costes1,2* Partial wave resonances predicted to occur in bimolecular collision processes have proven challenging to observe experimentally. Here, we report crossed-beam experiments and quantum-scattering calculations on inelastic collisions between ground-state O2 and H2 molecules that provide state-to-state cross sections for rotational excitation of O2 (rotational state N = 1, j = 0) to O2 (N = 1, j = 1) in the vicinity of the thermodynamic threshold at 3.96 centimeter-1. The close agreement between experimental and theoretical results confirms the classically forbidden character of this collision-induced transition, which occurs exclusively in a purely quantum mechanical regime via shape and Feshbach resonances arising from partial waves with total angular momentum ( J) = 2 to 4. The accurate description of collisions be-tween individual molecules remains along-standing goal in physical chemistry. In a classical picture, the outcome of a collision is determined by the interaction potential and ini-tial conditions such as relative velocity and im-pact parameter, that is, the distance of closest approach between the molecules in the absence of any interaction. Surely, molecules are quantum objects in nature, and the collisions must be de-scribed in terms of interfering quantum-scattering states, or partial waves, instead. Each partial wave is the quantum mechanical analog of a classical trajectory with a given impact parameter and is characterized by a definite value of total angular momentum, J, which is conserved throughout the collision (1). The contribution of individual partial waves to the scattering cross sections constitutes the ultimate information that can be obtained about a collision event. Whereas molecular scattering processes are nowadays described successfully by quantum mechanical methods throughout, the direct observation of individual partial waves in molecular collision experiments remains highly challenging. In fact, partial waves can only be distinguished when giving rise to scattering reso-nances that manifest as resolved peaks in dif-ferential or integral cross sections (DCSs and ICSs) as measured in crossed-beam experiments. Such very rare findings then provide a unique insight in the most critical part of the potential energy surface (PES), the transition state region (2). How-ever, in most cases, the collision energy spread and the participation of many overlapping par-tial waves corresponding to the energetically al-lowed values of J tend to average the individual resonance signatures and still render them elu-sive to experimental observation. Partial wave resonances were first observed for a few elastic collisions that involve simple atoms (3\u20135) and then for the F + HD\u2192 HF + D system. In this textbook three-atom reaction, the resonances could be identified by comparison of experimentally determined cross sections with the outcome of high-level electronic structure and quantum-scattering calculations. A clear oscil-latory structure assigned to J = 12 to 14 partial waves appears in the collision energy dependence of the state and angle-resolved DCS (6), where-as a steplike feature characterizes the resonance behavior of the total ICS (7). More recently, reso-nance structures have been revealed in total ICSs for Penning ionization reactions of metastable He with H2 or Ar in the cold regime (8) and in state-to-state ICSs for low-energy inelastic scat-tering of CO with H2 (9). Yet, the identification of the contributing partial waves suffered from imperfect agreement with theory in the latter studies. Here, we report a joint experimental and theoretical study on O2\u2013H2 inelastic collisions for O2 (N = 1, j = 0 \u2192 N = 1, j = 1) rotational ex-citation, a transition which violates the semi-classical propensity rules for rotational energy transfer involving amolecule in a 3S state (10). The results demonstrate the purely quantum mechan-ical nature of the process and offer a complete characterization of fully resolved partial wave res-onances with close agreement between theory and experiment. We performed our experiments with a crossed-beam apparatus, which allowed us to tune the collision energy (the relative translational energy of colliding partners with reduced mass m and relative velocity vr) by varying the beam inter-section angle, c, between 12.5\u00b0 and 90\u00b0: ET = \u00bdmvr 2 = \u00bdm(vO2 2 + vH2 2 -2vO2vH2cosc) (9, 11). H2 and O2 beams with low and matched ve-locities and high velocity resolution and quantum state purity were obtained by using cryogenically cooled Even-Lavie fast-pulsed valves (12) [see table S1 (13)]. Neat beams of para-H2 and normal-H2 were used and were characterized in the crossing region by 3 + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) time-of-flightmass spectrom-etry using three-photon (C1Pu, v = 0\u2190 X 1Sg +, v = 0)R branch transitions near 99,150 cm\u20131 (14). Populations >95% for j = 0 and <5% for j = 1were deduced when using freshly prepared samples of para\u2013H2 and 25% j = 0, 75% j = 1 when using normal\u2013H2. The O2 beam (0.3% O2 in He) was probed by using 2 + 1 (3S0 \u2013, v= 2\u2190X3Sg \u2013, v= 0) and (3S1 \u2013, v = 2 \u2190 X3Sg \u2013, v = 0) REMPI transitions around 88,900 cm\u20131 (15). The relative populations of the three fine-structure components of ground rotational state N = 1 were estimated to be >85% in j = 0, <15% in j = 2 atE1,2 = 2.08 cm \u20131, and <0.5% in j = 1 at E1,1 = 3.96 cm \u20131, whereas those of first excited rotational state N = 3 were negligible (13). Cross-section measurements at-tributed to N = 1, j = 0\u2192 N = 1, j = 1 rotational energy transfer were performed by probing the collision-induced population in the N = 1, j = 1 level as a function of the crossing angle. The initial residual population inN = 1, j = 1 level was offset by shot-to-shot background subtraction when triggering the probe laser and the O2 beam at 10Hz with the H2 beam at 5 Hz. The integral cross sec-tions for O2\u2013para-H2 collisions between ET = 3.7 cm\u20131 and 20 cm\u20131 are displayed in Figs. 1A and 2. Those for O2\u2013normal-H2 collisions are shown in Fig. 2.

Despite the prevalence of fluorine in synthetic compounds, the known biological scope is limited to a single pathway that produces fluoroacetate. Here, we demonstrate that this pathway can be exploited as a source of fluorinated building blocks for introduction of fluorine into natural-product scaffolds. Specifically, we have constructed pathways involving two polyketide synthase systems, and we show that fluoroacetate can be used to incorporate fluorine into the polyketide backbone in vitro. We further show that fluorine can be inserted site-selectively and introduced into polyketide products in vivo. These results highlight the prospects for the production of complex fluorinated natural products using synthetic biology.",

In contrast, synthetic biology approaches allow us to disconnect some of these biochemical trans-formations from cell survival and reconnect them in different ways for the targeted synthesis of al-ternative classes of compounds. One particularly interesting area of opportunity is the development of methods to introduce fluorine into complex small-molecule scaffolds, which has become a",
        "powerful strategy for the design of synthetic phar-maceuticals. Estimates indicate that 20 to 30% of drugs, including many of the top sellers, contain at least one fluorine atom (5\u20137). Recent innova-tions have expanded the scope of synthetic C\u2013F bond-formingmethodologies, but the unusual ele-mental properties of fluorine that serve as the basis for its success also continue to restrict the range of molecular structures that can be accessed (8\u201311). As such, the invention of alternative routes for the site-selective introduction of fluorine into struc-turally diverse molecules, particularly under mild conditions, remains an outstanding challenge.",
        "In comparison to synthetic small molecules, fluorine has limited distribution in naturally oc-curring organic compounds; the only organofluo-rine natural products characterized to date consist of a small set of simplemolecules associated with the fluoroacetate pathway of Streptomyces cattleya, a soil bacterium that has the ability to catalyze the formation of C\u2013F bonds from aqueous fluoride (Fig. 1A) (12, 13). Although these compounds lack the intricacy typically expected of secondary metabolites, they represent a potentially rich source of modular organofluorine building blocks for the production of complex fluorinated natural pro-ducts. In this regard, the backbones of several large classes of medicinally relevant natural products\u2014 including polyketides, isoprenoids, steroids, alka-loids, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and others\u2014are biosynthesized directly from the assembly and tai-loring of simple acetate units (Fig. 1A).

        "chemistry advantages of fluorine with the struc-tural complexity and bioactivity of natural products. For example, the introduction of fluorine via synthetic or semisynthetic routes has enabled the improvement of the clinical properties of sev-eral natural products, but this remains challeng-ing to achieve (14\u201317). Although previous studies have shown that distal fluorine substituents can be accommodated in natural-product biosyn-thetic pathways (18, 19), access to fluoromalonyl\u2013 coenzyme A (CoA), a fluorinated analog of one of nature\u2019s most powerful carbon nucleophiles, as an extender unit would enable a general meth-od for direct incorporation of fluorine into any polyketide structure.",
        "Many acetate-based natural products, poly-ketides in particular, are generated through the iterative condensation of activated thioesters, re-sulting in reactive b-keto units that condense fur-ther to produce awide range of structures (20, 21) (Fig. 1B). The structural diversity of polyketides is especially notable given that the majority of polyketides draw on only two monomers, acetate and propionate, as the extender units that form their carbon skeletons (3, 20, 22). Although polyketide synthases (PKSs) have been observed",
        "to be accommodating with regard to their starter units (23), the encoding of extender units has been found to be quite selective, and many cellu-lar acyl-CoAs are excluded from the backbone (22). However, progress in engineering extender-unit incorporation has been made by domain en-gineering (23\u201325) or incorporation via a domain that encodes a rare extender unit (17, 26). Al-though fluoroacetate serves as a starter unit in nature to produce highly toxic w-fluoro fatty acids (Fig. 1A) (13), fluorine has never been observed to date within the backbone, implying that chain-extension reactions with the fluorinated acyl-CoA do not occur in these systems. The apparent in-ability of living systems to use fluoroacetate for the biosynthesis of complex smallmolecules prob-ably results in part from the extreme properties of fluorine that affect biological and chemical synthesis. For example, the pKa (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant) of the a proton, elec-trophilicity of the carbonyl group, and the stability of the acyl-CoA and its corresponding carbanion are all highly affected by fluorine substitution. Fur-thermore, the fluoroacetyl group bears a clear similarity to the fluoromethylketone motif used for the design of covalent inhibitors, suggesting",
        "that the irreversible alkylation of active-site nucleo-philes could also create problems (27). Thus, the development of a system to incorporate fluorinated extender units could dramatically increase the range of complex structures that can be accessed but must also address the challenges in activating the fluoroacetate monomer for the downstream C\u2013C bond-forming chemistry involved in chain-extension reactions.",
        "Chain elongation in polyketides and related fatty acid\u2013based natural products relies on a separate pool of extender units formed by carboxylation of acyl-CoAs at the a position. These malonyl-CoA derivatives are then used as masked enolates for C\u2013C bond formation after decarboxylation. The fluorinated extender, fluoromalonyl-CoA, can be made through two routes: either (i) a two-step activation of the biogenic fluoroacetate or (ii) a direct ligation of CoA to fluoromalonate (Fig. 2). We reasoned that the acetate kinase (AckA)\u2013 phosphotransacetylase (Pta) pair would be effec-tive at fluoroacetate activation, as mutations in this gene locus have been shown to lead to fluoro-acetate resistance in Escherichia coli (28). The enzymes fromE. coliwere overexpressed and char-acterized biochemically, confirming that AckA",

        "and Pta serve as an effective activation system to rapidly produce both acetyl-and fluoroacetyl-CoA in nearly quantitative yield (figs. S1 and S2). Analysis of the kinetic parameters for these en-zymes with respect to fluorinated substrates in-dicated that neither appears to be affected by the fluorine substituent beyond inductive effects that alter the nucleophilicity of the carboxylic acid (AckA) or electrophilicity of the carbonyl (Pta) (29). Next, we purified the individual AccABCD subunits that make up the acetyl-CoA carboxyl-ase (ACCase) from E. coli and added these en-zymes to the AckA-Pta system to carry out the carboxylation of fluoroacetate in a one-pot reaction to generate the fluoromalonyl-CoA extender unit (Fig. 2A and fig. S1). Under these conditions, the ligation of CoA by AckA-Pta to produce the acyl-CoA is rapid, and production of the carbox-ylated product is limited by the ACCase. Although the rate of conversion is 4.5 times slower for fluo-roacetate as compared with acetate, the overall extent of reaction is similar for both congeners, which suggests that covalent inactivation of the ACCase by fluoroacetyl-CoA is not important if it occurs. In addition to the route from fluoro-acetate, we also tested a malonyl-CoA synthetase (MatB) (30) for coupling CoA directly to fluoro-malonate. Although MatB exhibits a 103-fold selectivity for malonate over fluoromalonate,",
        "fluoromalonyl-CoA is still produced at reason-able efficiency (Fig. 2B and figs. S3 and S4). Both of these systems also provide in situ re-generation capacity that can amplify product yields from polyketide synthases, and we found that either system increased polyketide produc-tion by tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase (31) compared with simple addition of malonyl-CoA (fig. S5). We next turned our attention to the use of the fluoromalonyl-CoA monomer for downstream chain-elongation reactions. To start, we exam-ined the behavior of a simple polyketide syn-thase system with regard to one cycle of chain extension and ketoreduction, which is a key functionality of larger multimodular systems for controlling downstream cyclization and rear-rangements within the polyketide backbone (Fig. 3A) (3, 20). We constructed a synthetic gene en-coding NphT7 (32), which appears to be a free-standing ketosynthase that is related at the structural level to the ketosynthase domain of more com-plex polyketide synthases (fig. S6), and we iso-lated the heterologously expressed enzyme for biochemical characterization (fig. S1). With the use of a coupled assay with an R-hydroxyl forming acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB), we found that NphT7 is competent to catalyze the formation of acetofluoroacetyl-CoA, using an acetyl-CoA starter",
        "and fluoromalonyl-CoA extender with only a five-fold defect in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM, where kcat is the turnover rate and Km is the Michaelis constant) derived from a drop in kcat with the flu-orinated substrate (Fig. 3). This lower turnover rate observed with the fluorinated substrate is pos-sibly related to the reduced reactivity of the enolate species, which would be stabilized by the fluorine substituent. However, the overall yield was com-parable for both fluorinated and nonfluorinated substrates, which shows that a decarboxylative Claisen condensationwith fluoromalonyl-CoA can take place at a similar extent of conversion com-pared tomalonyl-CoA. Furthermore, these exper-iments also show that the 2-fluoro-3-keto motif produced with the fluoromalonyl-CoA extender can be accepted by ketoreductases, as PhaB is ca-pable of efficiently reducing the acetofluoroacetyl-CoA substrate (fig. S7). The 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the reduced product indicate that both diastereomers are produced in this reaction (fig. S7), which may re-sult from lack of stereochemical preference of NphT7 with respect to the fluorine substituent or from racemization of the product before reduc-tion by PhaB. Although PhaB does not appear to show diastereoselectivity with respect to the fluorine group, the polyketide synthase keto-reductases are known to be selective with regard to their native a substituent and could potentially carry out the stereochemical resolution of the fluorine modification upon reduction (33).",
        "With this information in hand, we sought to extend our biosynthetic method for fluorine intro-duction to more complex polyketide synthase sys-tems, which use the chain-elongation reaction for the biosynthesis of many bioactive and clinically important natural products, such as erythromy-cin and rapamycin (3, 20). Of the multimodular polyketide systems, 6-deoxyerythronolide B syn-thase (DEBS) is probably the best understood and is responsible for production of the erythromycin precursor (34). We therefore focused our studies on the sixth module of DEBS, including the ter-minal thioesterase (DEBSMod6+TE) (35). Using a diketide substrate [natural diketide N-acetyl cyste-amine thioester (NDK-SNAC)], DEBSMod6+TE can catalyze a single round of chain elongation with its native methylmalonyl-CoA extender unit and then cyclize the tethered product to form a methyltriketide lactone (TKL) (Fig. 4A, R = CH3; Fig. 4B, 1; and fig. S8) (36). We found that DEBSMod6+TE is also able to accept the fluori-nated monomer in chain-extension catalysis to form the 2-fluoro-2-desmethyltriketide lactone (F-TKL) and incorporate fluorine into the polyketide back-bone (Fig. 4B, 2 to 4; and fig. S9). The identity of the F-TKL was established by comparison to an authentic synthetic standard using reverse-phase liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) monitored by electrospray ionization (ESI) and further confirmed by characterization of the isolated compound by high-resolution MS, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, and 19F NMR spectroscopy (figs.

S12 and S13), this ratio appears to be set by the compound\u2019s stereoelec-tronic factors rather than the stereochemical pref-erence of DEBSMod6+TE, as the F-TKL is fully enolized in aqueous solution. The F-TKL can also be produced directly from fluoroacetate using the AckA-Pta/ACCase activation system in either a multistage (Fig. 4B, 5 and 6) or single-pot re-action (Fig. 4B, 7 and 8) with DEBSMod6+TE in a similar yield to the MatB reaction, which allows us to connect fluorinated polyketide production directly to the biosynthetically available fluori-nated building block (Fig. 1A and scheme S1).",
        "In contrast to the chain-extension reaction catalyzed by NphT7, DEBSMod6+TE does not in-corporate fluorinated extender units into the triketide lactone product as efficiently as its na-tive methylmalonyl-CoA extender. Preliminary studies indicate that the reduced efficiency of DEBSMod6+TE with the fluorinated extender is not due to covalent inactivation of the enzyme (fig. S14), but rather to the more complex bio-chemistry of polyketide synthases with regard to monomer selection (37). Extender unit hydrol-ysis, which occurs even for the native substrate (table S2), appears to limit fluoromalonyl-CoA incorporation based on the observations that MatB and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are needed for fluoromalonyl-CoA regeneration and that fluoromalonate remains the major organo-fluorine species, even in their presence (fig. S15). The fluoromalonyl-CoA extender is, however, in-corporated at higher efficiency by DEBSMod6+TE than malonyl-CoA (R = H), which is reported to be naturally excluded by DEBS (38). In fact, DEBSMod6+TE produces at least 10 times more F-TKL than H-TKL in a direct competition ex-periment with equimolar amounts (1 mM) of fluoromalonyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA (table S3).",
        "To address the issue of site-or regioselective fluorine incorporation, we turned our attention to exploiting the greater reactivity of the fluorinated extender unit toward acylation reactions. In this regard, we hypothesized that it would be possible for a fluorinated substrate to selectively acylate either the acyltransferase (AT) or acyl carrier protein domains of individual DEBS modules in the presence of a catalytically compromised or inactive AT domain, an approach that has been shown to facilitate malonyl incorporation by DEBS (39). Experiments with DEBSMod6+TE showed that not only does F-TKLyield increase as expected, but fluorine selectivity also improves upon introduction of a key S2107A (Ser2107\u2192 Ala2107) mutation, reversing the selectivity of the wild-type module (Fig. 4C). When the NDK-SNAC substrate is used with its native module, DEBSMod2, in conjunction with the analogous S2652A mutation, extension with fluoromalonyl-CoA to form F-TKL reaches 30% efficiency comparedwithmethylmalonyl-CoA (fig. S16). Fur-thermore, we found that the stand-alone trans-AT from the disorazole polyketide synthase (40, 41) accepts fluoromalonyl-CoA and can further en-",
        "hance F-TKL formation by the AT-null mutant (Fig. 4C). Using this approach,we began to explore the possibility of site-selective fluorine incorpo-ration with a mini-PKS model system, consist-ing of DEBSMod2 and DEBSMod3+TE, that was designed to carry out two chain-extension re-actions from the NDK-SNAC substrate (42). Using the appropriate AT-null constructs, we were able to observe exclusive production of either regio-isomer of the fluoro-methyl tetraketide lactone (tetraKL). The identity of the 2-fluoro-4-methyl tetraKL and 2-methyl-4-fluoro tetraKL was es-tablished by both high-resolution ESI-MS and LC-MS on the basis of their different retention times, as well as their mass fragmentation pat-terns, which are consistent with the incorpora-tion of fluorine at the expected sites (Fig. 4D and fig. S17). These studies also indicate that further chain extension after fluorine insertion can be achieved and that fluorinated intermedi-ates could potentially be tolerated in downstream reactions. This observation is consistent with pre-vious work that has shown that intermediates with non-native substituents, including fluorine, can be extended and tailored to the final structure (3, 17\u201320, 23) and gives promise that larger flu-orinated polyketide targets may be accessible through this approach. The observed selectivity for fluoromalonyl-over malonyl-CoAextender units suggests that polyketide chain-extension reactions with fluoromalonyl-CoA could possibly be catalyzed in vivo in E. coli, which contains a sizable malonyl-CoA pool (~35 mM)",
        "(43) but almost no methylmalonyl-CoA (44, 45). We carried out preliminary 19F-NMR studies of cells expressingMatB, NphT7, and PhaB and fed with nontoxic levels of fluoromalonate. Analysis of the media and cell extracts indicated that flux through fluoromalonyl-CoA could reach 100 mM to 1 mM, which is sufficient for use by PKSs in live cells (table S4). Next, we tested the ability of DEBSMod6+TE to catalyze chain elongation in cell lysates prepared from E. coli BAP1 coex-pressing DEBSMod6+TE and MatB. Under these conditions, F-TKL is produced with no observ-able H-TKL upon addition of only NDK-SNAC, fluoromalonate, CoA, ATP, and the ATP regen-eration system (fig. S18A). Negative controls with either no DEBSMod6+TE/MatB expressed or no NDK-SNAC substrate show no production of F-TKL (fig. S18A). These results demonstrate that the intracellular level of expression of the DEBSMod6+TE and MatB enzymes is sufficient for the incorporation of the fluorinated extender unit. They also further imply that fluorine could be introduced into the polyketide backbone in-side living cells, which are capable of generat-ing ATP through normal metabolic processes. Therefore, we cultured E. coliBAP1 coexpressing DEBSMod6+TE and MatB and harvested the cells after induction. These cells were then fed with the fluoromalonate precursor, which resulted in the production of F-TKL upon addition of NDK-SNAC (Fig. 4B, 9; and fig. S18B). The identity of the F-TKL under these conditions was established by LC-MS, co-injection with an",

Here, we report crossed-beam experiments and quantum-scattering calculations on inelastic collisions between ground-state O2 and H2 molecules that provide state-to-state cross sections for rotational excitation of O2 (rotational state N = 1, j = 0) to O2 (N = 1, j = 1) in the vicinity of the thermodynamic threshold at 3.96 centimeter-1. The close agreement between experimental and theoretical results confirms the classically forbidden character of this collision-induced transition, which occurs exclusively in a purely quantum mechanical regime via shape and Feshbach resonances arising from partial waves with total angular momentum ( J) = 2 to 4.",

        "In a classical picture, the outcome of a collision is determined by the interaction potential and ini-tial conditions such as relative velocity and im-pact parameter, that is, the distance of closest approach between the molecules in the absence of any interaction. Surely, molecules are quantum objects in nature, and the collisions must be de-scribed in terms of interfering quantum-scattering states, or partial waves, instead. Each partial wave is the quantum mechanical analog of a classical trajectory with a given impact parameter and is characterized by a definite value of total angular momentum, J, which is conserved throughout the collision (1).",
        "The contribution of individual partial waves to the scattering cross sections constitutes the ultimate information that can be obtained about a collision event. Whereas molecular scattering processes are nowadays described successfully by quantum mechanical methods throughout, the direct observation of individual partial waves in",
        "molecular collision experiments remains highly challenging. In fact, partial waves can only be distinguished when giving rise to scattering reso-nances that manifest as resolved peaks in dif-ferential or integral cross sections (DCSs and ICSs) as measured in crossed-beam experiments. Such very rare findings then provide a unique insight in the most critical part of the potential energy surface (PES), the transition state region (2). How-ever, in most cases, the collision energy spread and the participation of many overlapping par-tial waves corresponding to the energetically al-lowed values of J tend to average the individual resonance signatures and still render them elu-sive to experimental observation. Partial wave resonances were first observed for a few elastic collisions that involve simple atoms (3\u20135) and then for the F + HD\u2192 HF + D system. In this textbook three-atom reaction, the resonances could be identified by comparison of experimentally determined cross sections with the outcome of high-level electronic structure and quantum-scattering calculations. A clear oscil-latory structure assigned to J = 12 to 14 partial waves appears in the collision energy dependence of the state and angle-resolved DCS (6), where-as a steplike feature characterizes the resonance behavior of the total ICS (7). More recently, reso-nance structures have been revealed in total ICSs for Penning ionization reactions of metastable He with H2 or Ar in the cold regime (8) and in state-to-state ICSs for low-energy inelastic scat-tering of CO with H2 (9). Yet, the identification of the contributing partial waves suffered from",
        "imperfect agreement with theory in the latter studies. Here, we report a joint experimental and theoretical study on O2\u2013H2 inelastic collisions for O2 (N = 1, j = 0 \u2192 N = 1, j = 1) rotational ex-citation, a transition which violates the semi-classical propensity rules for rotational energy transfer involving amolecule in a 3S state (10). The results demonstrate the purely quantum mechan-ical nature of the process and offer a complete characterization of fully resolved partial wave res-onances with close agreement between theory and experiment.",
        "We performed our experiments with a crossed-beam apparatus, which allowed us to tune the collision energy (the relative translational energy of colliding partners with reduced mass m and relative velocity vr) by varying the beam inter-section angle, c, between 12.5\u00b0 and 90\u00b0: ET = \u00bdmvr 2 = \u00bdm(vO2 2 + vH2 2 -2vO2vH2cosc) (9, 11). H2 and O2 beams with low and matched ve-locities and high velocity resolution and quantum state purity were obtained by using cryogenically cooled Even-Lavie fast-pulsed valves (12) [see table S1 (13)]. Neat beams of para-H2 and normal-H2 were used and were characterized in the crossing region by 3 + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) time-of-flightmass spectrom-etry using three-photon (C1Pu, v = 0\u2190 X 1Sg +, v = 0)R branch transitions near 99,150 cm\u20131 (14).

The O2 beam (0.3% O2 in He) was probed by using 2 + 1 (3S0 \u2013, v= 2\u2190X3Sg \u2013, v= 0) and (3S1 \u2013, v = 2 \u2190 X3Sg \u2013, v = 0) REMPI transitions around 88,900 cm\u20131 (15). The relative populations of the three fine-structure components of ground rotational state N = 1 were estimated to be >85% in j = 0, <15% in j = 2 atE1,2 = 2.08 cm \u20131, and <0.5% in j = 1 at E1,1 = 3.96 cm \u20131, whereas those of first excited rotational state N = 3 were negligible (13). Cross-section measurements at-tributed to N = 1, j = 0\u2192 N = 1, j = 1 rotational energy transfer were performed by probing the collision-induced population in the N = 1, j = 1 level as a function of the crossing angle. The initial residual population inN = 1, j = 1 level was offset by shot-to-shot background subtraction when triggering the probe laser and the O2 beam at 10Hz with the H2 beam at 5 Hz. The integral cross sec-tions for O2\u2013para-H2 collisions between ET = 3.7 cm\u20131 and 20 cm\u20131 are displayed in Figs. 1A and 2. Those for O2\u2013normal-H2 collisions are shown in Fig. 2. The excitation function displays well-",
