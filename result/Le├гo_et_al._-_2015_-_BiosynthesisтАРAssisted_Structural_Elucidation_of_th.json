Le\u00bco, Hitomi Nakamura, Margarida Costa, Alban R. Pereira, Ros\u0082rio Martins, Vitor Vasconcelos,* William H. Gerwick,* and Emily P. Balskus* Abstract: The isolation of the bartolosides, unprecedented cyanobacterial glycolipids featuring aliphatic chains with chlorine substituents and C-glycosyl moieties, is reported. Their chlorinated dialkylresorcinol (DAR) core presented a major structural-elucidation challenge. To overcome this, we discovered the bartoloside (brt) biosynthetic gene cluster and linked it to the natural products through in vitro character-ization of the DAR-forming ketosynthase and aromatase. Bioinformatic analysis also revealed a novel potential halo-genase. Knowledge of the bartoloside biosynthesis constrained the DAR core structure by defining key pathway intermediates, ultimately allowing us to determine the full structures of the bartolosides. This work illustrates the power of genomics to enable the use of biosynthetic information for structure elucidation. As ancient photoautotrophs, cyanobacteria have a differ-entiated ecophysiology among prokaryotes[1] that is abun-dantly reflected in their secondary metabolite diversity.[2] We have explored the chemical diversity of an in-house culture collection of cyanobacteria[3] and herein report the discovery of four unusual secondary metabolites and the use of biosynthesis in their structure elucidation. Examination of a fractionated crude organic extract from the filamentous cyanobacterium Nodosilinea sp. LEGE 06102 led to the 1H NMR spectroscopy guided isolation of barto-loside A (1, 2.0 mg; Figure 1a). Intriguingly, analogous metabolites, namely bartolosides B, C, and D (2, 5.6 mg; 3, 0.7 mg; and 4, 0.3 mg; Figure 1b), were isolated through bioassay-guided fractionation of a crude extract of Synecho-cystis salina LEGE 06155, a unicellular, free-living cyanobac-terium found at the same beach as the bartoloside A producer.[4] These cyanobacterial strains are morphologically and phylogenetically distant (Figure 1; see also the Support-ing Information, Figure S1). Together with their geographical co-occurrence, this observation may suggest pathway acquis-ition by horizontal gene transfer. Initial structural-elucidation efforts focused on the most abundant metabolites (1 and 2). A combination of 1H, 13C, HSQC, HMBC and COSY data revealed a dialkylresorcinol (DAR) scaffold in both compounds (Supporting Information, S7\u2013S39). d-Xylose and l-rhamnose were O-linked to the aromatic rings in 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 2a, see also Figure S33). The DAR scaffold in 2 was further decorated with a xylose residue C-linked to the C4 position (Figure 2a). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a cyanobacterial C-glycoside. The two alkyl substituents on the resorcinol ring accounted for 25 and 27 carbon atoms in 1 and 2, respectively. Considering the HR-ESI-MS derived molecular formulae Figure 1. The bartolosides are chlorinated aromatic glycolipids found (C36H62Cl2O6 for 1 and C44H76Cl2O10 for 2) and NMR-based partial structures, these groups had to be linear. Overlapping 1H and 13C resonances for the two chlorinated methine groups and their corresponding 2J and 3J HMBC correlations to a total of eight methylene groups placed the Cl atoms on the alkyl chains (Figure 2a) and eliminated the possibility of their vicinal positioning as observed in several naturally occurring marine lipids.[5] The termini of all partial structures showed HMBC and COSY correlations to the methylene envelope, hindering further assignments. Under ESI conditions, the molecules readily fragmented by loss of HCl and the sugar moieties. Alkyl chain fragmentations at higher energy did not allow for inference of the Cl atom or relative alkyl chain positions, but did confirm that C12/C13 chains were present in 1 and C12/C15 chains in 2, 3, and 4 (Supporting Information, S7\u2013S51). Selective irradiation of the benzylic protons in 1D TOCSY experiments revealed that both alkyl chains were chlorinated in 2 (Figure 2b) as they were in 1 (Supporting Information, S7\u2013S9). Owing to our inability to distinguish the two very similar alkyl groups, an assignment of the chain lengths and the determination of the precise Cl atom positions were not possible using NMR spectroscopy and MS alone. To gain additional structural insights, we investigated bartoloside biosynthesis. The DAR scaffold is found in just a few cyanobacterial metabolites: the paracyclophanes,[6] microcarbonin A,[7] and nostocyclyne A (Figure S40).[8] In the biosynthesis of the paracyclophanes, DAR formation involves the type III polyketide synthase (PKS) catalyzed formation of a monoalkylresorcinol followed by an intermo-lecular alkylation reaction.[9] An analogous intramolecular cyclization is conceivable for the biosynthesis of nostocycly-ne A (Figure S40). In other bacteria, a ketosynthase (DarB) and a putative aromatase (DarA) have been shown to synthesize DAR scaffolds in a convergent process.[10] DarB catalyzes the head-to-head condensation of a b-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioester with an a,b-unsaturated acyl ACP thioester, resulting in a dialkylcyclohexanedione car-boxylic acid (carboxy-CHD).[11] DarA is thought to be an aromatase based on its in vivo activity in a heterologous host,[11] but has not been characterized in vitro. Homologues of darA and darB are contiguous in many prokaryotic genomes, including several cyanobacteria.[11] Owing to the multiple cyanobacterial DAR biosynthetic pathways, we could not be sure which biosynthetic machinery would be involved in bartoloside production. To identify the bartoloside biosynthetic pathway, we sequenced the genome of S. salina LEGE 06155 and searched for all of the known DAR biosynthetic pathways. We identified adjacent darA and darB homologues co-localized with additional genes encoding enzymes with predicted functions consistent with a role in bartoloside biosynthesis, including glycosyltransferases and a putative halogenase (Figure 3, Table S7). We designated this region to be the bartoloside (brt) gene cluster (GenBank: KR059027). In contrast to previously characterized darAB-containing gene clusters,[10\u201312] the brt cluster lacks a designated ACP, suggest-ing the use of a trans-acting ACP or ACP thioesters from fatty acid biosynthesis. The participation of acyl-CoA substrates is unlikely as cyanobacteria, including S. salina LEGE 06155, lack a canonical b-oxidation pathway.[13] Based on the brt cluster architecture, we envisioned that the biosynthesis of 2 could proceed through the BrtD-catalyzed condensation of the 2-octadecenoyl-ACP thioester with the 3-oxo-hexadecanoyl-ACP thioester. Both precursors are derivatives of abundant (C18 and C16) cyanobacterial fatty acids.[14] This reaction would yield carboxy-CHD 5, which could spontaneously decarboxylate to give dione 6 or undergo BrtC-catalyzed oxidative aromatization to give the DAR backbone of 2\u20134 (7), which contains C12 and C15 chains at the C2 and C5 positions, respectively (Figure 3b). Alternatively, a DAR scaffold in which the positions of these substituents Figure 2. NMR-derived structural information for 2. a) Fragments are reversed could result from condensation of 2-pentadece-noyl-ACP with 3-oxo-nonadecanoyl-ACP (Figure S36). This scenario is highly unlikely given that C15 and C19 fatty acids are not produced by cyanobacteria.[14] Therefore, both the logic of bartoloside biosynthesis and the availability of biosynthetic precursors constrain the DAR scaffold of 2\u20134. A similar analysis revealed that the assembly of 1 should utilize two C16 fatty acyl ACP derivatives, leading to a DAR with C12 and C13 substituents at the C2 and C5 positions. After DAR formation, the brt-encoded glycosyltransfer-ases should decorate the resorcinol ring with xylose and rhamnose. Chlorine installation presumably requires halo-genation at unactivated carbon atoms, a transformation typically performed by a-ketoglutarate-dependent non-heme iron halogenases.[15] However, this type of enzyme was not found in the S. salina genome. Instead, we predict that BrtJ is the halogenase based on its homology to CylC[9a] and ColD/ColE[16] (41 % identity, 55\u201359% similarity), enzymes encoded in the biosynthetic gene clusters of the halogenated cyanobacterial natural products cylindrocyclophane and columbamide.[16\u201317] BrtJ and its homologues do not resemble known halogenases and therefore likely represent a new enzyme class capable of halogenating unactivated carbon centers. Given their weak homology to the N-oxygenase AurF (BrtJ: 15% identity, 26 % similarity, HHPred E-value:[18] 2.4 \u00d7 10\u00a229), these enzymes may be diiron halogenases,[19] and this possibility will be the subject of future investigations. To confirm the involvement of the brt gene cluster in bartoloside biosynthesis, BrtD and BrtC were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified. According to HR-MS analysis, BrtC bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN; Fig-ure S37). N-Acetylcysteamine (SNAC) thioester analogues of the predicted BrtD substrates (8 and 9) were synthesized and incubated with BrtD; both 5 and 6 were detected in the assay mixture by LC-HR-ESI-MS, which is in agreement with our biosynthetic hypothesis (Figure 4). When BrtC was included in the assay, DAR 7 was observed (Figure 4). These findings provide the first biochemical evidence that DarA homologues are aromatases. Furthermore, the in vivo production of DAR-like metabolites by E. coli transformed with brtCD was observed (Supporting Information, S63, Figure S38). Overall, these observations confirmed the ability of BrtD and BrtC to utilize C16 and C18 fatty acyl thioesters for DAR synthesis and provided experimental verification of the biosynthetic hypothesis that enabled structure elucidation. The only remaining unknown variable in the planar structure of 2 was the position of the Cl atoms. At this point, the acquisition of HSQC-TOCSY data for 2 established the connection of the benzylic moiety in the C15 chain to the chlorinated methine group by identification of four bridging methylene groups (Figure 5a\u2013c; Supporting Information, S20\u2013S39). The w-7 position of the Cl atom in the C12 chain was similarly elucidated by the identification of a previously unassigned bridging methylene group in conjunction with a diagnostic HMBC correlation from the deshielded w-6 methylene protons to the w-3 carbon atom (Figure 5a, d,e; Supporting Information, S20\u2013S39), thus finalizing the struc-ture of 2. Our proposed structure for 1 is based on NMR data highly similar to that of 2 (Supporting Information, S7\u2013S19, Figure S2). The overall structures of 3 and 4 were deduced by comparison of their NMR and HRMS data with those of 2 (Supporting Information, S40\u2013S51). A future challenge lies in establishing the absolute configuration of these glycolipids, which were not amenable to crystallization. The precise positioning of the Cl atoms in the bartolo-sides, cylindrocyclophanes, and columbamides suggests that halogenation by BrtJ homologues is highly specific. Aside from the occurrence of this halogenation in cyanobacterial DARs of distinct biosynthetic origin, the similarity of the 5-alkynyl moieties in microcarbonin A and nostocyclyne A is noteworthy (Figure S40). Together, these observations illus-trate the functional convergence of two distinct biosynthetic logics and could suggest a highly selected role for DARs in cyanobacteria. Recognizing that microcarbonin A was iso-lated on the basis of a strong photosynthesis-inhibiting activity,[7] and that DevBCA export machinery is encoded in the brt cluster, we envisioned that the bartolosides could act as allelochemicals.[2] Compound 2 was indeed a major organic component in S. salina LEGE 06155 culture supernatants (Figure S39). However, we did not observe strong bioactivity in anticyanobacterial, antialgal, or cytotoxicity assays (Sup-porting Information, S54\u2013S55). Furthermore, although DARs are implicated in quorum-sensing,[20] we were unable to locate homologues of the required components of the signaling Figure 4. BrtD and BrtC synthesize the DAR core of bartoloside B. system PauR or LuxR in the genome of S. salina LEGE 06155. In conclusion, the bartolosides are secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacterial genera from which few (Syne-chocystis)[21] or no (Nodosilinea) natural products are known. The chlorinated alkyl substituents of these molecules pre-sented a substantial challenge for structure elucidation. By investigating the biosynthesis of the bartolosides prior to completing the structural assignment, we obtained crucial information that ultimately enabled us to solve the complete planar structures and majority of the stereocenters. Given the increasing accessibility of genomic data, we envision that this general strategy will be a powerful adjunct for structure elucidation. Efforts to study the unusual biosynthetic events in this pathway and the natural roles of the bartolosides are underway. Acknowledgements We thank CEMUP for NMR and MS analyses, A. Fenner, E.

Given their weak homology to the N-oxygenase AurF (BrtJ: 15% identity, 26 % similarity, HHPred E-value:[18] 2.4 \u00d7 10\u00a229), these enzymes may be diiron halogenases,[19] and this possibility will be the subject of future investigations.",
        "To confirm the involvement of the brt gene cluster in bartoloside biosynthesis, BrtD and BrtC were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified. According to HR-MS analysis, BrtC bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN; Fig-ure S37). N-Acetylcysteamine (SNAC) thioester analogues of the predicted BrtD substrates (8 and 9) were synthesized and incubated with BrtD; both 5 and 6 were detected in the assay mixture by LC-HR-ESI-MS, which is in agreement with our biosynthetic hypothesis (Figure 4). When BrtC was included in the assay, DAR 7 was observed (Figure 4). These findings provide the first biochemical evidence that DarA homologues are aromatases. Furthermore, the in vivo production of DAR-like metabolites by E. coli transformed with brtCD was observed (Supporting Information, S63, Figure S38). Overall, these observations confirmed the ability of BrtD and BrtC to utilize C16 and C18 fatty acyl thioesters for DAR synthesis and provided experimental verification of the biosynthetic hypothesis that enabled structure elucidation.",
        "The only remaining unknown variable in the planar structure of 2 was the position of the Cl atoms. At this point, the acquisition of HSQC-TOCSY data for 2 established the connection of the benzylic moiety in the C15 chain to the chlorinated methine group by identification of four bridging methylene groups (Figure 5a\u2013c; Supporting Information, S20\u2013S39). The w-7 position of the Cl atom in the C12 chain was similarly elucidated by the identification of a previously unassigned bridging methylene group in conjunction with a diagnostic HMBC correlation from the deshielded w-6 methylene protons to the w-3 carbon atom (Figure 5a, d,e; Supporting Information, S20\u2013S39), thus finalizing the struc-ture of 2. Our proposed structure for 1 is based on NMR data highly similar to that of 2 (Supporting Information, S7\u2013S19, Figure S2). The overall structures of 3 and 4 were deduced by comparison of their NMR and HRMS data with those of 2 (Supporting Information, S40\u2013S51). A future challenge lies in establishing the absolute configuration of these glycolipids, which were not amenable to crystallization.",
        "The precise positioning of the Cl atoms in the bartolo-sides, cylindrocyclophanes, and columbamides suggests that halogenation by BrtJ homologues is highly specific. Aside from the occurrence of this halogenation in cyanobacterial DARs of distinct biosynthetic origin, the similarity of the 5-alkynyl moieties in microcarbonin A and nostocyclyne A is noteworthy (Figure S40). Together, these observations illus-trate the functional convergence of two distinct biosynthetic logics and could suggest a highly selected role for DARs in cyanobacteria. Recognizing that microcarbonin A was iso-lated on the basis of a strong photosynthesis-inhibiting activity,[7] and that DevBCA export machinery is encoded in the brt cluster, we envisioned that the bartolosides could act as allelochemicals.[2] Compound 2 was indeed a major organic component in S. salina LEGE 06155 culture supernatants (Figure S39). However, we did not observe strong bioactivity in anticyanobacterial, antialgal, or cytotoxicity assays (Sup-porting Information, S54\u2013S55). Furthermore, although DARs are implicated in quorum-sensing,[20] we were unable to locate homologues of the required components of the signaling",

        "In conclusion, the bartolosides are secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacterial genera from which few (Syne-chocystis)[21] or no (Nodosilinea) natural products are known. The chlorinated alkyl substituents of these molecules pre-sented a substantial challenge for structure elucidation. By investigating the biosynthesis of the bartolosides prior to completing the structural assignment, we obtained crucial information that ultimately enabled us to solve the complete planar structures and majority of the stereocenters. Given the increasing accessibility of genomic data, we envision that this general strategy will be a powerful adjunct for structure elucidation. Efforts to study the unusual biosynthetic events in this pathway and the natural roles of the bartolosides are underway.",
