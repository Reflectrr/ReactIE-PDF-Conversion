The protein sequence (SwissProt entry code P81701) of V-BPO was established by combining results from protein and DNA sequencing, and electron density interpretation. The enzyme has nearly an all-helical structure, with two four-helix bundles and only three small b-sheets. The holoenzyme contains trigonal-bipyramidal coordi-nated vanadium atoms at its two active centres. Structural similarity to the only other structurally characterized vanadium-dependent chloroper-oxidase (V-CPO) from Curvularia inaequalis exists in the vicinity of the active site and to a lesser extent in the central four-helix bundle. Despite the low sequence and structural similarity between V-BPO and V-CPO, the vanadium binding centres are highly conserved on the N-terminal side of an a-helix and include the proposed catalytic histidine residue (His418V-BPO/His404V-CPO). The V-BPO structure contains, in addition, a second histidine near the active site (His411V-BPO), which can alter the redox potential of the catalytically active VO2-O2 species by pro-tonation/deprotonation reactions. Speci\u00aec binding sites for the organic substrates, like indoles and monochlordimedone, or for halide ions are not visible in the V-BPO structure. A reaction mechanism for the enzy-matic oxidation of halides is discussed, based on the present structural, spectroscopic and biochemical knowledge of vanadium-dependent halo-peroxidases, explaining the observed enzymatic differences between both enzymes. # 1999 Academic Press Keywords: vanadium; bromoperoxidase; chloroperoxidase; X-ray structure; sequence determination *Corresponding author ing author: pg.de aiener Stra\u00fbe 16, D-54292 Trier, Germany; D.

As a subgroup of peroxidases with broader speci\u00aecity, like horseradish peroxi-dase, they are grouped according to their prosthe-tic co-factor into heme-containing and non-heme-containing enzymes, which are further subdivided in metal-free and vanadium-dependent haloperoxi-dases. Haloperoxidases are of broad interest in industrial catalysis for their ability to catalyse the halogenation of organic compounds. The use of heme-containing enzymes in this application has the disadvantage of low substrate speci\u00aecity and unsatisfactory stability due to rapid oxidation and cleavage of the prosthetic heme ligand. The detec-tion of non-heme-containing peroxidases, especially those containing vanadium (V) (Vilter, 1995), therefore seemed very promising for techni-cal applications. Vanadium-dependent peroxidases, \u00aerst detected in the brown alga Ascophyllum nodo-sum (Vilter, 1984) are very common in brown algae, but are known also from red algae, fungi and lichen. The vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases exclu-sively catalyse the oxidation of halides, organic substrates are halogenated or oxidized sub-sequently due to the formation of hypo-halides. For technical applications, the high stability of these enzymes, their substrate speci\u00aecity and avail-ability from large-scale processes (Vilter, 1994) or expression systems (Simons et al., 1995) is of inter-est. With respect to the structure and reaction mechanism of the vanadium-dependent haloperox-idases, intensive studies using several spectro-scopic methods (for references, see Vilter, 1995) yielded only limited information. Therefore, three different vanadium-dependent peroxidases have been crystallized (Mu\u00c8 ller-Fahrnow et al., 1988; Rush et al., 1995; Weyand et al., 1996; Messerschmidt & Wever, 1996; Brindley et al., 1998) and the \u00aerst structure of a vanadium-depen-dent haloperoxidase, the chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis, solved by Messerschmidt & Wever (1996), provided structural insights into the enzymatic oxidation of halides. The X-ray structure determination of the vanadium-dependent bromo-peroxidase V-BPO from Ascophyllum nodosum, described here, allows the discussion of the observed differences in substrate speci\u00aecity based on a comparison of both HPO sequences and struc-tures, and based on a common reaction mechanism for vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases. Results and Discussion Establishment of the complete sequence The brown alga A. nodosum contains more than one isoenzyme of V-BPO (Vilter 1983b; Krenn et al., 1989; Vilter, 1995). Isolation of high-quality RNA from A. nodosum proved to be dif\u00aecult due to the high content of alginates, fucan sulphates and tan-nins. Therefore, it was not possible to obtain full-length DNA clones (Vilter, 1995). DNA sequencing yielded partial sequences of several isoenzymes that were compared to peptide sequences. Due to the N-terminal blocked sequence and the lack of a corresponding DNA clone, the sequence for the N-terminal \u00aerst 14 residues was established from the X-ray density. The molecular mass calculated on the basis of this sequence is 120,513 Da for the V-BPO homo-dimer, which is in the error range of the reported molecular mass established by mass spectroscopy of 120,413(None200) Da (Vilter, 1995). The present protein sequence is shown in Figure 1. Quality of the structure model The \u00aenal V-BPO-model at the resolution of 2.0 A\u00ca consists of 1111 amino acid residues, two vanadate groups and 1787 water molecules. Three solvent-accessible tyrosine residues (TyrA398, TyrA447 and TyrB447) showed residual electron density in the ortho-position to the hydroxyl group. It is known that several enzymes of the brown alga A. nodosum are iodinated (Ku\u00c8 pper et al., 1998). Therefore, this electron density was interpreted as mono-iodinated tyrosine. In both monomers, Tyr447 shows residual electron density on both sides of the side-chain hydroxyl group (Figure 2). As the sites are not fully occupied, it is not possible to discriminate between a di-iodinated tyrosine residue and two side-chain conformations of a mono-iodinated tyrosine residue. During the re\u00aenement, the occupancies for both iodine atoms were manually varied until a SigmaA weighted mFo \u00ff DFc map showed no residual density. In the \u00aenal model, both atoms have an occupancy of 0.5, which may indicate mono-iodinated tyrosine resi-dues in two different conformations. The occu-pancy for the iodine atom in TyrA398 was manually established as only 0.1. TyrB398, which is buried by a symmetry-related molecule, shows no residual electron density. This lack of iodination of TyrB398 may indicate that iodination of the tyrosine residues occurred after crystallization by soaking of the protein crystals with iodine and hydrogen peroxide. The overall model has a crystallographic R-factor of 16.5 % (Rfree 21.9 %) and shows continuous elec-tron density for all atoms with the exception of some solvent-accessible side-chain atoms on the protein surface and for the pyro-glutamate (see Materials and Methods) at the N terminus of monomer A, which is not included in the \u00aenal model. The RMS deviation for Ca atoms of both monomers is RMSCa \u0088 0.233 and for all protein atoms RMSall \u0088 0.475. The average temperature factors are BaveA \u0088 7.1 A\u00ca 2 and BaveB \u0088 7.0 A\u00ca 2 for protein atoms of monomer B and A, respectively. The vanadate groups have average temperature factors of BaveVO4A \u0088 2.9 A\u00ca 2, BaveVO4B \u0088 4.1 A\u00ca 2 and Figure 1.

See Discussion. 604 Vanadium-dependent Haloperoxidase X-ray Structure certed way by direct attack at the vanadium atom. Anyway, the possibility of replacing the axial oxy-gen atom is demonstrated by the stable V-CPO-VO3-N3 complex, achieved by Messerschmidt & Wever (1996) by soaking V-CPO apoenzyme crys-tals in Na3VO4 solution using sodium azide-con-taining buffers, and most likely the initial step in formation of the vanadium-peroxo complex by hydrogen peroxide is similar. The formation of a vanadium-peroxo complex in the \u00aerst reaction step is found also by steady-state kinetics at pH 6 and pH 7 for both haloperoxidases (de Boer & Wever, 1988; van Schijndel et al., 1994). The V-CPO-O2 structure shows the peroxo group bound side-on (Messerschmidt et al., 1997), consist-ent with the more than 35 structures of small vanadium-(V)-peroxo complexes found in the Cambridge Structure Database (Allen & Kennard, 1993). Therefore, one of the original vanadate oxy-gen atoms has to leave the vanadium coordination sphere as a hydroxyl ion or as water, probably abstracting the second hydrogen peroxide proton (Figure 10(c)). The second peroxide oxygen atom has to be coordinated simultaneously to the vanadium centre, leading to the observed side-on peroxo species. This vanadium-peroxo complex is now able to oxidize the halide ions (Figure 10(d)). The direct coordination of halide ions to the vanadium atom suggested in the proposed reaction mechanism for V-CPO (Messerschmidt et al., 1997), would be in disagreement with the results of 51V and 127I-NMR studies on V-BPO (Vilter et al., 1990; Rehder et al., 1991), which indicate no direct bind-ing to the vanadium atom, at least in the case of iodide. In addition, soaking experiments with both V-BPO substrates, potassium iodide and hydrogen peroxide, provided no indication for an iodinated vanadium species. For these reasons, and assuming a similar reaction mechanism for both vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases in accordance with the highly conserved vanadate binding motif, we suggest a halide ion coordination to the peroxo ligand instead of a direct vanadium coordination (Figure 10(e)). The attack of the halide ion on one of the peroxide oxygen atoms would lead to the cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen peroxide bond and to the formation of an axial vanadium-OHal com-plex (Figure 10(f)), which is corroborated by spec-trophotometric studies for both enzymes (de Boer & Wever, 1988; van Schijndel et al., 1994). The chloroperoxidase activity of V-BPO has been shown to be signi\u00aecantly lower than the activity of V-CPO (Vilter, 1995). This biochemical difference between V-BPO and V-CPO in the oxidation of halide ions (Soedjak & Butler, 1990; van Schijndel et al., 1993; Vilter, 1995) can be attributed to the Figure 11.

Vanadium-dependent Haloperoxidase X-ray Structure 605 second histidine residue, His411V-BPO, which is in close contact to the peroxo-vanadate complex (Figures 9 and 10(d)-(f)). In contrast to V-CPO (and in accordance with our proposed reaction mechanism), this histidine residue can protonate in V-BPO the bound peroxide in the vanadium-peroxo complex and may cleave the peroxide, leading to an inactive VO3-OH species, or could at least alter the redox potential of the peroxo complex in such a way that the oxidation of chloride ions is no longer ef\u00aecient. For V-BPO and the bromoperoxidase from Coral-lina pilulifera, the halogenation of organic indole compounds without intermediate formation of hypohalides (Tschirret-Guth & Butler, 1994) and the enantioselective sulphoxidation of aromatic substituted sulphide derivates (ten Brink et al., 1998) has been reported in addition to the oxidation of halides. With the V-CPO enzyme, in contrast, the sulphoxidation is not enantioselective (ten Brink et al., 1998). The reason for these different reactions is still unclear but may be the consequence of reasonably speci\u00aec binding of these substrates on the hydrophobic surface near the vanadate-binding centre and/or of the different reactivity due to the second histidine residue, His411V-BPO, in the active centre. Sequences of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases Several other vanadium-dependent haloperoxi-dase sequences of eukaryotic organisms have been found and a sequence alignment with the GCG software (Version 9.0) (Genetic Computer Group, 1996) indicates two distinct sequence classes, each including the sequence of one of the presently known V-HPO structures. The V-CPO sequence, on one side, shares high sequence similarities of 97.5 % and 70.2 % to the sequence from the fungus Embellisia didymospora (Barnett et al., 1998) and to the sequence fragment from the fungus Drechslera biseptata (Hemrika et al., 1997) (alignment not shown). The sequence of V-BPO, on the other side, shares sequence similarities of 40.9 % and 42.5 % to sequences of two bromoperoxidases from C. piluli-fera (Shimonishi et al., 1998) and the high sequence similarity of 89.2 % to the sequence of a bromoper-oxidase from Fucus distichus (Vreeland et al., 1998). The sequence alignment for this class of V-BPOs is shown in Figure 11, indicating the conserved vana-date-binding residues, which are found also in sequences of the V-CPO structure class. Interest-ingly, all enzymes of the V-BPO class are classi\u00aeed as bromoperoxidases and show the additional Figure 12. The N terminus of V-BPO monomer B: model of the pyroglutamate in the \u00aenal SigmaA weighted 2mFo \u00ff DFc electron density. The Figure was prepared with O (Jones et al., 1991). 606 Vanadium-dependent Haloperoxidase X-ray Structure second histidine residue near the active site, indi-cating the importance of this residue for substrate speci\u00aecity (Figure 11). Furthermore the quite high sequence similarity within both sequence classes is good evidence for high structural similarity to one of the known V-BPO structures. In the case of the bromoperoxidase from F. distichus even all cysteine residues, which are involved in disulphide bridges in the V-BPO structure, are conserved (Figure 12) and the structure of this bromoperoxidase there-fore should be highly similar to the V-BPO struc-ture. The vanadate-binding sequence motif, general-ized to KX6RPX10-52 (A/S/G) (Y/F) PSGH (T/A) X30-53 (S/G) RX5 H (W/Y/F/H) XXDX3G, has been found also in bacterial acid phosphatases (Hemrika et al., 1997; Neuwald, 1997), mammalian glucose-6-phosphatases and several lipid phosphatases (Stukey & Carman, 1997). For V-CPO, very low phosphatase-activity has been reported (Hemrika et al., 1997) and for V-BPO it is known that treat-ment of apoenzyme with phosphate buffers inhi-bits the haloperoxidase activity (Vilter, 1995). This sequence motif seems to be a common binding motif for threefold negatively charged tetrahedral ions adapted for at least two different activities. Materials and Methods DNA sequencing Algal material, isolation of poly(A)\u0087 mRNA and construction of a cDNA library Ascophyllum nodosum was collected on the Atlantic coast (Roscoff, France). Poly(A)\u0087 RNA were puri\u00aeed from total RNA by hybridization of the 30 poly(A) region of the mRNA to a biotinylated oligo(dT) primer and cap-ture of the hybrid with streptavidin coupled to paramag-netic particles, according to the Promega protocol (Poly ATtract mRNA Isolation System). cDNA was syn-thesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia, stan-dard protocol) and cloned into the EcoRI site of the lambda vector NM1149 (Murray, 1983). The resulting phage DNA was packaged in vitro into phages particles using Gigapack II packaging extract from Stratagene. Isolation and sequencing of cDNA clones The cDNA library from A. nodosum was screened with end-labelled, eightfold degenerate 14-mer and 64-fold degenerate 17-mer oligodesoxynucleotides encoding the amino acid motif FMQYG and HYRFDG, respectively. Hybridizations were performed at 27 NoneC overnight in 6 None SSPE, 0.08 % (w/v) PVP, 0.08 % (v/v) Ficoll, 0.1 % (w/v) SDS and the labelled oligonucleotide. Filters were washed twice at 27 NoneC in the same buffer without radio-active probe. cDNA insertions obtained from the puri\u00aeed lambda phage were subcloned into the EcoRI of pBlue-script-SK. The sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain reaction termination method (Pharmacia) on double-stranded DNA using universal pSK or gene-speci\u00aec primers. Peptide sequencing: chemical and enzymatic cleavages Chemicals CNBr and iodoacetamide were purchased from Merck; trypsin, endoproteinase Lys-C and endoprotei-nase Glu-C were from Boehringer Mannheim; DTT and ammonium bicarbonate were from Sigma; tri\u00afuoroacetic acid (TFA) and urea were from Fluka. All reagents used for protein sequencing and amino acid analysis were from Applied Biosystems. Cyanogen bromide cleavage V-BPO (100 mg) was dissolved in 100 ml of 70 % (v/v) formic acid containing 7 mg of CNBr and incubated for 24 hours at room temperature in the dark under nitrogen (Gross & Witkop, 1961). After dilution with 1 ml of water, the sample was dried in a Speedvac. The peptide fragments were dissolved in 50 % (v/v) acetonitrile con-taining 0.1 % TFA and separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column (4.6 mm None 150 mm) with a gradi-Vanadium-dependent Haloperoxidase X-ray Structure 607 ent from 5 % to 95 % acetonitrile containing 0.1 % TFA in 45 minutes at a \u00afow-rate of 0.8 ml/minute. Cleavage with trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and endoproteinase Lys-C V-BPO (100 mg) was dissolved in 50 ml of 8 M urea, 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate and reduced with 5 ml of 45 mM DTT at 50 NoneC for 15 minutes (Stone & Williams, 1993). Cysteine residues were alkylated by the addition of 5 ml of 100 mM iodoacetamide and incubation at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes. After dilution with 140 ml of water, 2 mg of trypsin and 5 mg of endoproteinase Glu-C or 1 mg of endoproteinase Lys-C were added and incubated for 24 hours at 37 NoneC (trypsin and Lys-C) or room temperature (Glu-C). Peptides were separated on a Vydac C18 column (4.6 mm None 150 mm) or an Aquapore OD-300 C18 column (1.0 mm None 100 mm). Sequence analysis Peptides were collected in microcentrifuge vials, dried in a Speedvac, redissolved in 50 % acetonitrile and applied to Biobrene-treated, precycled glass-\u00aebre \u00aelters and sequenced by automated Edman degradation with Applied Biosystems 470A and 494A Procise (gas-phase) or 473A (pulsed-liquid) sequencers with on-line HPLC detection of PTH amino acids. Mass spectrometry Mass spectra of peptides were measured on a Finni-gan TSQ700 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source. For LC/MS, an Applied Biosystems 172A microbore HPLC with an Aquapore OD-300 C18 column (1.0 mm None 100 mm) was operated at a \u00afow-rate of 40 ml/minute with a gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.06 % TFA in water. The m/z range from 350 to 2000 was continuously scanned in three seconds. Amino acid analysis The amino acid composition of V-BPO and peptide fragments was analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 420A/H analyser by automated gas-phase hydrolysis with 6 M HCl at 160 NoneC for 75 minutes and precolumn derivatization with PITC. Crystallization and crystallographic data collection V-BPO was puri\u00aeed from native cell-material in a large-scale process, consisting of a three-step liquid-liquid extraction, dialysis and hydrophobic interaction and anion-exchange chromatography Vilter (1994). Apoenzyme was prepared by dialysis of holoenzyme according to Vilter 1984. Crystals of the holoenzyme and the apoenzyme were obtained from 2.1 M ammonium sulfate solutions buffered at pH 8.3 and diffracted to 2.4 A\u00ca (1 A\u00ca \u0088 0.1 nm) resolution (Weyand et al., 1996). The crystals were stable in the X-ray beam for more than one week. They belong to the tetragonal system, space group P43212, with lattice constants a \u0088 114.3 A\u00ca , c \u0088 276.0 A\u00ca . The choice of the space group was later con-\u00aermed by visual inspection of the \u00aerst interpretable elec-tron density map, which showed the correct hand for several well-de\u00aened a-helices. The asymmetric unit con-tains one homo-dimer of 556 residues and one vanadate group per monomer with a solvent content, calculated according to Matthews (1968), of 67 % (v/v). The structure solution was performed by isomorphic replacement using tungstate as heavy-atom derivative. It was assumed that the tungstate moiety binds at the same site as the vanadate moiety in the holoenzyme, which was proved by Messerschmidt & Wever (1998) in the case of V-CPO and we found an equivalent result for V-BPO. Data sets of holoenzyme (NATIVE I), apoenzyme (APO) and a tungsten derivative (WO4 I) were collected using a Xentronics area detector and graphite monochro-mated CuKa radiation of a Siemens rotating anode oper-ated at 45 kV and 100 mA (Table 4). All data sets were collected on a Siemens four-axis goniometer with a crys-tal-to-detector distance of 280 mm and a 0.3 mm collima-tor. Crystals were mounted with the c-axis parallel with the oscillation axis. The data sets were measured at three settings, two high-resolution (2None \u0088 22 None) settings and one low-resolution setting (None \u0088 12 None) at constant None angle. High-resolution settings were separated by a 30 None rotation in the w angle. The data for each setting are com-posed of 300 frames with a frame width of ten minutes arc. The exposure time for a frame was 12 minutes (15 minutes for the tungsten derivative) for high-resolution data and ten minutes for low-resolution data. All measurements were carried out at 283 K. The frames were processed using the XENGEN program system (Howard, 1990) and scaled in batches of 4 None rotation using the CCP4 program system (CCP4, 1994). An additional high-resolution native dataset (Native III) was collected at 130 K (Table 4). Crystals of the native holoenzyme were soaked for 24 hours in cryo buf-fer containing 25 % (v/v) glycerol, 2.2 M (NH2)2SO4, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and the two substrates, 10 mM H2O2 and 10 mM KI. Crystals were mounted on a cryo-loop and shock-frozen in a stream of evaporating liquid nitrogen. The X-ray intensities were processed with CER-IUS/XGEN (Biosym/MSI, 1996) and programs from the CCP4 program suite (CCP4, 1994). Crystal parameters and data collection statistics are given in Table 5. Further data sets of the holoenzyme (Native II) and the tungsten derivative (WO4 II) were collected at the beam-line BW6 of the DESY synchrotron using monochroma-tized radiation at l \u0088 1.0 A\u00ca , a k-goniometer and an MAR imaging plate detector (Table 5). The crystal-to-detector distance was 430 mm for the native and 370 mm for the derivative data collection. The scan angle was 1.0 None for all measurements. The data were processed with DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996) and scaled with SCALE-PACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996). Because of strong spot overlapping, only re\u00afections to 2.9 A\u00ca were used. Table 4 gives a summary of data collection, processing, and scaling statistics of the \u00aenally used data sets. Heavy-atom refinement and phasing The structure factor amplitudes of the tungsten derivative were scaled to the native data by the program FHSCAL (CCP4, 1994). The positional parameters of the tungsten-binding site were obtained from a difference Patterson map calculated with FFT (CCP4, 1994). This map was analysed by the program RSPS (CCP4, 1994). Heavy-atom sites were re\u00aened by the vector-space re\u00aenement program VECREF (CCP4, 1994) and phase sets were calculated by the program MLPHARE (CCP4, 1994). Table 4.

        "The homo-dimeric structure of a vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (V-BPO) from the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum (EC 1.1.11.X) has been solved by single isomorphous replacement anomalous scattering (SIRAS) X-ray crystallography at 2.0 A\u00ca resolution (PDB accession code 1QI9), using two heavy-atom datasets of a tungstate derivative measured at two different wavelengths. The protein sequence (SwissProt entry code P81701) of V-BPO was established by combining results from protein and DNA sequencing, and electron density interpretation. The enzyme has nearly an all-helical structure, with two four-helix bundles and only three small b-sheets. The holoenzyme contains trigonal-bipyramidal coordi-nated vanadium atoms at its two active centres. Structural similarity to the only other structurally characterized vanadium-dependent chloroper-oxidase (V-CPO) from Curvularia inaequalis exists in the vicinity of the active site and to a lesser extent in the central four-helix bundle. Despite the low sequence and structural similarity between V-BPO and V-CPO, the vanadium binding centres are highly conserved on the N-terminal side of an a-helix and include the proposed catalytic histidine residue (His418V-BPO/His404V-CPO). The V-BPO structure contains, in addition, a second histidine near the active site (His411V-BPO), which can alter the redox potential of the catalytically active VO2-O2 species by pro-tonation/deprotonation reactions. Speci\u00aec binding sites for the organic substrates, like indoles and monochlordimedone, or for halide ions are not visible in the V-BPO structure. A reaction mechanism for the enzy-matic oxidation of halides is discussed, based on the present structural, spectroscopic and biochemical knowledge of vanadium-dependent halo-peroxidases, explaining the observed enzymatic differences between both enzymes.",

        "Introduction",
        "Haloperoxidases catalyse the oxidation of halides in the presence of peroxides and are referred as iodo-, bromo-or chloroperoxidase according to their ability to oxidize iodide, bro-mide or chloride. As a subgroup of peroxidases with broader speci\u00aecity, like horseradish peroxi-dase, they are grouped according to their prosthe-tic co-factor into heme-containing and non-heme-containing enzymes, which are further subdivided in metal-free and vanadium-dependent haloperoxi-dases. Haloperoxidases are of broad interest in industrial catalysis for their ability to catalyse the halogenation of organic compounds. The use of heme-containing enzymes in this application has the disadvantage of low substrate speci\u00aecity and unsatisfactory stability due to rapid oxidation and cleavage of the prosthetic heme ligand. The detec-tion of non-heme-containing peroxidases, especially those containing vanadium (V) (Vilter, 1995), therefore seemed very promising for techni-cal applications. Vanadium-dependent peroxidases, \u00aerst detected in the brown alga Ascophyllum nodo-sum (Vilter, 1984) are very common in brown algae, but are known also from red algae, fungi and lichen.",
        "The vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases exclu-sively catalyse the oxidation of halides, organic substrates are halogenated or oxidized sub-sequently due to the formation of hypo-halides. For technical applications, the high stability of these enzymes, their substrate speci\u00aecity and avail-ability from large-scale processes (Vilter, 1994) or expression systems (Simons et al., 1995) is of inter-est. With respect to the structure and reaction mechanism of the vanadium-dependent haloperox-idases, intensive studies using several spectro-scopic methods (for references, see Vilter, 1995) yielded only limited information. Therefore, three different vanadium-dependent peroxidases have been crystallized (Mu\u00c8 ller-Fahrnow et al., 1988; Rush et al., 1995; Weyand et al., 1996; Messerschmidt & Wever, 1996; Brindley et al., 1998) and the \u00aerst structure of a vanadium-depen-dent haloperoxidase, the chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis, solved by Messerschmidt & Wever (1996), provided structural insights into the enzymatic oxidation of halides. The X-ray structure determination of the vanadium-dependent bromo-peroxidase V-BPO from Ascophyllum nodosum, described here, allows the discussion of the observed differences in substrate speci\u00aecity based on a comparison of both HPO sequences and struc-tures, and based on a common reaction mechanism for vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases.",
        "Results and Discussion",
        "Establishment of the complete sequence",
        "The brown alga A. nodosum contains more than one isoenzyme of V-BPO (Vilter 1983b; Krenn et al., 1989; Vilter, 1995). Isolation of high-quality RNA from A. nodosum proved to be dif\u00aecult due to the high content of alginates, fucan sulphates and tan-nins. Therefore, it was not possible to obtain full-length DNA clones (Vilter, 1995). DNA sequencing yielded partial sequences of several isoenzymes that were compared to peptide sequences. Due to the N-terminal blocked sequence and the lack of a corresponding DNA clone, the sequence for the N-terminal \u00aerst 14 residues was established from the X-ray density. The molecular mass calculated on the basis of this sequence is 120,513 Da for the V-BPO homo-dimer, which is in the error range of the reported molecular mass established by mass spectroscopy of 120,413(None200) Da (Vilter, 1995). The present protein sequence is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Quality of the structure model",
        "The \u00aenal V-BPO-model at the resolution of 2.0 A\u00ca consists of 1111 amino acid residues, two vanadate groups and 1787 water molecules. Three solvent-accessible tyrosine residues (TyrA398, TyrA447 and TyrB447) showed residual electron density in the ortho-position to the hydroxyl group. It is known that several enzymes of the brown alga A. nodosum are iodinated (Ku\u00c8 pper et al., 1998). Therefore, this electron density was interpreted as mono-iodinated tyrosine. In both monomers, Tyr447 shows residual electron density on both sides of the side-chain hydroxyl group (Figure 2). As the sites are not fully occupied, it is not possible to discriminate between a di-iodinated tyrosine residue and two side-chain conformations of a mono-iodinated tyrosine residue. During the re\u00aenement, the occupancies for both iodine atoms were manually varied until a SigmaA weighted mFo \u00ff DFc map showed no residual density. In the \u00aenal model, both atoms have an occupancy of 0.5, which may indicate mono-iodinated tyrosine resi-dues in two different conformations. The occu-pancy for the iodine atom in TyrA398 was manually established as only 0.1. TyrB398, which is buried by a symmetry-related molecule, shows no residual electron density. This lack of iodination of TyrB398 may indicate that iodination of the tyrosine residues occurred after crystallization by soaking of the protein crystals with iodine and hydrogen peroxide.",
        "The overall model has a crystallographic R-factor of 16.5 % (Rfree 21.9 %) and shows continuous elec-tron density for all atoms with the exception of some solvent-accessible side-chain atoms on the protein surface and for the pyro-glutamate (see Materials and Methods) at the N terminus of monomer A, which is not included in the \u00aenal model. The RMS deviation for Ca atoms of both monomers is RMSCa \u0088 0.233 and for all protein atoms RMSall \u0088 0.475. The average temperature factors are BaveA \u0088 7.1 A\u00ca 2 and BaveB \u0088 7.0 A\u00ca 2 for protein atoms of monomer B and A, respectively.

Anyway, the possibility of replacing the axial oxy-gen atom is demonstrated by the stable V-CPO-VO3-N3 complex, achieved by Messerschmidt & Wever (1996) by soaking V-CPO apoenzyme crys-tals in Na3VO4 solution using sodium azide-con-taining buffers, and most likely the initial step in formation of the vanadium-peroxo complex by hydrogen peroxide is similar.",
        "The formation of a vanadium-peroxo complex in the \u00aerst reaction step is found also by steady-state kinetics at pH 6 and pH 7 for both haloperoxidases (de Boer & Wever, 1988; van Schijndel et al., 1994). The V-CPO-O2 structure shows the peroxo group bound side-on (Messerschmidt et al., 1997), consist-ent with the more than 35 structures of small vanadium-(V)-peroxo complexes found in the Cambridge Structure Database (Allen & Kennard, 1993). Therefore, one of the original vanadate oxy-gen atoms has to leave the vanadium coordination sphere as a hydroxyl ion or as water, probably abstracting the second hydrogen peroxide proton (Figure 10(c)). The second peroxide oxygen atom has to be coordinated simultaneously to the vanadium centre, leading to the observed side-on peroxo species. This vanadium-peroxo complex is now able to oxidize the halide ions (Figure 10(d)). The direct coordination of halide ions to the vanadium atom suggested in the proposed reaction mechanism for V-CPO (Messerschmidt et al., 1997), would be in disagreement with the results of 51V and 127I-NMR studies on V-BPO (Vilter et al., 1990; Rehder et al., 1991), which indicate no direct bind-ing to the vanadium atom, at least in the case of iodide. In addition, soaking experiments with both V-BPO substrates, potassium iodide and hydrogen peroxide, provided no indication for an iodinated vanadium species. For these reasons, and assuming a similar reaction mechanism for both vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases in accordance with the highly conserved vanadate binding motif, we suggest a halide ion coordination to the peroxo ligand instead of a direct vanadium coordination (Figure 10(e)). The attack of the halide ion on one of the peroxide oxygen atoms would lead to the cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen peroxide bond and to the formation of an axial vanadium-OHal com-plex (Figure 10(f)), which is corroborated by spec-trophotometric studies for both enzymes (de Boer & Wever, 1988; van Schijndel et al., 1994).",

        "For V-BPO and the bromoperoxidase from Coral-lina pilulifera, the halogenation of organic indole compounds without intermediate formation of hypohalides (Tschirret-Guth & Butler, 1994) and the enantioselective sulphoxidation of aromatic substituted sulphide derivates (ten Brink et al., 1998) has been reported in addition to the oxidation of halides. With the V-CPO enzyme, in contrast, the sulphoxidation is not enantioselective (ten Brink et al., 1998). The reason for these different reactions is still unclear but may be the consequence of reasonably speci\u00aec binding of these substrates on the hydrophobic surface near the vanadate-binding centre and/or of the different reactivity due to the second histidine residue, His411V-BPO, in the active centre. Sequences of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases",
        "Several other vanadium-dependent haloperoxi-dase sequences of eukaryotic organisms have been found and a sequence alignment with the GCG software (Version 9.0) (Genetic Computer Group, 1996) indicates two distinct sequence classes, each including the sequence of one of the presently known V-HPO structures. The V-CPO sequence, on one side, shares high sequence similarities of 97.5 % and 70.2 % to the sequence from the fungus Embellisia didymospora (Barnett et al., 1998) and to the sequence fragment from the fungus Drechslera biseptata (Hemrika et al., 1997) (alignment not shown). The sequence of V-BPO, on the other side, shares sequence similarities of 40.9 % and 42.5 % to sequences of two bromoperoxidases from C. piluli-fera (Shimonishi et al., 1998) and the high sequence similarity of 89.2 % to the sequence of a bromoper-oxidase from Fucus distichus (Vreeland et al., 1998). The sequence alignment for this class of V-BPOs is shown in Figure 11, indicating the conserved vana-date-binding residues, which are found also in sequences of the V-CPO structure class. Interest-ingly, all enzymes of the V-BPO class are classi\u00aeed as bromoperoxidases and show the additional",

Furthermore the quite high sequence similarity within both sequence classes is good evidence for high structural similarity to one of the known V-BPO structures. In the case of the bromoperoxidase from F. distichus even all cysteine residues, which are involved in disulphide bridges in the V-BPO structure, are conserved (Figure 12) and the structure of this bromoperoxidase there-fore should be highly similar to the V-BPO struc-ture.",

For V-CPO, very low phosphatase-activity has been reported (Hemrika et al., 1997) and for V-BPO it is known that treat-ment of apoenzyme with phosphate buffers inhi-bits the haloperoxidase activity (Vilter, 1995).

It was assumed that the tungstate moiety binds at the same site as the vanadate moiety in the holoenzyme, which was proved by Messerschmidt & Wever (1998) in the case of V-CPO and we found an equivalent result for V-BPO. Data sets of holoenzyme (NATIVE I), apoenzyme (APO) and a tungsten derivative (WO4 I) were collected using a Xentronics area detector and graphite monochro-mated CuKa radiation of a Siemens rotating anode oper-ated at 45 kV and 100 mA (Table 4).

High-resolution settings were separated by a 30 None rotation in the w angle. The data for each setting are com-posed of 300 frames with a frame width of ten minutes arc. The exposure time for a frame was 12 minutes (15 minutes for the tungsten derivative) for high-resolution data and ten minutes for low-resolution data. All measurements were carried out at 283 K.
