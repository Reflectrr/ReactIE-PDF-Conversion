In polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymatic pathways, the substrate is attached to a carrier protein (CP) while the tailoring enzymes make modifications to yield a final product. The CP may therefore have a role in determining what enzymes act on the substrate, influencing the final product\u2019s chemistry. In this study, pyrrole halogenases from several different bacterial species were characterized in vitro to test their ability to halogenate pyrrolyl CPs from four different natural product biosynthetic pathways. The reactions were analyzed via mass spectrometry to determine the halogenation state of the products formed. This study concludes that only some halogenases can act promiscuously on CPs from other pathways. Additionally, there is some modulation in the number of halogenation events between certain CP and halogenase pairs. The selectivity of these halogenase and CP interactions is likely caused by protein-protein interactions, and the structure of the CP/halogenase complex may provide new insights into such interaction.  Introduction  Natural products are small molecule metabolites from biological sources. They are found in all parts of the biosphere and have a diverse range of function in ecosystems. Organisms use these molecules for signaling, for chemical defense, and as allelochemicals (1-3). In addition to their functional diversity, their chemical diversity is pronounced. This has led to their use as drug candidates with action against tumors, inflammation, viruses, and bacteria (4, 5). Detailed understanding of natural product biosynthesis will allow us to more fully understand their natural role, as well as provide a platform for industrial production of complex chemical structures that are otherwise too expensive to be made from a chemical synthesis route (6).  There are some natural product pathways that share remarkably similar enzymatic machinery, including fatty acid synthesis (FAS), polyketide synthesis (PKS), and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS). Each of these pathways takes small molecule building blocks and arranges them in modular structures to form highly complex final products. Through this strategy, organisms can take simple molecules like malonyl-CoA or amino acids and make specialized compounds for any number of purposes. The modular structure is facilitated by an assembly line layout of enzymes, with different enzymes carrying out specific modifications, then passing the growing product onwards. In most currently known pathways of this type, there is a CP that covalently binds the substrate while it is being modified by the other enzymes in the pathway. These CPs interact with the surfaces of other enzymes in a dynamic way, potentially helping to guide the substrate through the biosynthetic pathway (7).  Several similar natural product biosynthetic pathways that utilize the same general enzymology have been well characterized. For one specific motif, the halogenated pyrrole, there are at least four pathways leading to its production (Figure 1). The biosynthesis of pyoluteorin, an antifungal molecule with a chlorinated pyrrole, is encoded by the Plt gene cluster in Pseudomonas fluorescence, a soil bacterium (8). Similarly, the biosynthesis of chlorizidine A and its chlorinated pyrrole procedes by a polyketide synthase gene cluster (9). However, instead of being synthesized by a terrestrial microbe, this set of enzymes comes from the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. CNH-287. Marinopyrrole is also from a marine bacterium (10). In addition to chlorinated pyrrole rings, brominated pyrrole products like tetrabromopyrrole are produced by the marine bacterium Marinomonas mediterranae MMB-1 (11). These examples, shown in Figure 1, show that enzymology for generation of a pyrrole scaffold is 3  widespread in bacteria from a variety of environments, which makes it a natural target for biochemical investigation.  The halogenated pyrrole biosynthesis starts with a free proline molecule (Figure 1). The proline is adenylated by the adenylation domain, using up ATP to attach an AMP moiety in place of the carboxyl group. Then, the adenylation domain attaches the proline to the pantetheine arm of the CP using AMP as the leaving group. This leaves a proline attached to the CP via a thioester bond. The proline is then dehydrogenated at two locations on the ring, generating the pyrrole. After that, the pyrrole ring is halogenated by the halogenase enzyme. The halogenated pyrrole ring is then further modified and incorporated into the final natural product structure, such as chlorizidine A or pyoluteorin.  Since these pathways are well characterized, they can be used to query the selectivity of CPs and halogenases. Using in vitro enzyme assays, this study combined CPs and halogenases across pathways in an attempt to generate halogenated pyrrole products. This experiment will inform on the selectivity of CPs towards their respective halogenases. Additionally, it will provide a new platform for developing cross-pathway natural products with novel chemistries, potentially harnessing pathways from diverse organisms to develop novel therapeutic molecules.  Methods and Materials  Protein Purification  Each of the proteins needed for the enzymatic assay was expressed recombinantly in E. coli using plasmids (Table 1). The halogenase enzymes Bmp2, Clz5, and Mpy16 were expressed to encode for His-MBP tag at their N-terminus using pET-28MBP vector. PltA halogenase was expressed to encode for His-tagged protein using the pET-28b vector. The CPs (Bmp1, PltL, Clz18, and Mpy15) were expressed with His tags using the pET-28b vector. PtdH, a phosphite dehydrogenase used to regenerate NADH cofactor was purified previously for other experiments, and it was used from a stock kept at -80\u00b0C.  Using E. coli cells transformed with the required plasmids, overnight cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C. One-liter cultures of TB liquid media were inoculated and allowed to reach 0.6 OD600 at 37\u00b0C. Recombinant protein expression was induced by 0.3 mM IPTG at 18\u00b0C for 18 hours with vigorous shaking. The culture was then centrifuged to collect the biomass in the pellet, which was resuspended in binding buffer (see Table 2 for all buffer compositions). The resuspended cells were sonicated for 15 minutes with stirring using a 10:50 on:off cycle, lysing the cells. After the cells were lysed, the solution was centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 40 minutes to obtain supernatant. The supernatant was loaded onto a Nickel affinity chromatography column attached to an AKTA Prime FPLC system at 4\u00b0C and washed with 40 mL wash buffer. The protein was eluted with a 40 mL gradient of elution buffer ranging from 0% to 100%. Proteins were then dialyzed using dialysis buffer overnight. After dialysis, the protein solution was loaded onto an anion exchange column. The column was washed and the protein was eluted using IEX buffer B. Finally, the protein was put through a size exclusion PD-10 column for desalting and was eluted with storage buffer.  Synthesis of pyrrolyl-CP substrates  Proteins were stored at -80\u00b0C until they were ready to be used in an assay, at which point they were thawed on ice, vortexed gently, and centrifuged. Pyrrolyl-CP substrates were generated using purified CPs and organically synthesized pyrrolyl-pantetheine substrate. Multiple enzymatic transformations lead 4  to the pyrrolylpantetheine present in the biosynthetic pathway (shown in Figure 2). In this study, however, a pyrrole moiety was synthetically attached to a pantetheine molecule and this was enzymatically ligated to the CP using CoaA, CoaD, CoaE, and Sfp in a single pot reaction (Table 3) following the methods described previously (12). The Coa enzymes are naturally used in E. coli to prepare CP pantetheine groups, but they are promiscuous enough to accept a variety of altered pantetheine derivatives, including the pyrrolylpantetheine. The reaction products were purified on a Superdex 75 16/200 size exclusion chromatography column, equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The purified pyrrolyl-CP substrates were confirmed by LC-MS analysis.  Enzyme assays  The setup for enzyme assays is shown in Table 4. Assays were carried out in 100 \u03bcL reaction volumes held at 30\u00b0C for 3 hours. Each reaction contained 50 \u03bcM pyrrolyl-CP, 20 \u03bcM halogenase, 10 \u03bcM PtdH phosphite dehydrogenase, and 20 \u03bcM RebF flavin reductase, 20 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.9, 200 mM KCl or KBr as a halide source, 1 mM NAD+, 100 \u03bcM FAD, 10 mM sodium phosphite, 5 mM TCEP reducing agent, and final volume adjustment was done with 20% glycerol. Freshly prepared sodium phosphite was used in the reaction. After 3 hours, the reactions were quenched with a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and water. Once quenched, the reactions were centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 minutes, and 20 \u03bcL of supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS.  Within the assay, the sodium phosphite provided the chemical energy for the product formation (Figure 4). The enzyme PTDH transforms phosphite into phosphate, making NADH in the process. This NADH is subsequently consumed by RebF, a flavin reductase, when it turns FAD+ into FADH2. The FADH2 powers the halogenase reaction. The entire enzymatic sequence is regenerated in situ, only consuming phosphite ion, which is provided in excess. The procedure is similar to previously described assays, differing mainly in source of flavin reductase (13).  Analysis of halogenated reaction products  Reaction products were analyzed on an Agilent 1260 infinity quaternary LC coupled to impact II ToF mass spectrometer. Data was acquired in the positive mode between 100 and 2000 m/z. All procedures were identical to those previously described (13). Data was analyzed by MS1 (when available) and MS2. The formula for deconvoluted mass = (ion mass x charge) \u2013 (mass of hydrogen x charge) was used to find the deconvoluted mass of the whole peptide in MS1 (Figure 5A). For MS2 analysis, the phosphopantetheine ejection ion was used to determine halogenated product. The phosphopantetheine with the pyrrolyl substrate attached gives an ejection ion at 354.15 m/z. From that mass, any addition of halogen attachments increases the ejection ion mass to charge ratio (Figure 3). For chlorine, mono-chlorination results in a 388.11 m/z ejection ion, while di-chlorination results in an ejection ion at 422.07 m/z. Additionally, the 422.07 m/z ion exhibits an isotopic envelope effect characteristic of chlorination (Figure 6). For bromination, the ejection ions have exact masses of 432.06 m/z (mono-bromination), 509.97 m/z (di-bromination), and 587.88 m/z (tri-bromination).  Results and Discussion  Synthesis of pyrrolyl-CP substrates  Products of the reaction to generate pyrrolyl-CPs were analyzed with LC-MS. If the pyrrolyl-CP substrate was successfully generated, an ejection ion at 354.15 m/z should be observed. In the absence of the 5  pyrrolyl-pantetheine ejection ion, the predominant MS2 ion is the pantetheine ejection ion at 261.12 m/z corresponding to the holo-CP (Figure 2A). The holo-CP is a result of the E. coli phospantetheinyl transferase attaching a pantetheine moiety to the CP during recombinant protein expression. Only a small fraction of the recombinant CP is transformed into holo-CP. Detection of pantetheine ejection ions of 354.15 m/z and 261.12 m/z from the pyrrolyl-CP synthesis reaction shows successful generation of pyrrolyl-CP substrate (Figure 2B). Only one representative example for Bmp1 (CP) and pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) is shown in Figure 2. Similar results hold true for pyrrolyl-PltL (CP), pyrrolyl-Clz18 (CP), and pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP).  Enzyme assay of CP with halogenase  Assay with Pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) and halogenase When assays were done to test the halogenase activity of Bmp2, PltA, and Mpy16 on pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) substrate, none of the reactions showed evidence of halogenation, based on analysis of the MS1 spectra and the MS2 ejection ions (Figure 7). For the assay with Bmp2, the MS1 analysis of the [M+12H]+12 ion yielded a mass of 11,046 Da, which corresponds to the pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) substrate. The MS2 for the assay with Bmp2 also yielded exclusively ejection ion at 354 m/z, with no ejection ions of 432, 510, or 587 m/z, suggesting no halogenation reaction by Bmp2 (Figure 7A). The result is particularly concerning, as the Bmp1 and Bmp2 combination was meant to serve as a positive control. The reaction\u2019s failure is likely due to Bmp2 having degraded activity during storage. PltA combined with pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) gave a [M+12H]+12 ion with a monoisotopic mass of 921.5539, which corresponds to mass at 11,046 Da. This is the mass for the pyrrolyl-CP, the same as in the Bmp2 assay. When the MS2 spectrum was examined, it also gave no evidence of chlorination as ejection ions for chlorinated pyrrole were not detected and only ejection ions at 354 m/z were observed (Figure 7B). For the assay done with Mpy16 halogenase, pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) showed a similar result as the [M+12H]+12 ion gave a mass of 11,046 Da, corresponding to the pyrrolyl substrate, with no MS2 evidence for halogenation (Figure 7D). The only halogenase that halogenated the pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) substrate was Clz5, which showed a MS2 ejection ion for mono-chlorinated pyrrolyl-CP product (Figure 7C). However, the predominant MS2 ejection ion corresponded to the 354 m/z substrate suggesting low turnover of substrate by Clz5.  Assay with Pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) and halogenase When pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) was used as a substrate with the various halogenases, every halogenase except Bmp2 resulted in a di-chlorinated product (Figure 8). Bmp2 once again showed no evidence of halogenation, with the only MS2 ejection ion 354 m/z (Figure 8A). The MS1 spectrum yielded a deconvoluted mass of 12,547 Da using the [M+15H]+15 ion, corresponding to the pyrrolyl-CP substrate. As expected, the assay with pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) substrate and PltA halogenase produced a di-chlorinated product shown by the MS2 ejection ion at 422 m/z (Figure 8B). The MS1 analysis was not possible due to very noisy data. The MS2 analysis of reaction product of halogenase Clz5 also resulted in 422 m/z ejection ion, showing the di-chlorination of pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) by Clz5 (Figure 8C). Similar to data from the PltA reaction, the MS1 data was too noisy to interpret. Finally, Mpy16 halogenase also showed di-chlorination of pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) as evidenced by the MS2 data showing a strong ejection ion at 422 m/z (Figure 8D).  Assay with Pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) and halogenase For the assay with pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) and halogenase, the activity varied among halogenases (Figure 9). Bmp2 showed no evidence of halogenation, similar to the previous reactions with other CPs. The MS2 spectrum showed a strong peak at 354 m/z but no peak that corresponded to either mono-or di-bromination (Figure 9A). Furthermore, the MS1 data showed a [M+12H]+12 ion that gave a deconvoluted 6  mass of 10,681 Da, which corresponds to the pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) substrate. The halogenase PltA mono-and di-chlorinated the pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) substrate, as evidenced by the presence of 388 m/z and 422 m/z MS2 peaks (Figure 9B). For the MS1 data, the predominant [M+11]+11 ion gave a deconvoluted mass of 10,749 Da, which is 68 Da higher than the pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) observed in the Bmp2 assay. The shift in mass can be explained by the exchange of two hydrogen atoms for two chlorine atoms, which should result in a 67.9 Da shift. This result shows that the predominant reaction product of PltA is di-chlorinated pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP). For Clz5, chlorinated product formation was less pronounced but still present (Figure 9C). The MS1 analysis of the predominant [M+11H]+11 ion gave a deconvoluted mass of 10,681 Da, once again corresponding to the pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) substrate. However, analysis of the MS2 data shows ejection ions of 388 m/z and 354 m/z. This shows that Clz5 mono-chlorinates pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP), but no evidence of di-chlorination was found. Mpy16 assayed with its native CP, pyrrolyl-Mpy15, did chlorinate the substrate, showing evidence of both mono-and di-chlorination. MS1 analysis of the most prominent peak (the [M+11H]+11 ion) gave a deconvoluted mass of 10,715 Da, which is a 34 Da mass change indicative of mono-chlorination. Consistent with this, the highest intensity ion in the MS2 data was the 388 m/z ion along with 422 m/z and 354 m/z, corresponding to di-chlorinated product and pyrrolyl substrates respectively (Figure 9D). This result shows that Mpy16 can both mono-and di-chlorinate its natural substrate.  Conclusion  The results of the enzyme assays clearly show that halogenases can recognize pyrrolyl-CPs from across pathways and halogenate when analyzed by in vitro assays. The assays that showed no evidence of halogenation were mostly those involving Bmp2 as a halogenase, which could be explained by the specific preparation of Bmp2 used having lost its activity. The other assays that did not give evidence for halogenation were PltA with pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) and Mpy16 with pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP). These enzymes in reaction showed chlorination activity, suggesting the observed result is not due to degradation of their activity. The selectivity that these enzymes display on pyrrolyl-CP substrate could be explained by protein-protein interactions between substrate and halogenase pair. It is possible that the CP and the halogenase must be in close proximity for their activity. Thus, there are likely to be motifs on both surfaces that facilitate interaction. The selectivity observed could be due to difference in amino acid residues between CP and halogenase pairs from different pathways. If some of these residues are different from species to species, it could lead to the selectivity that was observed.  One way to understand the protein-protein interaction between the halogenase and CP pairs is to crystallize them in complex and study the structure-function relationship between the two proteins. A similar strategy has recently been employed to determine the complex of a CP and an oxidase enzyme in the tetrabromopyrrole biosynthetic pathway (14). Such a crystal structure would provide a framework for visualizing the differences in amino acid sequence for each CP. In follow up to that, site mutagenesis experiments could be performed to validate information obtained from the structure of the CP and halogenase pairs complex.  This study of CP and halogenase selectivity has potential impacts in the pharmaceutical biosynthesis of halogenated molecules. Oftentimes, pharmaceuticals of interest have complicated chemical syntheses that can make it desirable to pursue a biosynthetic approach. By determining the selectivity of these CPs to related halogenase enzymes, we will be able to mix and match CP and halogenase pairs across pathways to obtain a designer natural product. Additionally, the results show that CPs and halogenases work together across a broad variety of bacterial sources. 7  Figures and Tables    Figure 1: Generalized biosynthetic pathway for halogenated pyrrole biosynthesis, with final products 8      Figure 2: Comparison of MS2 spectrum of Bmp1 (CP) and pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP).

This experiment will inform on the selectivity of CPs towards their respective halogenases. Additionally, it will provide a new platform for developing cross-pathway natural products with novel chemistries, potentially harnessing pathways from diverse organisms to develop novel therapeutic molecules.  Methods and Materials  Protein Purification  Each of the proteins needed for the enzymatic assay was expressed recombinantly in E. coli using plasmids (Table 1). The halogenase enzymes Bmp2, Clz5, and Mpy16 were expressed to encode for His-MBP tag at their N-terminus using pET-28MBP vector. PltA halogenase was expressed to encode for His-tagged protein using the pET-28b vector. The CPs (Bmp1, PltL, Clz18, and Mpy15) were expressed with His tags using the pET-28b vector. PtdH, a phosphite dehydrogenase used to regenerate NADH cofactor was purified previously for other experiments, and it was used from a stock kept at -80\u00b0C.  Using E. coli cells transformed with the required plasmids, overnight cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C. One-liter cultures of TB liquid media were inoculated and allowed to reach 0.6 OD600 at 37\u00b0C. Recombinant protein expression was induced by 0.3 mM IPTG at 18\u00b0C for 18 hours with vigorous shaking. The culture was then centrifuged to collect the biomass in the pellet, which was resuspended in binding buffer (see Table 2 for all buffer compositions). The resuspended cells were sonicated for 15 minutes with stirring using a 10:50 on:off cycle, lysing the cells. After the cells were lysed, the solution was centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 40 minutes to obtain supernatant. The supernatant was loaded onto a Nickel affinity chromatography column attached to an AKTA Prime FPLC system at 4\u00b0C and washed with 40 mL wash buffer. The protein was eluted with a 40 mL gradient of elution buffer ranging from 0% to 100%. Proteins were then dialyzed using dialysis buffer overnight. After dialysis, the protein solution was loaded onto an anion exchange column. The column was washed and the protein was eluted using IEX buffer B. Finally, the protein was put through a size exclusion PD-10 column for desalting and was eluted with storage buffer.  Synthesis of pyrrolyl-CP substrates  Proteins were stored at -80\u00b0C until they were ready to be used in an assay, at which point they were thawed on ice, vortexed gently, and centrifuged. Pyrrolyl-CP substrates were generated using purified CPs and organically synthesized pyrrolyl-pantetheine substrate. Multiple enzymatic transformations lead",

        "to the pyrrolylpantetheine present in the biosynthetic pathway (shown in Figure 2). In this study, however, a pyrrole moiety was synthetically attached to a pantetheine molecule and this was enzymatically ligated to the CP using CoaA, CoaD, CoaE, and Sfp in a single pot reaction (Table 3) following the methods described previously (12). The Coa enzymes are naturally used in E. coli to prepare CP pantetheine groups, but they are promiscuous enough to accept a variety of altered pantetheine derivatives, including the pyrrolylpantetheine. The reaction products were purified on a Superdex 75 16/200 size exclusion chromatography column, equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The purified pyrrolyl-CP substrates were confirmed by LC-MS analysis.  Enzyme assays  The setup for enzyme assays is shown in Table 4. Assays were carried out in 100 \u03bcL reaction volumes held at 30\u00b0C for 3 hours. Each reaction contained 50 \u03bcM pyrrolyl-CP, 20 \u03bcM halogenase, 10 \u03bcM PtdH phosphite dehydrogenase, and 20 \u03bcM RebF flavin reductase, 20 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.9, 200 mM KCl or KBr as a halide source, 1 mM NAD+, 100 \u03bcM FAD, 10 mM sodium phosphite, 5 mM TCEP reducing agent, and final volume adjustment was done with 20% glycerol. Freshly prepared sodium phosphite was used in the reaction. After 3 hours, the reactions were quenched with a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and water. Once quenched, the reactions were centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 minutes, and 20 \u03bcL of supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS.  Within the assay, the sodium phosphite provided the chemical energy for the product formation (Figure 4). The enzyme PTDH transforms phosphite into phosphate, making NADH in the process. This NADH is subsequently consumed by RebF, a flavin reductase, when it turns FAD+ into FADH2. The FADH2 powers the halogenase reaction. The entire enzymatic sequence is regenerated in situ, only consuming phosphite ion, which is provided in excess. The procedure is similar to previously described assays, differing mainly in source of flavin reductase (13).",

        "Analysis of halogenated reaction products  Reaction products were analyzed on an Agilent 1260 infinity quaternary LC coupled to impact II ToF mass spectrometer. Data was acquired in the positive mode between 100 and 2000 m/z. All procedures were identical to those previously described (13). Data was analyzed by MS1 (when available) and MS2. The formula for deconvoluted mass = (ion mass x charge) \u2013 (mass of hydrogen x charge) was used to find the deconvoluted mass of the whole peptide in MS1 (Figure 5A). For MS2 analysis, the phosphopantetheine ejection ion was used to determine halogenated product. The phosphopantetheine with the pyrrolyl substrate attached gives an ejection ion at 354.15 m/z. From that mass, any addition of halogen attachments increases the ejection ion mass to charge ratio (Figure 3). For chlorine, mono-chlorination results in a 388.11 m/z ejection ion, while di-chlorination results in an ejection ion at 422.07 m/z. Additionally, the 422.07 m/z ion exhibits an isotopic envelope effect characteristic of chlorination (Figure 6). For bromination, the ejection ions have exact masses of 432.06 m/z (mono-bromination), 509.97 m/z (di-bromination), and 587.88 m/z (tri-bromination).  Results and Discussion  Synthesis of pyrrolyl-CP substrates  Products of the reaction to generate pyrrolyl-CPs were analyzed with LC-MS. If the pyrrolyl-CP substrate was successfully generated, an ejection ion at 354.15 m/z should be observed. In the absence of the",

        "pyrrolyl-pantetheine ejection ion, the predominant MS2 ion is the pantetheine ejection ion at 261.12 m/z corresponding to the holo-CP (Figure 2A). The holo-CP is a result of the E. coli phospantetheinyl transferase attaching a pantetheine moiety to the CP during recombinant protein expression. Only a small fraction of the recombinant CP is transformed into holo-CP. Detection of pantetheine ejection ions of 354.15 m/z and 261.12 m/z from the pyrrolyl-CP synthesis reaction shows successful generation of pyrrolyl-CP substrate (Figure 2B). Only one representative example for Bmp1 (CP) and pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) is shown in Figure 2. Similar results hold true for pyrrolyl-PltL (CP), pyrrolyl-Clz18 (CP), and pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP).  Enzyme assay of CP with halogenase  Assay with Pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) and halogenase When assays were done to test the halogenase activity of Bmp2, PltA, and Mpy16 on pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) substrate, none of the reactions showed evidence of halogenation, based on analysis of the MS1 spectra and the MS2 ejection ions (Figure 7). For the assay with Bmp2, the MS1 analysis of the [M+12H]+12 ion yielded a mass of 11,046 Da, which corresponds to the pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) substrate. The MS2 for the assay with Bmp2 also yielded exclusively ejection ion at 354 m/z, with no ejection ions of 432, 510, or 587 m/z, suggesting no halogenation reaction by Bmp2 (Figure 7A). The result is particularly concerning, as the Bmp1 and Bmp2 combination was meant to serve as a positive control. The reaction\u2019s failure is likely due to Bmp2 having degraded activity during storage. PltA combined with pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) gave a [M+12H]+12 ion with a monoisotopic mass of 921.5539, which corresponds to mass at 11,046 Da. This is the mass for the pyrrolyl-CP, the same as in the Bmp2 assay. When the MS2 spectrum was examined, it also gave no evidence of chlorination as ejection ions for chlorinated pyrrole were not detected and only ejection ions at 354 m/z were observed (Figure 7B). For the assay done with Mpy16 halogenase, pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) showed a similar result as the [M+12H]+12 ion gave a mass of 11,046 Da, corresponding to the pyrrolyl substrate, with no MS2 evidence for halogenation (Figure 7D). The only halogenase that halogenated the pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) substrate was Clz5, which showed a MS2 ejection ion for mono-chlorinated pyrrolyl-CP product (Figure 7C). However, the predominant MS2 ejection ion corresponded to the 354 m/z substrate suggesting low turnover of substrate by Clz5.  Assay with Pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) and halogenase When pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) was used as a substrate with the various halogenases, every halogenase except Bmp2 resulted in a di-chlorinated product (Figure 8). Bmp2 once again showed no evidence of halogenation, with the only MS2 ejection ion 354 m/z (Figure 8A). The MS1 spectrum yielded a deconvoluted mass of 12,547 Da using the [M+15H]+15 ion, corresponding to the pyrrolyl-CP substrate. As expected, the assay with pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) substrate and PltA halogenase produced a di-chlorinated product shown by the MS2 ejection ion at 422 m/z (Figure 8B). The MS1 analysis was not possible due to very noisy data. The MS2 analysis of reaction product of halogenase Clz5 also resulted in 422 m/z ejection ion, showing the di-chlorination of pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) by Clz5 (Figure 8C). Similar to data from the PltA reaction, the MS1 data was too noisy to interpret. Finally, Mpy16 halogenase also showed di-chlorination of pyrrolyl-PltL (CP) as evidenced by the MS2 data showing a strong ejection ion at 422 m/z (Figure 8D).  Assay with Pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) and halogenase For the assay with pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) and halogenase, the activity varied among halogenases (Figure 9). Bmp2 showed no evidence of halogenation, similar to the previous reactions with other CPs. The MS2 spectrum showed a strong peak at 354 m/z but no peak that corresponded to either mono-or di-bromination (Figure 9A). Furthermore, the MS1 data showed a [M+12H]+12 ion that gave a deconvoluted",
        "6",
        "mass of 10,681 Da, which corresponds to the pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) substrate. The halogenase PltA mono-and di-chlorinated the pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) substrate, as evidenced by the presence of 388 m/z and 422 m/z MS2 peaks (Figure 9B). For the MS1 data, the predominant [M+11]+11 ion gave a deconvoluted mass of 10,749 Da, which is 68 Da higher than the pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) observed in the Bmp2 assay. The shift in mass can be explained by the exchange of two hydrogen atoms for two chlorine atoms, which should result in a 67.9 Da shift. This result shows that the predominant reaction product of PltA is di-chlorinated pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP). For Clz5, chlorinated product formation was less pronounced but still present (Figure 9C). The MS1 analysis of the predominant [M+11H]+11 ion gave a deconvoluted mass of 10,681 Da, once again corresponding to the pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP) substrate. However, analysis of the MS2 data shows ejection ions of 388 m/z and 354 m/z. This shows that Clz5 mono-chlorinates pyrrolyl-Mpy15 (CP), but no evidence of di-chlorination was found. Mpy16 assayed with its native CP, pyrrolyl-Mpy15, did chlorinate the substrate, showing evidence of both mono-and di-chlorination. MS1 analysis of the most prominent peak (the [M+11H]+11 ion) gave a deconvoluted mass of 10,715 Da, which is a 34 Da mass change indicative of mono-chlorination. Consistent with this, the highest intensity ion in the MS2 data was the 388 m/z ion along with 422 m/z and 354 m/z, corresponding to di-chlorinated product and pyrrolyl substrates respectively (Figure 9D). This result shows that Mpy16 can both mono-and di-chlorinate its natural substrate.  Conclusion  The results of the enzyme assays clearly show that halogenases can recognize pyrrolyl-CPs from across pathways and halogenate when analyzed by in vitro assays. The assays that showed no evidence of halogenation were mostly those involving Bmp2 as a halogenase, which could be explained by the specific preparation of Bmp2 used having lost its activity. The other assays that did not give evidence for halogenation were PltA with pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP) and Mpy16 with pyrrolyl-Bmp1 (CP). These enzymes in reaction showed chlorination activity, suggesting the observed result is not due to degradation of their activity. The selectivity that these enzymes display on pyrrolyl-CP substrate could be explained by protein-protein interactions between substrate and halogenase pair. It is possible that the CP and the halogenase must be in close proximity for their activity. Thus, there are likely to be motifs on both surfaces that facilitate interaction. The selectivity observed could be due to difference in amino acid residues between CP and halogenase pairs from different pathways. If some of these residues are different from species to species, it could lead to the selectivity that was observed.  One way to understand the protein-protein interaction between the halogenase and CP pairs is to crystallize them in complex and study the structure-function relationship between the two proteins. A similar strategy has recently been employed to determine the complex of a CP and an oxidase enzyme in the tetrabromopyrrole biosynthetic pathway (14). Such a crystal structure would provide a framework for visualizing the differences in amino acid sequence for each CP. In follow up to that, site mutagenesis experiments could be performed to validate information obtained from the structure of the CP and halogenase pairs complex.  This study of CP and halogenase selectivity has potential impacts in the pharmaceutical biosynthesis of halogenated molecules. Oftentimes, pharmaceuticals of interest have complicated chemical syntheses that can make it desirable to pursue a biosynthetic approach. By determining the selectivity of these CPs to related halogenase enzymes, we will be able to mix and match CP and halogenase pairs across pathways to obtain a designer natural product. Additionally, the results show that CPs and halogenases work together across a broad variety of bacterial sources.",
