Roberts, Yu Zhao, and Weiping Tang* ABSTRACT: Glutarimides such as thalidomide, pomalidomide, and lenalidomide are the most frequently used ligands to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon (CRBN) for the development of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). Due to the rapid and spontaneous racemization of glutarimides, most CRBN-recruiting PROTACs are synthesized as a mixture of racemates or diastereomers. Since the (S)-enantiomer is primarily responsible for binding to CRBN, the existence of the largely inactive (R)-enantiomer complicates the drug develop-ment process. Herein, we report that substituted achiral phenyl dihydrouracil (PDHU) can be used as a novel class of CRBN ligands for the development of PROTACs. Although the parent PDHU has a minimal binding affinity to CRBN, we found that some substituted PDHUs had a comparable binding affinity to lenalidomide. Structural modeling provided a further understanding of the molecular interactions between PDHU ligands and CRBN. PDHUs also have greater stability than lenalidomide. Finally, potent BRD4 degraders were developed by employing trisubstituted PDHUs. INTRODUCTION Targeted protein degradation has recently emerged as a promising modality for the development of therapeutics to address numerous unmet medical needs.1-5 Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is the most well-known strategy for the degradation of intracellular protein targets.6 PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that are composed of an E3 ubiquitin ligase binding motif, a linker, and a protein of interest (POI) binding motif. PROTACs can serve as a molecular adapter to induce the interactions between the POI and the E3 ligase, which in turn promotes polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the POI.7 Although there are over 600 ubiquitin ligase complexes in the human proteome, few of them have been employed for the development of PROTACs.1 Among them, CRBN is the most frequently utilized E3 ligase due to the low molecular weight and drug-like properties of its glutarimide ligands such as thalidomide 1A, pomalidomide 1B, and lenalidomide 1C (Figure 1).5,8-12 These glutarimides were first applied to the development of PROTACs for targeted protein degradation in 2015.13,14 The first two PROTACs that progressed into clinical trials (ARV-110 and ARV-471) both used glutarimide CRBN ligands. However, glutarimides are used as a racemic mixture in almost all reported PROTACs because the two enantiomers can undergo rapid and spontaneous racemization in vitro and in vivo. For example, the racemization half-life of thalidomide is \u223c2.0 h in human blood and \u223c5.0 h in vivo in humans, respectively.15 The binding affinity of the (S)-enantiomeric Figure 1. Comparison of the well-known glutarimides,13,14 the recently reported PG,28 and the designed achiral PDHU. A J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX thalidomide to CRBN is at least 10-fold stronger than the corresponding (R)-enantiomer.16,17 The DDB1-CRBN-thalidomide complex further confirms that only the (S)-enantiomer fits the binding pocket well. The glutarimide moiety is most critical for binding as three hydrogen bonds are formed between the imide motif and CRBN, whereas the phthalimide or the phthalimidine moiety is exposed to the solvent.18 The use of racemic glutarimide as the E3 ligase ligands in PROTACs complicates many aspects of the drug development process and is one of the significant barriers to the therapeutic applications of CRBN-recruiting PROTACs. For example, half of the PROTAC molecules that have poor degradation activity due to \u223c10-fold weaker binding affinity to CRBN can competitively inhibit the other half of the active portion because they bear the same POI ligand that can bind to the protein target. In addition, according to the FDA policy updated in 1992, more resources are needed to characterize the pharmacological properties of all isomers including enantiomers or diastereomers and their metabolites during the drug development process.19 To date, various CRBN ligands have been reported by researchers from both industry and academia; some of these reports include attempts to solve the chirality issue.20-24 For example, the racemization of deuterated thalidomide 1D, where the hydrogen is replaced by a deuterium, was about five times slower than thalidomide.25 If an all-carbon quaternary center was to be introduced, no racemization would occur. However, when the Y substituent in 1 was replaced by a methyl group, the corresponding compound 1E lost its activity.26,27 In addition to racemization, the stability of the glutarimides is another issue. One of the major breakthroughs for the development of CRBN ligands is the design of phenyl glutarimides (PGs) 1F for PROTACs during our study.28 Significantly higher stability was observed after the replacement of the phthalimide or phthalimidine motif in thalidomide, pomalidomide, and lenalidomide by a simple phenyl ring in the PGs. Herein, we report the development of achiral phenyl dihydrouracil (PDHU) 2 as the CRBN ligands for the development of nonracemic PROTACs. Although both PGs and dihydrouracils were described as CRBN ligands in several patents,20 the detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) and properties of the ligands were not disclosed, which prevent their broad applications for the development of PROTACs. We began our investigation by examining the conformations of simple glutarimide and dihydrouracil (Figure 1) by extracting the relevant X-ray structures 4CI118 and 1R2Z29 from the Protein Data Bank. Glutarimide has a half-chair conformation, where five atoms in the imide ring are in the same plane. The remaining methylene group in the ring and the \u201cG\u201d substituent are out of plane. In contrast, dihydrouracil is much flatter. The G-substituent on the nitrogen is in the same plane as the imide, while the carbonyl group pointed by the arrow and its adjacent methylene group are twisted out of plane slightly. Before our study, it is not clear how the different orientations of the G group and the twisted imide group will impact the binding of PDHU with the CRBN protein complex. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The parent PDHU 2 was prepared, and its binding with the CRBN-DDB1 complex was compared with positive control lenalidomide 1C using a known fluorescence polarization (FP) assay.18 Lenalidomide was used as the positive control for comparison with PDHU analogues and 84% of the fluorescence probe was displaced by 1 \u03bcM lenalidomide. All analogues were tested at a single concentration of 1 \u03bcM three times. As shown in Scheme 1, displacement observed for parent compound 2 was only around 20%, which is much worse than the 84% observed for lenalidomide positive control. This is not surprising based on the conformational analysis as discussed before. To improve the binding affinity, a series of disubstituted PDHUs were prepared. Various substituents were installed at the ortho-, meta-, and para-positions of the phenyl group in PDHUs systematically and compared with the parent compound 2 for relative binding affinity. Interestingly, analogue 3A with an ortho hydroxyl substituent almost completely lost the binding, while analogues 4A and 5A with a meta and para OH enhanced the binding to 57% and 38%, respectively. Methyl, ethyl, and chloro substituents on the ortho-position (3B, 3D, and 3E) improved the binding to 35%, 29%, and 36% from the original 20% for the parent compound 2. Compound 3C with a methoxy substituent on the ortho-position decreased the binding while placing the MeO on the meta-position (4C) improved the binding to 33%. Compounds 4F and 4K bearing longer substituents on the meta-position further improved the binding to 56 and 44%, respectively. Scheme 1. Relative Binding Affinities of Substituted PDHUs in a Fluorescent Polarization Assaya aLenalidomide 1C was used as the positive control and each compound was tested three times. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX B Substituents on the para-positions were also tolerated, though they did not improve the binding as much as those on the meta-positions as shown in 5A and 5K. Based on the SAR of the disubstituted PDHUs, we designed the second series of trisubstituted PDHUs. Considering the binding affinity observed for disubstituted PDHUs, ligand efficiency, metabolic stability, and magic methyl effect,30,31 ortho methyl was selected to explore its synergetic effect of binding improvement with the third substituent. Various 1,2,3-, 1,2,5-, and 1,2,4-trisubstituted PDHUs were designed, synthesized, and compared with the lenalidomide positive control and compound 3B with an ortho methyl substituent. We prepared more compounds with meta-substituents on the phenyl group of PDHUs since our results from the disubstituted PDHUs indicated that meta-substituents im-proved the binding more than the para-substituents. Among different groups, substituent A and F had the strongest synergetic effect. For example, the binding of 6F and 7A were improved to 78 and 81%, respectively. Most other trisub-stituted PDHUs also showed better binding affinity than 3B. It is easiest to install linkers to the phenyl group on PDHUs bearing building blocks F and K for the development of PROTACs. We hypothesize that the tBu group in these two building blocks can be replaced by various linkers for the development of nonracemic PROTACs that can recruit CRBN. With these in mind, we next measured the Kds for lenalidomide 1C, parent PDHU 2, monosubstituted PDHU 3B, disubstituted PDHU 4F, and trisubstituted PDUs 6F and 6K for further comparison (Figure 2). The Kd (0.17 \u03bcM) we observed in the FP assay for lenalidomide 1C is very close to what was reported in the literature (Kd = 0.18 \u03bcM).18 Parent PDHU 2 is 18 times weaker than lenalidomide 1C. The installation of an ortho-Me in 3B increased the affinity about 2.5 times. We were pleased to find that 1,2,3-trisubstituted PDHU 6F has a comparable Kd to lenalidomide. The difference between 6F and 4F confirms that the ortho-and meta-substituents in 6F both contributed to the binding. Interestingly, the meta-substituent in PDHU 6K does not further increase the binding compared to 3B. We then prepared compounds 9 and 10 by replacing the tBu with an amide functional group to confirm this observation. Similar Kds were observed for compounds 6K, 9, and 10. We also extended the propargyl amide linker in 6F to homopropargyl amide in 11. Surprisingly, the affinity dropped three-fold in this case. To establish a binding mode of the achiral ligands and rationalize the observed binding affinity trends, structural modeling was performed for representative structure 6F based on docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) refinement (Figure 3). The refinement allows both the ligand and protein to fully relax since ligand-induced changes may occur on protein side chains. Additionally, ligand binding stabilities can be observed during the refinement process, including filtering out false-positive poses. The MD refinement procedure is similar to our previous method used for PROTAC modeling.32 From these results, we observed that the carbamate carbonyl oxygen of 6F forms a H-bond with neighboring Histidine 353. The phenyl, 2-methyl, 3-alkyne group, and Boc t-butyl all form hydrophobic contacts with the protein. When the rigid alkyne is removed for 6K, 9, and 10, the direct hydrophobic contacts will be diminished and the H-bond will be disturbed. Compound 4F being slightly weaker than 6F is attributed to less hydrophobic space filling lacking the 2-methyl. Compound 11 with a rigid alkyne linker is expected to also form good contacts, but the extended linker length disturbs the H-bond with the carbonyl oxygen. Detailed procedures of the modeling and more images are provided in the Supporting Information. We then further evaluated the stability of selected compounds (6F and 9-11) in human liver microsomes (hLM), human plasma (hP), and buffer with different pHs (Table 1). Both compounds 6F and 9-11 showed comparable stability to lenalidomide in hLM. In terms of stability in hP, only 62% of lenalidomide remained after 4 h of incubation. In contrast, 97% of 6F and over 80% of 9-11 remained under the same conditions. Under acidic conditions (pH = 1.0), all compounds are very stable. However, under neutral conditions that mimic the physiological environment (pH = 7.4 buffer), only 39% of lenalidomide remained after 24 h of incubation at Figure 2.

PDHUs 6F and 9-11 are much more stable than lenalidomide at slightly basic conditions (e.g., pH = 8.8). Other than racemization, the ring opening of glutarimides by hydrolysis is a liability of CRBN-recruiting PROTACs.33,34 Our results showed that the dihydrouracil motif has much higher stability and is less prone to hydrolysis. Based on the above data, we can conclude that the achiral CRBN ligands with 1,2,3-trisubstituted PDHUs such as 6F can have similar binding affinity and much better stability profiles compared to lenalidomide. It is well known that the binding of thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, their analogues, or certain PROTACs bearing the glutarimide motif to CRBN can induce the degradation of neo-substrates, such as IKZF1, IKZF3, and GSPT1.1-5 The neo-substrate degradation activity can be changed by modifying the structure of the CRBN ligand, the linking site, the property of the linker, or even the ligand of the POI in PROTACs. We next tested compounds 6F and 9-11 in MV4; 11 cells at two different concentrations (10 and 1 \u03bcM) for the degradation of IKZF1, IKZF3, and GSPT1. Western blot analysis indicated that these four compounds did not induce the degradation of IKZF1, IKZF3, or GSPT1 (Figures 4A-C). Although this is encouraging, the selectivity of specific PROTACs bearing the achiral PDHU ligand should be examined thoroughly for the development of any therapeutics as the selectivity depends on the entire structure of the PROTAC. The discovery of the achiral CRBN ligands provides an opportunity to develop various stereochemically well-defined PROTACs that can recruit CRBN. To demonstrate the utility of these new CRBN ligands (e.g., 6F and 9-11), we attached JQ1, a well-known ligand for BRD4, to the 1,2,3-trisubstituted PDHU and prepared potential BRD4 degraders 12A-12C, 13, and 14 bearing several different linkers (Figure 5). These compounds were then tested in four different cell lines at two different concentrations (1.0 and 0.1 \u03bcM) for the degradation of BRD4. Western blot analysis indicated that compounds 12B, 13, and 14 could induce the degradation of BRD4 protein in all four cell lines. Compound 12C showed obvious BRD4 degradation activity in MV4; 11 and LNCAP; however, 12A bearing the shortest linker did not display activity in all four cell lines (Figure 6A). While compounds 12B, 13, and 14 displayed the most potent activity, compound 13 appeared to be slightly more potent. Our results indicated that the degradation efficiency was related to multiple parameters such as the length and type of linkers in addition to the binding affinity of the achiral ligand to CRBN. Compound 13 was then selected for further characterization. We first studied the time course and dose-response of degrader 13 (Figure 6B-E). Degradation of BRD4 occurred as early as 1 h post-treatment (Figure 6B). Degrader 13 also induced significant degradation of BRD4 at pM concentrations in MV4; 11 cells with a DC50 of 22 pM and Dmax of 97% (Figure 6C,D). We also verified the degradation effect of degrader 13 in a Flp-In-293 cell line that stably expresses eGFP-tagged BRD4 bromodomain (BD1) fusion and a nontargeted mCherry endogenous control (Figure 6E).35 In the Flp-In-293 cells, a DC50 of 34 nM and a Dmax of 75% at 10 \u03bcM were observed. Interestingly, no obvious \u201cHook effect\u201d36 was observed with up to 10 \u03bcM for degrader 13. The degrader was successful in inducing caspase 3 cleavage, a biomarker for cell apoptosis, at 10 nM to 10 \u03bcM concentrations. Table 1.

BRD4 degraders with achiral CRBN ligands. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX D We next verified the mechanism of action of degrader 13 (Figure 6G-H). Pretreatment of the cells with POI ligand JQ1, achiral CRBN ligand 9, proteasome inhibitor MG132, and neddylation inhibitor MLN492437 abolished the BRD4 degradation induced by 13, suggesting that the degradation involves the engagement of BRD4, CRBN, proteasome, and Cullin-RING E3 ligase complex. We also prepared negative control 13NT, which has an additional methyl group on the imide motif that prevents the binding to CRBN.18 As expected, no degradation activity of BRD4 was observed for 13NT in MV4; 11 cells at several different concentrations, further confirming the involvement of CRBN (Figure 6H). Finally, a side-by-side comparison of degrader 13 with dBET1 was performed in MV4; 11 cells. Degrader 13 showed more potent BRD4 degradation activity than dBET1 (Figure 6I). We next investigated the functional outcomes of degrader 13 bearing an achiral CRBN ligand including cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and cell apoptosis (Figure 7). First, MV4; 11 cells were treated by BRD4 degraders 13, POI ligand (+)-JQ1, CRBN ligand 9, and compound 13NT for 72 h. As expected, compound 13 showed the most potent antiproliferation activity with an IC50 value of around 1.1 nM (Figure 7A). POI ligand (+)-JQ1 showed weaker antiproliferation activity than 13 but higher activity than compound 13NT, which has a very similar structure to 13 but without CRBN recruiting ability. Compound 9, which has the entire CRBN ligand and most parts of the linker, did not show any antiproliferation activity at up to 100 \u03bcM. All these trends are expected and consistent with their mechanism of action. BRD4 degraders 13 could also induce G1 phase arrest, decrease the cell population Figure 6. (A) Western blot of BRD4.

Achiral CRBN ligands and BRD4 PROTACs were synthesized as shown in Scheme 2. Various substituted PDHUs S2 can be prepared from the corresponding anilines S1 by adapting literature procedures through conjugate addition followed by cyclization (eq 1).38 More substituents can be introduced to the phenyl group of PDHUs by Sonogashira coupling (eq 2), alkylation (eqs 3 and 6), Suzuki cross-coupling (eq 4), or Heck cross-coupling (eq 5). Further manipulations such as reduction (eq 7) and deprotection of the Boc group, followed by amide formation can afford ligands 6G, 9, and 11, respectively. BRD4 PROTACs bearing achiral CRBN ligands were synthesized as shown in Scheme 3. Removal of the Boc protecting group in intermediate S4 followed by amide coupling with JQ1 afforded PROTACs 12A-C. Removal of the tBu protecting group in intermediate S5 followed by coupling with a linker, deprotection, and reaction with JQ1 yielded PROTACs 13 and 14 and the negative control 13NT. CONCLUSIONS Racemization has been a long-standing issue for most CRBN-recruiting PROTACs. Due to the racemization between active and inactive enantiomers, CRBN-based PROTACs face not only the issue of half of the PROTAC molecules possessing low E3-ligase binding activity but also the issue of these low-potency molecules acting as inhibitors to compete with the other half of active PROTACs at the POI binding site. In addition, half of the PROTACs with low E3 ligase binding activity also produce various metabolites that require addi-tional characterization and careful monitoring. These issues significantly complicate the development and manufacturing of PROTACs as therapeutics. Although many molecular glues and PROTACs bearing a racemic CRBN ligand have successfully entered into clinical trials or gained approval, more resources are required to characterize the pharmaco-logical properties of the inactive isomeric compounds according to the FDA policy.19 We have developed various substituted PDHUs as a novel class of achiral CRBN ligands and discovered interesting SARs. Although there is only one atom change from PGs to PDHUs, the conformation of the dihydrouracil ring in PDHU becomes much flatter than the glutarimide ring in PGs, which results in much weaker binding affinity of the parent PDHU than the parent PG. Through the SAR study of a series of disubstituted and trisubstituted PDHUs, we found that substituted achiral PDHUs could achieve similar binding affinities to lenalidomide but with much higher stability. Structural modeling studies revealed the additional interactions one can pick up by adding various substituents to the phenyl group, which provides a path for further optimization in the future. Finally, five 1,2,3-trisubstituted PDHU-based BRD4 PROTACs were designed and synthesized. Their remarkable BRD4 degradation activities were verified in multiple cell lines and two orthogonal methods\ufffdwestern blot analysis of the endogenous BRD4 and fluorescent quantification of BRD4BD1-eGFP fusion protein, demonstrating that substituted PDHUs can be used for the development of nonracemic CRBN-recruiting PRO-TACs. We anticipate that the readily accessible substituted PDHUs such as 6F and 9 will be widely used for the development of various PROTACs. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Cell Culture.

The plasmid (0.4 \u03bcg) and pOG44 (3.6 \u03bcg) DNA were preincubated in Opti-MEM media with 12 \u03bcL of FuGene HD and added to Flp-In 293 cells (REF R75007, Thermo Fisher) containing Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) per well in a 6-well plate format. Cells were propagated after 48 h and transferred into a 10 cm2 plate in DMEM containing 50 \u03bcg/mL hygromycin B as a selection marker. Positive colonies were split into a 60 mm dish until confluent and subsequently propagated. eGFP and mCherry signals were confirmed by flow cytometry for assay validation. Cells were seeded at 5 \u00d7 105 per well in 24-well plates 1 day prior to compound treatment. Titrated compounds were incubated with cells for 24 h followed by detachment and resuspension in PBS with 2% FBS, filtration, and transferred into 5 mL polystyrene tubes for analysis by flow cytometry (Attune, Thermo Fisher). Signals from at least 50,000 events per well were acquired, and the eGFP and mCherry fluorescence were monitored. Data were analyzed using FlowJo (FlowJo, LCC). Forward and side scatter outliers were removed by gating. The eGFP signal abundance relative to mCherry was then quantified as a 10-fold amplified ratio using the formula: 10 \u00d7 eGFP/mCherry. The median fluorescence intensity was calculated for eGFP and mCherry for each sample and normalized to the DMSO ratio. General Information in Synthetic Chemistry.

    "abstract": "Glutarimides such as thalidomide, pomalidomide, andlenalidomide are the most frequently used ligands to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon (CRBN) for the development of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). Due to the rapid and spontaneous racemization of glutarimides, most CRBN-recruiting PROTACs are synthesized as a mixture of racemates or diastereomers. Since the (S)-enantiomer is primarily responsible for binding to CRBN, the existence of the largely inactive (R)-enantiomer complicates the drug develop-ment process. Herein, we report that substituted achiral phenyl dihydrouracil (PDHU) can be used as a novel class of CRBN ligands for the development of PROTACs. Although the parent PDHU has a minimal binding affinity to CRBN, we found that some substituted PDHUs had a comparable binding affinity to lenalidomide. Structural modeling provided a further understanding of the molecular interactions between PDHU ligands and CRBN. PDHUs also have greater stability than lenalidomide. Finally, potent BRD4 degraders were developed by employing trisubstituted PDHUs.",
    "introduction": [
        "Targeted protein degradation has recently emerged as a promising modality for the development of therapeutics to address numerous unmet medical needs.1-5 Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is the most well-known strategy for the degradation of intracellular protein targets.6 PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that are composed of an E3 ubiquitin ligase binding motif, a linker, and a protein of interest (POI) binding motif. PROTACs can serve as a molecular adapter to induce the interactions between the POI and the E3 ligase, which in turn promotes polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the POI.7 Although there are over 600 ubiquitin ligase complexes in the human proteome, few of them have been employed for the development of PROTACs.1 Among them, CRBN is the most frequently utilized E3 ligase due to the low molecular weight and drug-like properties of its glutarimide ligands such as thalidomide 1A, pomalidomide 1B, and lenalidomide 1C (Figure 1).5,8-12 These glutarimides were first applied to the development of PROTACs for targeted protein degradation in 2015.13,14 The first two PROTACs that progressed into clinical trials (ARV-110 and ARV-471) both used glutarimide CRBN ligands. However, glutarimides are used as a racemic mixture in almost all reported PROTACs because the two enantiomers can undergo rapid and spontaneous racemization in vitro and in vivo. For example, the racemization half-life of thalidomide is \u223c2.0 h in human blood and \u223c5.0 h in vivo in humans, respectively.15 The binding affinity of the (S)-enantiomeric Figure 1. Comparison of the well-known glutarimides,13,14 the recently reported PG,28 and the designed achiral PDHU. A J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX thalidomide to CRBN is at least 10-fold stronger than the corresponding (R)-enantiomer.16,17 The DDB1-CRBN-thalidomide complex further confirms that only the (S)-enantiomer fits the binding pocket well. The glutarimide moiety is most critical for binding as three hydrogen bonds are formed between the imide motif and CRBN, whereas the phthalimide or the phthalimidine moiety is exposed to the solvent.18",
        "The use of racemic glutarimide as the E3 ligase ligands in PROTACs complicates many aspects of the drug development process and is one of the significant barriers to the therapeutic applications of CRBN-recruiting PROTACs. For example, half of the PROTAC molecules that have poor degradation activity due to \u223c10-fold weaker binding affinity to CRBN can competitively inhibit the other half of the active portion because they bear the same POI ligand that can bind to the protein target. In addition, according to the FDA policy updated in 1992, more resources are needed to characterize the pharmacological properties of all isomers including enantiomers or diastereomers and their metabolites during the drug development process.19 To date, various CRBN ligands have been reported by researchers from both industry and academia; some of these reports include attempts to solve the chirality issue.20-24 For example, the racemization of deuterated thalidomide 1D, where the hydrogen is replaced by a deuterium, was about five times slower than thalidomide.25 If an all-carbon quaternary center was to be introduced, no racemization would occur. However, when the Y substituent in 1 was replaced by a methyl group, the corresponding compound 1E lost its activity.26,27 In addition to racemization, the stability of the glutarimides is another issue. One of the major breakthroughs for the development of CRBN ligands is the design of phenyl glutarimides (PGs) 1F for PROTACs during our study.28 Significantly higher stability was observed after the replacement of the phthalimide or phthalimidine motif in thalidomide, pomalidomide, and lenalidomide by a simple phenyl ring in the PGs. Herein, we report the development of achiral phenyl dihydrouracil (PDHU) 2 as the CRBN ligands for the development of nonracemic PROTACs. Although both PGs and dihydrouracils were described as CRBN ligands in several patents,20 the detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) and properties of the ligands were not disclosed, which prevent their broad applications for the development of PROTACs.",
        "We began our investigation by examining the conformations of simple glutarimide and dihydrouracil (Figure 1) by extracting the relevant X-ray structures 4CI118 and 1R2Z29 from the Protein Data Bank. Glutarimide has a half-chair conformation, where five atoms in the imide ring are in the same plane. The remaining methylene group in the ring and the \u201cG\u201d substituent are out of plane. In contrast, dihydrouracil is much flatter. The G-substituent on the nitrogen is in the same plane as the imide, while the carbonyl group pointed by the arrow and its adjacent methylene group are twisted out of plane slightly. Before our study, it is not clear how the different orientations of the G group and the twisted imide group will impact the binding of PDHU with the CRBN protein complex."

        "The parent PDHU 2 was prepared, and its binding with the CRBN-DDB1 complex was compared with positive control lenalidomide 1C using a known fluorescence polarization (FP) assay.18 Lenalidomide was used as the positive control for comparison with PDHU analogues and 84% of the fluorescence probe was displaced by 1 \u03bcM lenalidomide. All analogues were tested at a single concentration of 1 \u03bcM three times. As shown in Scheme 1, displacement observed for parent compound 2 was only around 20%, which is much worse than the 84% observed for lenalidomide positive control. This is not surprising based on the conformational analysis as discussed before. To improve the binding affinity, a series of disubstituted PDHUs were prepared. Various substituents were installed at the ortho-, meta-, and para-positions of the phenyl group in PDHUs systematically and compared with the parent compound 2 for relative binding affinity. Interestingly, analogue 3A with an ortho hydroxyl substituent almost completely lost the binding, while analogues 4A and 5A with a meta and para OH enhanced the binding to 57% and 38%, respectively. Methyl, ethyl, and chloro substituents on the ortho-position (3B, 3D, and 3E) improved the binding to 35%, 29%, and 36% from the original 20% for the parent compound 2. Compound 3C with a methoxy substituent on the ortho-position decreased the binding while placing the MeO on the meta-position (4C) improved the binding to 33%. Compounds 4F and 4K bearing longer substituents on the meta-position further improved the binding to 56 and 44%, respectively. Scheme 1. Relative Binding Affinities of Substituted PDHUs in a Fluorescent Polarization Assaya aLenalidomide 1C was used as the positive control and each compound was tested three times. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article J. Med. Chem. XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXX B Substituents on the para-positions were also tolerated, though they did not improve the binding as much as those on the meta-positions as shown in 5A and 5K.",
        "Based on the SAR of the disubstituted PDHUs, we designed the second series of trisubstituted PDHUs. Considering the binding affinity observed for disubstituted PDHUs, ligand efficiency, metabolic stability, and magic methyl effect,30,31 ortho methyl was selected to explore its synergetic effect of binding improvement with the third substituent. Various 1,2,3-, 1,2,5-, and 1,2,4-trisubstituted PDHUs were designed, synthesized, and compared with the lenalidomide positive control and compound 3B with an ortho methyl substituent. We prepared more compounds with meta-substituents on the phenyl group of PDHUs since our results from the disubstituted PDHUs indicated that meta-substituents im-proved the binding more than the para-substituents. Among different groups, substituent A and F had the strongest synergetic effect. For example, the binding of 6F and 7A were improved to 78 and 81%, respectively. Most other trisub-stituted PDHUs also showed better binding affinity than 3B.",
        "It is easiest to install linkers to the phenyl group on PDHUs bearing building blocks F and K for the development of PROTACs. We hypothesize that the tBu group in these two building blocks can be replaced by various linkers for the development of nonracemic PROTACs that can recruit CRBN. With these in mind, we next measured the Kds for lenalidomide 1C, parent PDHU 2, monosubstituted PDHU 3B, disubstituted PDHU 4F, and trisubstituted PDUs 6F and 6K for further comparison (Figure 2). The Kd (0.17 \u03bcM) we observed in the FP assay for lenalidomide 1C is very close to what was reported in the literature (Kd = 0.18 \u03bcM).18 Parent PDHU 2 is 18 times weaker than lenalidomide 1C. The installation of an ortho-Me in 3B increased the affinity about 2.5 times. We were pleased to find that 1,2,3-trisubstituted PDHU 6F has a comparable Kd to lenalidomide. The difference between 6F and 4F confirms that the ortho-and meta-substituents in 6F both contributed to the binding. Interestingly, the meta-substituent in PDHU 6K does not further increase the binding compared to 3B. We then prepared compounds 9 and 10 by replacing the tBu with an amide functional group to confirm this observation. Similar Kds were observed for compounds 6K, 9, and 10. We also extended the propargyl amide linker in 6F to homopropargyl amide in 11. Surprisingly, the affinity dropped three-fold in this case.",
        "To establish a binding mode of the achiral ligands and rationalize the observed binding affinity trends, structural modeling was performed for representative structure 6F based on docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) refinement (Figure 3). The refinement allows both the ligand and protein to fully relax since ligand-induced changes may occur on protein side chains. Additionally, ligand binding stabilities can be observed during the refinement process, including filtering out false-positive poses. The MD refinement procedure is similar to our previous method used for PROTAC modeling.32 From these results, we observed that the carbamate carbonyl oxygen of 6F forms a H-bond with neighboring Histidine 353. The phenyl, 2-methyl, 3-alkyne group, and Boc t-butyl all form hydrophobic contacts with the protein. When the rigid alkyne is removed for 6K, 9, and 10, the direct hydrophobic contacts will be diminished and the H-bond will be disturbed. Compound 4F being slightly weaker than 6F is attributed to less hydrophobic space filling lacking the 2-methyl. Compound 11 with a rigid alkyne linker is expected to also form good contacts, but the extended linker length disturbs the H-bond with the carbonyl oxygen. Detailed procedures of the modeling and more images are provided in the Supporting Information.",
        "We then further evaluated the stability of selected compounds (6F and 9-11) in human liver microsomes (hLM), human plasma (hP), and buffer with different pHs (Table 1). Both compounds 6F and 9-11 showed comparable stability to lenalidomide in hLM. In terms of stability in hP, only 62% of lenalidomide remained after 4 h of incubation. In contrast, 97% of 6F and over 80% of 9-11 remained under the same conditions. Under acidic conditions (pH = 1.0), all compounds are very stable. However, under neutral conditions that mimic the physiological environment (pH = 7.4 buffer), only 39% of lenalidomide remained after 24 h of incubation at Figure 2. Binding affinities of lenalidomide and selected PDHUs in a fluorescent polarization assay. (Detailed procedures are provided in the Supporting Information). Figure 3. Binding poses of 6F based on computational modeling. The dark sticks are from 6F, and a key H-bond between the amide and histidine is marked out with a straight line. Image generated by UCSF Chimera.

PDHUs 6F and 9-11 are much more stable than lenalidomide at slightly basic conditions (e.g., pH = 8.8). Other than racemization, the ring opening of glutarimides by hydrolysis is a liability of CRBN-recruiting PROTACs.33,34 Our results showed that the dihydrouracil motif has much higher stability and is less prone to hydrolysis. Based on the above data, we can conclude that the achiral CRBN ligands with 1,2,3-trisubstituted PDHUs such as 6F can have similar binding affinity and much better stability profiles compared to lenalidomide.",
        "It is well known that the binding of thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, their analogues, or certain PROTACs bearing the glutarimide motif to CRBN can induce the degradation of neo-substrates, such as IKZF1, IKZF3, and GSPT1.1-5 The neo-substrate degradation activity can be changed by modifying the structure of the CRBN ligand, the linking site, the property of the linker, or even the ligand of the POI in PROTACs. We next tested compounds 6F and 9-11 in MV4; 11 cells at two different concentrations (10 and 1 \u03bcM) for the degradation of IKZF1, IKZF3, and GSPT1. Western blot analysis indicated that these four compounds did not induce the degradation of IKZF1, IKZF3, or GSPT1 (Figures 4A-C). Although this is encouraging, the selectivity of specific PROTACs bearing the achiral PDHU ligand should be examined thoroughly for the development of any therapeutics as the selectivity depends on the entire structure of the PROTAC.",
        "The discovery of the achiral CRBN ligands provides an opportunity to develop various stereochemically well-defined PROTACs that can recruit CRBN. To demonstrate the utility of these new CRBN ligands (e.g., 6F and 9-11), we attached JQ1, a well-known ligand for BRD4, to the 1,2,3-trisubstituted PDHU and prepared potential BRD4 degraders 12A-12C, 13, and 14 bearing several different linkers (Figure 5). These compounds were then tested in four different cell lines at two different concentrations (1.0 and 0.1 \u03bcM) for the degradation of BRD4. Western blot analysis indicated that compounds 12B, 13, and 14 could induce the degradation of BRD4 protein in all four cell lines. Compound 12C showed obvious BRD4 degradation activity in MV4; 11 and LNCAP; however, 12A bearing the shortest linker did not display activity in all four cell lines (Figure 6A). While compounds 12B, 13, and 14 displayed the most potent activity, compound 13 appeared to be slightly more potent. Our results indicated that the degradation efficiency was related to multiple parameters such as the length and type of linkers in addition to the binding affinity of the achiral ligand to CRBN. Compound 13 was then selected for further characterization. We first studied the time course and dose-response of degrader 13 (Figure 6B-E). Degradation of BRD4 occurred as early as 1 h post-treatment (Figure 6B). Degrader 13 also induced significant degradation of BRD4 at pM concentrations in MV4; 11 cells with a DC50 of 22 pM and Dmax of 97% (Figure 6C,D). We also verified the degradation effect of degrader 13 in a Flp-In-293 cell line that stably expresses eGFP-tagged BRD4 bromodomain (BD1) fusion and a nontargeted mCherry endogenous control (Figure 6E).35 In the Flp-In-293 cells, a DC50 of 34 nM and a Dmax of 75% at 10 \u03bcM were observed. Interestingly, no obvious \u201cHook effect\u201d36 was observed with up to 10 \u03bcM for degrader 13. The degrader was successful in inducing caspase 3 cleavage, a biomarker for cell apoptosis, at 10 nM to 10 \u03bcM concentrations. Table 1. Stability of Lenalidomide and 1,2,3-Trisubstituted PDHUs",

        "We next verified the mechanism of action of degrader 13 (Figure 6G-H). Pretreatment of the cells with POI ligand JQ1, achiral CRBN ligand 9, proteasome inhibitor MG132, and neddylation inhibitor MLN492437 abolished the BRD4 degradation induced by 13, suggesting that the degradation involves the engagement of BRD4, CRBN, proteasome, and Cullin-RING E3 ligase complex. We also prepared negative control 13NT, which has an additional methyl group on the imide motif that prevents the binding to CRBN.18 As expected, no degradation activity of BRD4 was observed for 13NT in MV4; 11 cells at several different concentrations, further confirming the involvement of CRBN (Figure 6H). Finally, a side-by-side comparison of degrader 13 with dBET1 was performed in MV4; 11 cells. Degrader 13 showed more potent BRD4 degradation activity than dBET1 (Figure 6I).",
        "We next investigated the functional outcomes of degrader 13 bearing an achiral CRBN ligand including cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and cell apoptosis (Figure 7). First, MV4; 11 cells were treated by BRD4 degraders 13, POI ligand (+)-JQ1, CRBN ligand 9, and compound 13NT for 72 h. As expected, compound 13 showed the most potent antiproliferation activity with an IC50 value of around 1.1 nM (Figure 7A). POI ligand (+)-JQ1 showed weaker antiproliferation activity than 13 but higher activity than compound 13NT, which has a very similar structure to 13 but without CRBN recruiting ability. Compound 9, which has the entire CRBN ligand and most parts of the linker, did not show any antiproliferation activity at up to 100 \u03bcM.

    "conclusions": [
        "Racemization has been a long-standing issue for most CRBN-recruiting PROTACs. Due to the racemization between active and inactive enantiomers, CRBN-based PROTACs face not only the issue of half of the PROTAC molecules possessing low E3-ligase binding activity but also the issue of these low-potency molecules acting as inhibitors to compete with the other half of active PROTACs at the POI binding site. In addition, half of the PROTACs with low E3 ligase binding activity also produce various metabolites that require addi-tional characterization and careful monitoring. These issues significantly complicate the development and manufacturing of PROTACs as therapeutics. Although many molecular glues and PROTACs bearing a racemic CRBN ligand have successfully entered into clinical trials or gained approval, more resources are required to characterize the pharmaco-logical properties of the inactive isomeric compounds according to the FDA policy.19 We have developed various substituted PDHUs as a novel class of achiral CRBN ligands and discovered interesting SARs. Although there is only one atom change from PGs to PDHUs, the conformation of the dihydrouracil ring in PDHU becomes much flatter than the glutarimide ring in PGs, which results in much weaker binding affinity of the parent PDHU than the parent PG. Through the SAR study of a series of disubstituted and trisubstituted PDHUs, we found that substituted achiral PDHUs could achieve similar binding affinities to lenalidomide but with much higher stability. Structural modeling studies revealed the additional interactions one can pick up by adding various substituents to the phenyl group, which provides a path for further optimization in the future. Finally, five 1,2,3-trisubstituted PDHU-based BRD4 PROTACs were designed and synthesized. Their remarkable BRD4 degradation activities were verified in multiple cell lines and two orthogonal methods\ufffdwestern blot analysis of the endogenous BRD4 and fluorescent quantification of BRD4BD1-eGFP fusion protein, demonstrating that substituted PDHUs can be used for the development of nonracemic CRBN-recruiting PRO-TACs. We anticipate that the readily accessible substituted PDHUs such as 6F and 9 will be widely used for the development of various PROTACs."
