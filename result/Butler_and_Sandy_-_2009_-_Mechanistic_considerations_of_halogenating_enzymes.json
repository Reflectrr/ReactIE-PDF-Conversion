These halogenated compounds range from peptides, polyketides, indoles, ter-penes, acetogenins and phenols to volatile halogenated hydrocarbons (for example bromoform, chloroform and dibromomethane) that are produced on a very large scale1\u20133. Many halogenated marine metabo-lites possess biological activities of pharmacological interest, including anticancer, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. The biogenesis of these compounds has intrigued scientists for decades.The first halogenating enzyme to be discovered, in the 1960s, was the haem (iron-containing porphyrin) chloroperoxidase (CPO) from the terrestrial fungus Caldariomyces fumago, which produces the chlori-nated natural product caldariomycin4. Some time later, haloperoxidase enzymes were proposed in the biogenesis of certain halogenated marine natural products5,6, although this was long before haloperoxidases or other halogenating enzymes had been discovered in marine organisms. Since the discovery of haem CPO, other haem haloperoxidases7\u20139, vanadium haloperoxidases10\u201312 and non-haem iron halogenases13, as well as non-metallo-, flavin-dependent halogenases14, SAM-dependent chlorinases and fluorinases15, and methyl halide transferases16, have been discovered. For recent reviews, see refs 14, 15, 17\u201323.Haloperoxidases catalyse electrophilic halogenation reactions, whereas the non-haem iron halogenases catalyse radical halogenation reactions and SAM-dependent halogenases catalyse nucleophilic halogenation reac-tions. Haloperoxidases have traditionally been classified on the basis of the most electrophilic halide that is readily oxidized. Thus, chloroperoxi-dases oxidize chloride, bromide and iodide by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), whereas iodoperoxidases oxidize only iodide in this way. Hydrogen perox-ide lacks the thermodynamic potential to oxidize fluoride; thus, enzymes catalysing fluorination are not peroxidases. The overall stoichiometry of the haloperoxidase reaction is consumption of one equivalent of H2O2 per halogenated product produced (Fig. 2, reaction 1).One class of halogenase, the non-haem iron enzymes, uses dioxygen (O2) to activate halide (Fig. 2, reaction 2); these enzymes catalyse radical halogenation reactions at aliphatic carbon sites. The overall stoichiom-etry is consumption of one equivalent of \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid and O2 per halogenated equivalent produced (Fig. 2, reaction 2). Flavin-dependent halogenases activate O2 by means of formation of flavin-bound hydroper-oxide, which then oxidizes the halide (Fig. 2, reaction 3). This class of halo-genating enzyme is a two-component system in which a flavin reductase is required to keep the halogenase reduced for catalytic turnover. These enzymes catalyse reactions that more closely resemble the electrophilic haloperoxidases that are mediated by \u2018HOX-like\u2019 species. Finally, SAM-dependent enzymes catalyse nucleophilic substitution, generating 5\u0374-halo-5\u0374-deoxyadenosine and l-methionine (Fig. 2, reaction 4). In this review we focus on the mechanisms of metalloenzyme-catalysed halogenation reactions, emphasizing the activation of halides by O2 and H2O2, and the nature of the halogenation step.In nature, halogenation is a strategy used to increase the biological activity of secondary metabolites, compounds that are often effective as drugs. However, halides are not particularly reactive unless they are activated, typically by oxidation. The pace of discovery of new enzymes for halogenation is increasing, revealing new metalloenzymes, flavoenzymes, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent enzymes and others that catalyse halide oxidation using dioxygen, hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxides, or that promote nucleophilic halide addition reactions.1Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA.Mechanistic considerations of halogenating enzymesAlison Butler1 & Moriah Sandy1Figure 1 | Halogenated natural products.\u2002A few examples of halogenated natural products that have been discovered in the past few decades.

The optimal pH for chlorination turnover by haem CPO is pH 2.7 (ref. 4). Interest-ingly, CPO is used to catalyse a number of oxidation reactions in the absence of chloride. These oxidation reactions are generally carried out at neutral pH, whereas chlorination occurs only at low pH. The active site of Fe(iii)-haem CPO contains Fe(iii)-protoporphyrin IX coordi-nated by the thiolate side chain of a cysteine in the proximal position24. Recently the X-ray structure of Fe(iii)-haem CPO was determined with the substrate, 1,3-cyclopentanedione (CPD), bound in one of the two channels leading to the haem iron centre (Fig. 3)25. In addition, halide-binding sites were identified at the protein surface near the opening of the second, narrower, channel leading to the haem iron moiety, as well as within this channel and at the other end of the channel, near the haem iron site25.A haem bromoperoxidase isolated from the marine green alga Peni-cillus capitatus contains a distal His ligand in place of the cysteine lig-and in Fe(iii)-haem CPO7,8. This enzyme uses bromide preferentially, although under certain conditions it can catalyse chlorination reactions8. Although the thiolate ligand was initially thought to be important for CPO activity, and His for bromoperoxidase activity in the haem haloper-oxidases, a haem CPO with a distal His ligand has been isolated from the marine worm Notomastus lobatus9. This enzyme is unusual in that it requires a partner flavoprotein for activity.The haem iron centre functions as a redox catalyst (Fig. 4). Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the haem Fe(iii) centre to compound I, the Fe(iv)-oxo \u03c0-cation radical species (O=Fe(iv)-haem+\u2022), via the short-lived com-pound-0 state, characterized as a peroxo-anion complex, HOO\u2013Fe(iii)-haem26. Glu 183 is proposed to assist in formation of both compound 0 and compound I. Compound I oxidizes chloride by two electrons, reforming the haem Fe(iii) centre. Characterization of the state that is generated immediately following chloride oxidation has generated much discussion27. At issue is whether OCl-is a ligand to the Fe(iii)-haem at the distal site, whether it is released from the enzyme active site or whether it is otherwise trapped within the enzyme substrate pocket but not coordinated to Fe(iii)-haem. The oxidized chlorine intermediate can then chlorinate the organic substrate or react with a second equivalent of H2O2, producing O2 (in the singlet excited state). Although caldari-omycin (Fig. 1) is not a chiral compound, interest in stereospecific and regiospecific halogenation reactions has been widespread.Figure 2 | Biologically relevant halogenation reactions.\u2002Four distinct classes of enzyme have been discovered that carry out halogenation reactions. Reaction 1, which encompasses electrophilic halogenation, is catalysed by haloperoxidases such as the haem-containing or vanadate-containing enzymes. Reaction 2 is carried out by \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haem iron halogenases and is characteristic of radical halogenation at unactivated C\u2013H centres. Reaction 3 is catalysed by flavin-dependent halogenases. Reaction 4 shows the SAM-dependent halogenase reaction. X, halogen atom; R, R\u0374, alkyl group.Figure 3 | Structure of the active site of haem CPO from C. fumago, with a bound substrate, 1,3-cyclopentanedione25. The active site of CPO contains Fe(iii)-protoporphyrin IX coordinated by the thiolate side chain of a Cys in the proximal position. Two channels have been identified that lead to the haem active site. The substrate, 1,3-cyclopentanedione (CPD), has been located in the broader of the two channels in a recent X-ray structure, and halides were located within the narrower channel25. Glu 183 is located close to the haem iron centre and is proposed to assist in formation of both compound 0 and compound I (Fig. 4). The carbon backbone is shown in teal green, oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue, sulphur in yellow and the Fe(iii) centre in orange; the dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonding. Figure 4 | Proposed catalytic cycle for haem CPOs24\u201327.\u2002The Fe(iii)-haem resting state is oxidized by H2O2, forming compound I. Compound I oxidizes chloride by two electrons, reforming the haem Fe(iii) centre and generating an oxidized chlorine intermediate that is formally at the oxidation level of OCl-. This oxidized chlorine intermediate could chlorinate the organic substrate (shown in red) or oxidize a second equivalent of H2O2 (shown in blue), depending on the reaction conditions.

EtOHOH Br OH Br Br O Br H Br O Br H V V + + a b Numerous kinetic and spectroscopic investigations along with product analyses have tried to probe the nature of the halogenating intermediate. Several experimental results suggest that the oxidized chlorine interme-diate may not escape from the active site during turnover27. A key result arising from Cl-oxidization by compound I, which is the rate-limiting step during turnover, is the 35Cl/37Cl isotope effect. During chlorination of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene or 3,5-dimethylphenol in the presence of excess chloride (with a known chlorine isotopic composition, -0.76 \u00b1 0.07\u2030), 35Cl is preferentially incorporated into the chlorinated organic products. The kinetic isotope effect, k35/k37 (the ratio of isotope reaction rate con-stants), of 1.012 for 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene or 1.011 for 3,5-dimeth-ylphenol is significantly more than that observed in the uncatalysed, molecular chlorination reaction with hypochlorite under otherwise iden-tical conditions28. The observed chloride isotope fractionation establishes that the oxidized chlorine intermediate is not in exchange equilibration with bulk Cl-, Cl2, OCl-, HOCl or other possible chlorine species outside the enzyme active site. Thus, this experiment suggests that the oxidized chlorine intermediate is trapped in the enzyme active-site pocket and that chlorination occurs within the enzyme active-site channel.Vanadium haloperoxidasesThe first vanadium haloperoxidase (V-HPO) was discovered in marine kelp in the early 1980s10,11. Since that time, vanadium bromoperoxidases (V-BPOs) have been isolated from the three major classes of marine sea-weed, and vanadium CPOs (V-CPOs) have been isolated from fungi29 and are predicted to be present in marine bacteria30. V-HPOs are undoubtedly important in the biosynthesis of many halogenated marine natural prod-ucts (see below), and have recently been shown to be involved in iodide accumulation in marine macroalgae (kelp)31. Although chlori nated natu-ral products have not been isolated from the fungi containing V-CPO, these enzymes may be important in fungus-mediated chlori nation and degradation of lignin32.The vanadate site in V-HPOs is positioned at the bottom of a channel 15\u201320 \u00c5 deep, at the core of the four-helix bundle scaffold (Fig. 5)33\u201335. Vanadium is coordinated to the protein by a single axial His ligand in a trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The three equatorial oxygens of vanadate are hydrogen-bonded to two conserved Arg residues, a Lys, a Ser and the backbone of a Gly amide, thereby decreasing the overall nega-tive charge around the vanadate ion. The proposed apical water/hydrox-ide ligand is hydrogen-bonded to a His. The X-ray structures of V-BPO (Corallina officinalis34, Ascophyllum nodosum33) and V-CPO (Curvularia inaequalis35) are remarkably similar, and are nearly superimposable when the structures are overlaid at the V(v) centre33. The striking similarity of the active sites raises questions about the molecular basis of the halide selectivity and the reactivity towards halide oxidation. One noticeable difference in the overlay is the presence of Phe 397 in V-CPO but His in V-BPO. This extra His residue does not interact directly with vanadate, although it has been proposed that the His side chain participates as a proton donor and acceptor during catalysis23,36,37 and, thus, could affect the overall oxidation potential of the oxo-peroxo-V(v) moiety.In contrast to the haem haloperoxidases that function as redox catalysts, V-HPOs function as Lewis acid catalysts of halide oxidation by H2O2. The catalytic reaction is initiated by coordination of one equivalent of H2O2 to the resting V(v) state of the enzyme (Fig. 6a). The X-ray structure of the peroxo adduct of V-CPO reveals that a Lys side chain is hydrogen-bonded to the coordinated peroxide. This is probably an essential feature of the catalytic reaction because it would increase the potential of the oxo-peroxo-V(v) centre for halide oxidation. The oxo-peroxo-V(v) species can then oxidize the halide by two electrons, forming an oxidized halogen that is formally at the X+ oxidation state or, more probably, at that of the hypohalite anion, OX-. Electrophilic halogenation results from reaction of \u2018OX-\u2019 either with the organic substrate or, in the absence of a good organic substrate, with a second equivalent of H2O2, forming O2 (which has been shown to be in the singlet excited state during turnover with Br-)38 and the halide, X-. Radical halogenation reactions have not been observed with the V-HPO enzymes.Figure 5 | Structure of the active site of V-CPO from C. inaequalis35. The V(v)-containing active site shown here for V-CPO is very similar in all the V-HPOs. A conserved His residue is a ligand to vanadate. The carbon backbone is shown in teal green, oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue and the V(v) centre in grey; the dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonding.Figure 6 | Mechanistic considerations of V-HPOs.\u2002a, Proposed catalytic cycle for V-HPOs12,21,23,37. The catalytic reaction is initiated by coordination of one equivalent of H2O2 to the resting V(v) state of the enzyme. Hydrogen bonding from a Lys side chain to V(v)-coordinated peroxide most probably assists halide oxidation by increasing the oxidation potential of the oxo-peroxo-V(v) moiety. After halide oxidation, the oxidized halogen intermediate, \u2018OX-\u2019, could brominate the organic substrate (shown in red) or oxidize a second equivalent of H2O2, forming singlet oxygen (shown in blue). b, V-BPO-catalysed formation of \u03b1-, \u03b2-and \u03b3-snyderol and (+)-3\u03b2-bromo-8-epicaparrapi oxide natural products from (E)-(+)-nerolidol41. The formation of single diastereomers of \u03b1-, \u03b2-and \u03b3-snyderol suggests that the reaction proceeds through a common intermediate, initially formed by electrophilic bromination of a single face of the terminal alkene site in (E)-(+)-nerolidol.

However, few compounds are brominated as efficiently as would be indicated by the stoichiometric consumption of one equivalent of H2O2 per brominated organic equivalent produced (Fig. 2, reaction 1). Instead, during halogenation reactions of many compounds, far more H2O2 is consumed in the halide-assisted H2O2-disproportionation reaction than brominated product is formed, consistent with escape of HOBr from the active site as occurs with poor organic substrates.Terpenes, which are the biogenic precursors to many halogenated terpene natural products, are substrates for V-BPO that do react stoi-chiometrically during turnover, such that one equivalent of H2O2 is consumed per equivalent of terpene reacted, at least with the red algal V-BPOs39\u201341. For example, V-BPO catalyses the bromination of the ses-quiterpene (E)-(+)-nerolidol, which is accompanied by terpene cycliza-tion, and consumption of one equivalent of H2O2 in the formation of \u03b1-, \u03b2-and \u03b3-snyderol and (+)-3\u03b2-bromo-8-epicaparrapi oxide (Fig. 6b)41. Single diastereomers of \u03b2-and \u03b3-snyderol and mixed diastereomers of (+)-3\u03b2-bromo-8-epicaparrapi oxide (diastereomeric excess, 20\u201325%) are produced in the V-BPO-catalysed reaction with (E)-(+)-nerolidol, whereas two diastereomers of these compounds are formed in the syn-thesis with 2,4,4,6-tetrabromocyclohexa-2,5-dienone41.The formation of single diastereomers of the snyderols in the V-BPO reaction indicates that only one face of the terminal alkene of (E)-(+)-nerolidol is brominated. Moreover, the halogenating species is trapped within the active site, although speciation within the active site, such as HOBr/OBr-/Br2, V(v)-OBr or a possible bromamine or acyl hypobromite species, among other possibilities, cannot be addressed explicitly. Thus, the active-site channel would seem to play a role by holding the terpene sub-strate in place such that only one face of the terminal alkene is presented to the vanadium centre. Differences between the active-site channels, in terms of terpene-substrate selectivity, is a topic of current interest.Recent cluster analysis of the napyradiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (nap) from the marine sediment Streptomyces sp. strain CNQ-525 and the actinomycete Streptomyces aculeolatus NRRL 18442 revealed multiple open-reading-frame sequences that could encode multiple V-CPOs and a flavin-dependent halogenase. Functional expression of the biosynthetic cluster leads to formation of chlorinated compounds (Fig. 7); however, a functional V-CPO has not yet been isolated30.Phylogenetic analysis of V-HPOs shows that the nap V-CPOs form a clade distinct from the marine algal V-BPO clade (A. nodosum, Corallina pilulifera and C. officinalis) and the fungal V-CPO clade (C. inaequalis and Embellisia didymospora)30. All of the V-HPOs have a set of conserved residues that comprise the His ligand to vanadate (His 496 in the number sequence of C. inaequalis V-CPO) and five of the other amino acids at the active site, most of which are involved in hydrogen-bonding to vanadate oxygen atoms. However, His 404, a residue that is found within hydrogen-bonding distance of the vanadate apical oxygen, is absent in the putative nap V-CPOs30. It will be interesting to learn the effects that the His 404 substitutions (Ser, Phe) have on halide oxidation reactivity.In an interesting display of chemical defence, some marine algae have evolved a means to disrupt bacterial quorum sensing and, thus, mitigate the effects of bacterial colonization of an alga\u2019s surface. Quorum sensing is the mechanism by which bacteria sense cell density and regulate such phenotypic responses as biofilm formation, virulence, swarming motility and bioluminescence. Many bacteria use acyl homoserine lactones as their signalling molecules to activate a receptor-mediated cascade of events dependent on sufficient cell density42.The lack of microbial fouling of the marine red alga Delisea pulchra has intrigued marine ecologists for some time43. Delisea pulchra produces halogenated furanones that have been shown to inhibit quorum sens-ing by interfering with the receptor-mediated phenotypic responses of certain bacteria43. Intriguingly, the 3-oxo-acyl homoserine lactones are readily susceptible to electrophilic halogenation at C2, as demonstrated by reaction with aqueous HOX/OX-/X2 as well as by the V-HPO of Lami-naria digitata (Fig. 8)44. The brominated products disrupt quorum sensing efficiently, as demonstrated with engineered reporter strains of Agrobac-terium tumefaciens and Chromobacterium violacium44. Some marine algae have haloperoxidases on their surfaces, suggesting that they use a double-pronged approach of attacking 3-oxo-acyl homoserine lactones secreted by bacteria attempting to colonize their surface, in addition to producing halogenated compounds to disrupt quorum sensing.Non-haem iron halogenasesA number of halogenated natural products, such as syringomycin E, barbamide and jamaicamide, contain halogen substituents at an unac-tivated carbon centre13,18,20,22. The biosynthesis of these compounds is catalysed by a new class of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG)-dependent, non-haem iron (FeNH) halogenase enzymes that comprise a divergent subset of the larger class of FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG oxygenases. In the oxygenase family of enzymes, the bidentate complex of \u03b1KG coordinated to Fe(ii) is bound in the enzyme active site by coordination to a conserved set of two His ligands and either an Asp or a Glu ligand that form a facial triad at the octahedral iron site. The pentadentate ligation leaves a vacant coordi-nation site for O2 coordination. Dioxygen activation is coupled to the oxidative decarboxylation of \u03b1KG, a co-substrate in the overall enzyme reaction and a source of two of the four electrons required to reduce O2 to H2O (Fig. 2, reaction 2).A distinguishing characteristic of the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenases is the absence of the carboxylate protein ligand (that is, Glu or Asp). As shown in the X-ray structure of SyrB2, which was the first FeNH halogenase to be discovered (Fig. 9)45, Fe(ii) is coordinated by the two conserved His ligands and a halide ligand. The conserved Glu/Asp residue has been replaced with Ala; this means that the (His)2(Asp/Glu) triad of the oxy-genases has been changed to (His)2(Ala), thus creating a vacancy for the halide.Figure 7 | Proposed biosynthesis of the napyradiomycins A80915A\u2013A80915D30.\u2002The sequence of reactions depicts chlorination and cyclization of the isoprene and the geranyl units in a manner analogous to V-BPO-catalysed bromination and cyclization of terpenes shown in Fig. 6b.

O\u2013 O COO\u2013 Cl\u2013 R-Cl The catalytic cycle of the halogenases (Fig. 10) resembles the reaction sequence of the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG oxygenases up to the point of formation of the oxo-ferryl species46,47. The halogenation reaction begins with asso-ciation of the organic substrate in the enzyme active site, which triggers a change in the resting state enabling the subsequent coordination of O2 by Fe(ii) in (His)2(X-)Fe(ii)NH\u2013\u03b1KG (Fig. 10)47. On the basis of the \u2018HAG\u2019 mechanism of the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG oxygenases46, Matthews et al.47 have proposed a series of states (I, II and III; Fig. 10) that lead to hydrogen-atom abstraction by the haloferryl (X\u2013Fe(iv)=O) species. The oxygen-ase and halogenase mechanisms diverge at this point. The halogenase mechanism proceeds by a rebound attack by the halogen atom at the iron centre (Fe(iii)\u2013X) on the organic radical leading to the halogenated organic compound and Fe(ii), as opposed to rebound by the hydroxyl radical (Fe(iii)\u2013OH) in the oxygenase mechanism. The hydrogen-atom abstraction step shows a large deuterium kinetic isotope effect, which has also been observed with other \u03b1KG-dependent hydroxylases47.The \u2018substrate triggering\u2019 mechanism in the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenases (Fig. 10) proposed by Matthews et al.47 is consistent with the biosyn-thesis of syringomycin E (Fig. 1), in which l-threonine is chlorinated by the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenase component, SyrB2, of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster in Pseudomonas syringae B301D (Fig. 11)48. A number of other FeNH halogenases have also been identified or predicted22, including BarB1 and BarB2 from Lyngbya majuscula, which are involved in the trichlorination of l-leucine of barbamide49; CytC3 enzymes involved in the sequential chlorination of l-aminobutyrate50; and even CmaB, which chlorinates the \u03b3 position of l-allo-isoleucine (Fig. 11), among others22,51. In this last reaction, \u03b3-Cl-l-allo-isoleucine undergoes a \u03b3-elimination reaction catalysed by the enzyme CmaC, leading to cyclopropyl ring formation and the release of chloride, a process that has been termed cryptic chlorination51.PCR cloning of halogenase homologues has been useful in the discovery of new FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenases52. Of particular interest are the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenase components, CurA and JamE, of L. majuscula, which were predicted to be involved in the biosyntheses of curacin A through cryptic halogenation52 and jamaicamide A through vinyl chloride formation53. Very recently, Gu et al.54 demonstrated the remarkable sequence identity of CurA and JamE, at 92%, yet curacin A and jamaicamide A are structurally very different. In the Cur pathway a \u03b2-branched cyclopropane is formed, whereas in the Jam pathway a vinyl chloride is formed. The evolution of these metabolic pathways within the same organism is striking. Chlorina-tion occurs at a carboxylated \u03b3-carbon in both pathways, a reaction not previously observed in other halogenases. As depicted in Fig. 12, the bio-synthetic pathways diverge after chlorination at the decarboxylation step. After formation of \u03b1,\u03b2-enoyl thioester (I \u2192 II in Fig. 12) in the Cur path-way, the NADPH-dependent Cur enoyl reductase domain was found to catalyse formation of the cyclopropyl unit, presumably by intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of Cl-. This reaction is new and distinct from the cryptic chlorination reaction catalysed by CmaB (Fig. 11d). However, in the Jam pathway a \u03b2,\u03b3-enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chlorogluta-conyl decarboxylation product is formed (I \u2192 III in Fig. 12) that is not a substrate for the Jam enoyl reductase. The Jam enoyl reductase domain is a reductase for the \u03b1,\u03b2-enoyl thioester solely, and thus is not functional in the biosynthesis of jamaicamide.Figure 9 | Structure of the active site of FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG in SyrB2 from P. syringae45.

A large class consists of the flavin-dependent halogenases (Fig. 2, reaction 2; for a current review, see ref. 18). These enzymes carry out halogenation reactions, such as in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin. Halogenation by perhydrolase enzymes has also been demonstrated, although the biologi-cal relevance of this enzyme activity is not known15.A significant class of non-metallo-halogenating enzymes use SAM as a co-substrate. The first of the SAM-dependent halogenases to be discovered was the methyl chloride transferase enzyme in seaweeds and other plants, which is responsible for the production of profuse levels of methyl chloride17,55, raising questions about its biological function. Other SAM-dependent halogenases, including chlorinase56 and fluorinase15,56\u201359 enzymes, are now known. These enzymes cata-lyse nucleophilic halogenation reactions, rather than electrophilic or radical halogenation reactions. The SAM-dependent chlorinase SalL, from the marine bacterium Salinospora tropica, chlorinates SAM by nucleophilic chloride addition generating 5\u0374-chloro-5\u0374-deoxyadenosine as a precursor to chloroethylmalonyl-CoA, which is ultimately incor-porated into salinosporamide A57. SalL will also accept Br-and I-but not F-directly. The fluorinase is the first step in the biosynthesis of fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine from the soil bacterium Strepto-myces cattleya at the C5\u0374 site of SAM in a SN2 reaction that occurs with inversion of configuration59Outlook In the past five years, more halogenating enzymes have been identified than in the four decades after the discovery of the first halogenating enzyme, haem CPO (C. fumago). The pace of discovery of new haloper-oxidases and halogenases is bound to continue to increase with the use of genomic and bioinformatic approaches. We will undoubtedly continue to isolate new halogenated natural products and uncover new biosynthetic pathways that co-opt halogenating enzymes for new purposes.However, in the four-and-a-half decades since the discovery of haem CPO, fundamental questions remain about the mechanism of the halo-genating enzymes. At first glance, the intricate balance between halo-genation and hydroxylation in the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG enzymes would seem to be mediated by the replacement of a carboxylic-acid-containing amino acid, Glu or Asp (with Ala in the halogenases), creating a vacant coordi-nation site for halide coordination to iron. But relatively few structures are known for the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenases. It is not yet known how the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG active sites vary in this class of enzyme or what the elements of discrimination and selectivity are that exist within these enzyme active sites. The 45-year-old question regarding the nature of the halogenating moiety in the haloperoxidases remains unanswered.New spectroscopic techniques able to provide faster snapshots during turnover may be revealing. With significant advances in the sensitivity of isotope mass spectrometers, investigations of halogen isotope effects may have a more prominent role in mechanistic investigations, particu-larly now for 79Br/81Br fractionation. Within the V-HPOs, elucidating the factors that control halide selection and positioning, as well as the organic substrate selectivity, will be particularly interesting. The struc-tures of the V-HPOs are fully superimposable at the V(v) centre, yet we know relatively little about the role that the active-site channel has in organic-substrate selectivity, and why some halogenated products predominate in one alga but not another related alga with a very similar haloperoxidase. In consideration of cryptic halogenation, it is not known what other natural products are formed via halogenated intermediates, including possibly in polymerization reactions.The parallel between haem, non-haem iron and flavin-dependent halogenase enzymes and haem, non-haem iron and flavin-dependent oxygenase enzymes is striking. In addition to these three types of oxy-genase enzyme, other oxygenases are also well known, including copper and manganese enzymes. Other metalloenzymes may be involved in halogenation reactions. In retrospect, it is not surprising that marine organisms evolved V-HPOs, given the halide content of the oceans and the fact that vanadium is the second most abundant transition-metal ion in seawater. Organisms living in other salty environments with unique transition-metal-ion compositions also may have evolved new metallo-enzymes that carry out halogenation reactions.

        "Halogenated natural products have been isolated in abundance from marine eukaryotic organisms, but also increasingly from microorgan-isms that inhabit marine and terrestrial environments (Fig. 1). These halogenated compounds range from peptides, polyketides, indoles, ter-penes, acetogenins and phenols to volatile halogenated hydrocarbons (for example bromoform, chloroform and dibromomethane) that are produced on a very large scale1\u20133. Many halogenated marine metabo-lites possess biological activities of pharmacological interest, including anticancer, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. The biogenesis of these compounds has intrigued scientists for",
        "decades.The first halogenating enzyme to be discovered, in the 1960s, was the haem (iron-containing porphyrin) chloroperoxidase (CPO) from the terrestrial fungus Caldariomyces fumago, which produces the chlori-nated natural product caldariomycin4. Some time later, haloperoxidase enzymes were proposed in the biogenesis of certain halogenated marine natural products5,6, although this was long before haloperoxidases or other halogenating enzymes had been discovered in marine organisms. Since the discovery of haem CPO, other haem haloperoxidases7\u20139, vanadium haloperoxidases10\u201312 and non-haem iron halogenases13, as well as non-metallo-, flavin-dependent halogenases14, SAM-dependent chlorinases and fluorinases15, and methyl halide transferases16, have been discovered. For recent reviews, see refs 14, 15,",
        "17\u201323.Haloperoxidases catalyse electrophilic halogenation reactions, whereas the non-haem iron halogenases catalyse radical halogenation reactions and SAM-dependent halogenases catalyse nucleophilic halogenation reac-tions. Haloperoxidases have traditionally been classified on the basis of the most electrophilic halide that is readily oxidized. Thus, chloroperoxi-dases oxidize chloride, bromide and iodide by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), whereas iodoperoxidases oxidize only iodide in this way. Hydrogen perox-ide lacks the thermodynamic potential to oxidize fluoride; thus, enzymes catalysing fluorination are not peroxidases. The overall stoichiometry of the haloperoxidase reaction is consumption of one equivalent of H2O2 per halogenated product produced (Fig. 2, reaction",
        "1).One class of halogenase, the non-haem iron enzymes, uses dioxygen (O2) to activate halide (Fig. 2, reaction 2); these enzymes catalyse radical halogenation reactions at aliphatic carbon sites. The overall stoichiom-etry is consumption of one equivalent of \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid and O2 per halogenated equivalent produced (Fig. 2, reaction 2). Flavin-dependent halogenases activate O2 by means of formation of flavin-bound hydroper-oxide, which then oxidizes the halide (Fig. 2, reaction 3). This class of",
        "halo-genating enzyme is a two-component system in which a flavin reductase is required to keep the halogenase reduced for catalytic turnover. These enzymes catalyse reactions that more closely resemble the electrophilic haloperoxidases that are mediated by \u2018HOX-like\u2019 species. Finally, SAM-dependent enzymes catalyse nucleophilic substitution, generating 5\u0374-halo-5\u0374-deoxyadenosine and l-methionine (Fig. 2, reaction 4). In this review we focus on the mechanisms of metalloenzyme-catalysed halogenation reactions, emphasizing the activation of halides by O2 and H2O2, and the nature of the halogenation",
        "step.In nature, halogenation is a strategy used to increase the biological activity of secondary metabolites, compounds that are often effective as drugs. However, halides are not particularly reactive unless they are activated, typically by oxidation. The pace of discovery of new enzymes for halogenation is increasing, revealing new metalloenzymes, flavoenzymes, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent enzymes and others that catalyse halide oxidation using dioxygen, hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxides, or that promote nucleophilic halide addition reactions.1Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA.Mechanistic considerations of halogenating enzymesAlison Butler1 & Moriah",

        "Haem haloperoxidasesThe fungus C. fumago, from which the first haloperoxidase, Fe(iii)-haem CPO, was derived4, produces the chlorinated natural product caldario mycin, which is thought to be synthesized by CPO. The optimal pH for chlorination turnover by haem CPO is pH 2.7 (ref. 4). Interest-ingly, CPO is used to catalyse a number of oxidation reactions in the absence of chloride. These oxidation reactions are generally carried out at neutral pH, whereas chlorination occurs only at low pH. The active site of Fe(iii)-haem CPO contains Fe(iii)-protoporphyrin IX coordi-nated by the thiolate side chain of a cysteine in the proximal position24. Recently the X-ray structure of Fe(iii)-haem CPO was determined with the substrate, 1,3-cyclopentanedione (CPD), bound in one of the two channels leading to the haem iron centre (Fig. 3)25. In addition, halide-binding sites were identified at the protein surface near the opening of the second, narrower, channel leading to the haem iron moiety, as well as within this channel and at the other end of the channel, near the haem iron",

        "Numerous kinetic and spectroscopic investigations along with product analyses have tried to probe the nature of the halogenating intermediate. Several experimental results suggest that the oxidized chlorine interme-diate may not escape from the active site during turnover27. A key result arising from Cl-oxidization by compound I, which is the rate-limiting step during turnover, is the 35Cl/37Cl isotope effect. During chlorination of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene or 3,5-dimethylphenol in the presence of excess chloride (with a known chlorine isotopic composition, -0.76 \u00b1 0.07\u2030), 35Cl is preferentially incorporated into the chlorinated organic products. The kinetic isotope effect, k35/k37 (the ratio of isotope reaction rate con-stants), of 1.012 for 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene or 1.011 for 3,5-dimeth-ylphenol is significantly more than that observed in the uncatalysed, molecular chlorination reaction with hypochlorite under otherwise iden-tical conditions28. The observed chloride isotope fractionation establishes that the oxidized chlorine intermediate is not in exchange equilibration with bulk Cl-, Cl2, OCl-, HOCl or other possible chlorine species outside the enzyme active site. Thus, this experiment suggests that the oxidized chlorine intermediate is trapped in the enzyme active-site pocket and that chlorination occurs within the enzyme active-site channel.Vanadium haloperoxidasesThe first vanadium haloperoxidase (V-HPO) was discovered in marine kelp in the early 1980s10,11. Since that time, vanadium bromoperoxidases",
        "(V-BPOs) have been isolated from the three major classes of marine sea-weed, and vanadium CPOs (V-CPOs) have been isolated from fungi29 and are predicted to be present in marine bacteria30. V-HPOs are undoubtedly important in the biosynthesis of many halogenated marine natural prod-ucts (see below), and have recently been shown to be involved in iodide accumulation in marine macroalgae (kelp)31. Although chlori nated natu-ral products have not been isolated from the fungi containing V-CPO, these enzymes may be important in fungus-mediated chlori nation and degradation of lignin32.The vanadate site in V-HPOs is positioned at the bottom of a channel 15\u201320 \u00c5 deep, at the core of the four-helix bundle scaffold (Fig. 5)33\u201335. Vanadium is coordinated to the protein by a single axial His ligand in a trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The three equatorial oxygens of vanadate are hydrogen-bonded to two conserved Arg residues, a Lys, a Ser and the backbone of a Gly amide, thereby decreasing the overall nega-tive charge around the vanadate ion. The proposed apical water/hydrox-ide ligand is hydrogen-bonded to a His. The X-ray structures of V-BPO (Corallina officinalis34, Ascophyllum nodosum33) and V-CPO (Curvularia inaequalis35) are remarkably similar, and are nearly superimposable when the structures are overlaid at the V(v) centre33. The striking similarity of the active sites raises questions about the molecular basis of the halide selectivity and the reactivity towards halide oxidation. One noticeable difference in the overlay is the presence of Phe 397 in V-CPO but His in V-BPO. This extra His residue does not interact directly with vanadate, although it has been proposed that the His side chain participates as a proton donor and acceptor during catalysis23,36,37 and, thus, could affect the overall oxidation potential of the oxo-peroxo-V(v) moiety.In contrast to the haem haloperoxidases that function as redox catalysts, V-HPOs function as Lewis acid catalysts of halide oxidation by H2O2. The catalytic reaction is initiated by coordination of one equivalent of H2O2 to the resting V(v) state of the enzyme (Fig. 6a). The X-ray structure of the peroxo adduct of V-CPO reveals that a Lys side chain is hydrogen-bonded to the coordinated peroxide. This is probably an essential feature of the catalytic reaction because it would increase the potential of the oxo-peroxo-V(v) centre for halide oxidation. The oxo-peroxo-V(v) species can then oxidize the halide by two electrons, forming an oxidized halogen that is formally at the X+ oxidation state or, more probably, at that of the hypohalite anion, OX-. Electrophilic halogenation results from reaction of \u2018OX-\u2019 either with the organic substrate or, in the absence of a good organic substrate, with a second equivalent of H2O2, forming O2 (which has been shown to be in the singlet excited state during turnover with Br-)38 and the halide, X-. Radical halogenation reactions have not been observed with the V-HPO",

The catalytic reaction is initiated by coordination of one equivalent of H2O2 to the resting V(v) state of the enzyme.

It will be interesting to learn the effects that the His 404 substitutions (Ser, Phe) have on halide oxidation reactivity.In an interesting display of chemical defence, some marine algae have evolved a means to disrupt bacterial quorum sensing and, thus, mitigate the effects of bacterial colonization of an alga\u2019s surface. Quorum sensing is the mechanism by which bacteria sense cell density and regulate such phenotypic responses as biofilm formation, virulence, swarming motility and bioluminescence. Many bacteria use acyl homoserine lactones as their signalling molecules to activate a receptor-mediated cascade of events dependent on sufficient cell density42.The lack of microbial fouling of the marine red alga Delisea pulchra has intrigued marine ecologists for some time43. Delisea pulchra produces halogenated furanones that have been shown to inhibit quorum sens-ing by interfering with the receptor-mediated phenotypic responses of certain bacteria43. Intriguingly, the 3-oxo-acyl homoserine lactones are readily susceptible to electrophilic halogenation at C2, as demonstrated by reaction with aqueous HOX/OX-/X2 as well as by the V-HPO of Lami-naria digitata (Fig. 8)44. The brominated products disrupt quorum sensing efficiently, as demonstrated with engineered reporter strains of Agrobac-terium tumefaciens and Chromobacterium violacium44. Some marine algae have haloperoxidases on their surfaces, suggesting that they use a double-pronged approach of attacking 3-oxo-acyl homoserine lactones secreted by bacteria attempting to colonize their surface, in addition to producing halogenated compounds to disrupt quorum",
        "sensing.Non-haem iron halogenasesA number of halogenated natural products, such as syringomycin E, barbamide and jamaicamide, contain halogen substituents at an unac-tivated carbon centre13,18,20,22. The biosynthesis of these compounds is catalysed by a new class of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG)-dependent, non-haem iron (FeNH) halogenase enzymes that comprise a divergent subset of the larger class of FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG oxygenases. In the oxygenase family of enzymes, the bidentate complex of \u03b1KG coordinated to Fe(ii) is bound in the enzyme active site by coordination to a conserved set of two His ligands and either an Asp or a Glu ligand that form a facial triad at the octahedral iron site. The pentadentate ligation leaves a vacant coordi-nation site for O2 coordination. Dioxygen activation is coupled to the oxidative decarboxylation of \u03b1KG, a co-substrate in the overall enzyme reaction and a source of two of the four electrons required to reduce O2 to H2O (Fig. 2, reaction 2).A distinguishing characteristic of the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenases is the absence of the carboxylate protein ligand (that is, Glu or Asp). As shown in the X-ray structure of SyrB2, which was the first FeNH halogenase to be discovered (Fig. 9)45, Fe(ii) is coordinated by the two conserved His ligands and a halide ligand.

        "The catalytic cycle of the halogenases (Fig. 10) resembles the reaction sequence of the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG oxygenases up to the point of formation of the oxo-ferryl species46,47. The halogenation reaction begins with asso-ciation of the organic substrate in the enzyme active site, which triggers a change in the resting state enabling the subsequent coordination of O2 by Fe(ii) in (His)2(X-)Fe(ii)NH\u2013\u03b1KG (Fig. 10)47. On the basis of the \u2018HAG\u2019 mechanism of the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG oxygenases46, Matthews et al.47 have proposed a series of states (I, II and III; Fig. 10) that lead to hydrogen-atom abstraction by the haloferryl (X\u2013Fe(iv)=O) species. The oxygen-ase and halogenase mechanisms diverge at this point. The halogenase mechanism proceeds by a rebound attack by the halogen atom at the iron centre (Fe(iii)\u2013X) on the organic radical leading to the halogenated organic compound and Fe(ii), as opposed to rebound by the hydroxyl radical (Fe(iii)\u2013OH) in the oxygenase mechanism. The hydrogen-atom abstraction step shows a large deuterium kinetic isotope effect, which has also been observed with other \u03b1KG-dependent",
        "hydroxylases47.The \u2018substrate triggering\u2019 mechanism in the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenases (Fig. 10) proposed by Matthews et al.47 is consistent with the biosyn-thesis of syringomycin E (Fig. 1), in which l-threonine is chlorinated by the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenase component, SyrB2, of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster in Pseudomonas syringae B301D (Fig. 11)48. A number of other FeNH halogenases have also been identified or predicted22, including BarB1 and BarB2 from Lyngbya majuscula, which are involved in the trichlorination of l-leucine of barbamide49; CytC3 enzymes involved in the sequential chlorination of l-aminobutyrate50; and even CmaB, which chlorinates the \u03b3 position of l-allo-isoleucine (Fig. 11), among others22,51. In this last reaction, \u03b3-Cl-l-allo-isoleucine undergoes a \u03b3-elimination reaction catalysed by the enzyme CmaC, leading to cyclopropyl ring formation and the release of chloride, a process that has been termed cryptic chlorination51.PCR cloning of halogenase homologues has been useful in the discovery of new FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenases52. Of particular interest are the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenase components, CurA and JamE, of L. majuscula, which were predicted to be involved in the biosyntheses of curacin A through cryptic halogenation52 and jamaicamide A through vinyl chloride formation53. Very recently, Gu et al.54 demonstrated the remarkable sequence identity of CurA and JamE, at 92%, yet curacin A and jamaicamide A are structurally very different. In the Cur pathway a \u03b2-branched cyclopropane is formed, whereas in the Jam pathway a vinyl chloride is formed. The evolution of these metabolic pathways within the same organism is striking. Chlorina-tion occurs at a carboxylated \u03b3-carbon in both pathways, a reaction not previously observed in other halogenases. As depicted in Fig. 12, the bio-synthetic pathways diverge after chlorination at the decarboxylation step. After formation of \u03b1,\u03b2-enoyl thioester (I \u2192 II in Fig. 12) in the Cur path-way, the NADPH-dependent Cur enoyl reductase domain was found to catalyse formation of the cyclopropyl unit, presumably by intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of Cl-. This reaction is new and distinct from the cryptic chlorination reaction catalysed by CmaB (Fig. 11d). However, in the Jam pathway a \u03b2,\u03b3-enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chlorogluta-conyl decarboxylation product is formed (I \u2192 III in Fig. 12) that is not a substrate for the Jam enoyl reductase. The Jam enoyl reductase domain is a reductase for the \u03b1,\u03b2-enoyl thioester solely, and thus is not functional in the biosynthesis of",

        "Non-metallo-haloperoxidases Not all biological halogenation is catalysed by metalloenzymes. A large class consists of the flavin-dependent halogenases (Fig. 2, reaction 2; for a current review, see ref. 18). These enzymes carry out halogenation reactions, such as in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin. Halogenation by perhydrolase enzymes has also been demonstrated, although the biologi-cal relevance of this enzyme activity is not",
        "known15.A significant class of non-metallo-halogenating enzymes use SAM",
        "as a co-substrate. The first of the SAM-dependent halogenases to be discovered was the methyl chloride transferase enzyme in seaweeds and other plants, which is responsible for the production of profuse levels of methyl chloride17,55, raising questions about its biological function. Other SAM-dependent halogenases, including chlorinase56 and fluorinase15,56\u201359 enzymes, are now known. These enzymes cata-lyse nucleophilic halogenation reactions, rather than electrophilic or radical halogenation reactions. The SAM-dependent chlorinase SalL, from the marine bacterium Salinospora tropica, chlorinates SAM by nucleophilic chloride addition generating 5\u0374-chloro-5\u0374-deoxyadenosine as a precursor to chloroethylmalonyl-CoA, which is ultimately incor-porated into salinosporamide A57. SalL will also accept Br-and I-but not F-directly. The fluorinase is the first step in the biosynthesis of fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine from the soil bacterium Strepto-myces cattleya at the C5\u0374 site of SAM in a SN2 reaction that occurs with inversion of",
        "configuration59Outlook In the past five years, more halogenating enzymes have been identified than in the four decades after the discovery of the first halogenating enzyme, haem CPO (C. fumago). The pace of discovery of new haloper-oxidases and halogenases is bound to continue to increase with the use of genomic and bioinformatic approaches. We will undoubtedly continue to isolate new halogenated natural products and uncover new biosynthetic pathways that co-opt halogenating enzymes for new",
        "purposes.However, in the four-and-a-half decades since the discovery of haem",
        "CPO, fundamental questions remain about the mechanism of the halo-genating enzymes. At first glance, the intricate balance between halo-genation and hydroxylation in the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG enzymes would seem to be mediated by the replacement of a carboxylic-acid-containing amino acid, Glu or Asp (with Ala in the halogenases), creating a vacant coordi-nation site for halide coordination to iron. But relatively few structures are known for the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG halogenases. It is not yet known how the FeNH\u2013\u03b1KG active sites vary in this class of enzyme or what the elements of discrimination and selectivity are that exist within these enzyme active sites. The 45-year-old question regarding the nature of the halogenating moiety in the haloperoxidases remains",
        "unanswered.New spectroscopic techniques able to provide faster snapshots during",
        "turnover may be revealing. With significant advances in the sensitivity of isotope mass spectrometers, investigations of halogen isotope effects may have a more prominent role in mechanistic investigations, particu-larly now for 79Br/81Br fractionation. Within the V-HPOs, elucidating the factors that control halide selection and positioning, as well as the organic substrate selectivity, will be particularly interesting. The",
        "struc-tures of the V-HPOs are fully superimposable at the V(v) centre, yet we know relatively little about the role that the active-site channel has in organic-substrate selectivity, and why some halogenated products predominate in one alga but not another related alga with a very similar haloperoxidase. In consideration of cryptic halogenation, it is not known what other natural products are formed via halogenated intermediates, including possibly in polymerization reactions.The parallel between haem, non-haem iron and flavin-dependent halogenase enzymes and haem, non-haem iron and flavin-dependent oxygenase enzymes is striking. In addition to these three types of oxy-genase enzyme, other oxygenases are also well known, including copper and manganese enzymes. Other metalloenzymes may be involved in halogenation reactions. In retrospect, it is not surprising that marine organisms evolved V-HPOs, given the halide content of the oceans and the fact that vanadium is the second most abundant transition-metal ion in seawater. Organisms living in other salty environments with unique transition-metal-ion compositions also may have evolved new metallo-enzymes that carry out halogenation reactions.",
