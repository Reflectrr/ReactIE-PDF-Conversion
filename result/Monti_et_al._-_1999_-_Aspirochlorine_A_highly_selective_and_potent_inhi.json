Hawserf and Khalid Islam1 * Lepetit Research Center, Via R. Lepetit 34, 21040 Gerenzano (Varese), Italy (Received for publication January 20, 1999) Aspirochlorine, a compound belonging to the gliotoxin family of compounds, exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity but its mechanism of action remains unknown. In this study we show that aspirochlorine inhibits the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans by acting on fungal protein synthesis. The compound selectively inhibits cell-free protein synthesis when using a C. albicans system, but does not inhibit this synthesis in vitro whentested with bacterial and mammaliansystems. Moreover, in intact C. albicans cells, aspirochlorine inhibits protein synthesis but does not inhibit chitin, DNA or glucan synthesis though at high concentrations some inhibition of RNAsynthesis is observed. By contrast, in intact Bacillus subtilis cells, aspirochlorine did not inhibit protein, DNA, or cell wall synthesis though it significantly inhibited RNAsynthesis. Furthermore, using heterologous systems (mammalian ribosomes and C. albicans cytosolic factors) the data suggest that the inhibitory action ofaspirochlorine is not exerted through a direct interaction with C. albicans EF-1 or EF-2. Aspirochlorine has been separately isolated from microbial fermentation broths of Aspergillus species by different groups and the structure of aspirochlorine has been determined by both NMRand X-ray crystallogra-phy, shown to be identical with that of oryzachlorine1} and A 306412~5). The compound belongs to the epi-polythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) class which consist of a large group of fungal toxins notably gliotoxin6). Gliotoxin, and several ETPs, are known to exhibit multiple activities including antifungal, antibacterial, antitumor, antiviral and immunomodulatory6~9). ETPs have been shown to inhibit viral RNA-directed RNA and DNApolymerases as well as RNAsynthesis in HeLa cells9). More recently, it has been shown that gliotoxin causes oxidative damage to plasmid and cellular DNA which may be responsible for the cytotoxic effects of the compound in eukaryotic cells10). Aspirochlorine has been shown to exhibit good activity against several yeasts1>2). In addition, the compound has pp.311 -318 been reported to be active against Staphylococcus aureus2) and to be active against newcastle disease virusX). Fur-thermore, aspirochlorine has been shown to be active against Ehrlich ascites tumor in mice, suggesting that the compound is bioavailable in vivo1]. The lethal toxicity of the compound in mice is about 100mg/kg2), which is significantly lower when compared with polyenic antifungal agents such as amphotericm B (4mg/kg). However, the mechanism of action of aspirochlorine particularly as regards its antifungal and antibacterial activity remains to be elucidated. By analogy with gliotoxin and other ETPs it is likely that aspirochlorine affects RNAor DNAto exert its antiviral and anti-tumor activity6'9*. During the course of a screening programme, aimed at isolating molecules exhibiting inhibitory activity in protein synthesis systems, we repeatedly isolated aspirochlorine from the fermentation broths of Aspergil-lus. In this paper we now show that aspirochlorine, *but Present Address: Hoechst Marion Roussel, Route De Noisy 102, Romainville Cedex, F-93235, France. 312 THE JOURNAL OF ANTIBIOTICS MAR. 1999 Fig. 1. Structure of aspirochlorine. not other mycotoxins or gliotoxin, selectively inhibits fungal protein synthesis. Moreover, aspirochlorine does not inhibit either mammalianor bacterial protein synr thesis. Additional studies suggest that aspirochlorine may inhibit fungal protein synthesis by acting on an essential cytosolic factor. An abstract of this work has recently been presented1 1}. Results Isolation and Identification A. flavus GE 49710 was identified in our screening programme as a producer of an inhibitory activity against C. albicans cell-free protein synthesis. Fermentation of this strain, isolation and structure elucidation of the active chemical entity showed that it was identical to the previously described compound aspirochlorine, also know as oryzachlorine or A-30641 (see Fig. 1). Poly(U)-Directed Poly(Phe) Synthesis The effect of aspirochlorine on the cell-free protein synthesis systems from C. albicans, E. coli and rabbit reticulocyte was examined. As shown in Figure 2, aspirochlorine exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of C. albicans cell-free synthesis with an IC50 (the amount of compound required to inhibit protein synthesis by 50%) of about llnM and complete inhibition was observed at about 100nM. By contrast, aspirochlorine failed to inhibit bacterial (E. coli) or rabbit (similar results were also obtained when using a cell-free protein synthesis system: from rat liver; see below) protein synthesis systems even at high concentrations of aspirochlorine ( > 100 jUM; Fig. 2). Anisomycin and fusidic acid, known inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synth-Fig. 2.

Purpuromycin, known to inhibit prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein synth-esis14'15), inhibited all three systems. On the other hand, three inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis, namely kirromycin, pulvomycin and MDL62,87916), efficiently inhibited the bacterial system but did not inhibit the eukaryotic protein synthesis (Table 1). Taken together, these data would suggest that aspirochlorine specifically inhibits fungal protein synthesis but does not affect bacterial or mammalianprotein synthesis. Macromolecular Syntheses In view of the observations that aspirochlorine exhibited a.selective inhibitory activity against C. albicans protein synthesis and showed good antifungal activity (MIC of 0.25/xg/ml; see also1'2)), we decided to further investigate the effects of aspirochlorine in macro-molecular syntheses using intact C. albicans cells. The time course of DNA, RNA, protein, chitin and glucan syntheses were examinedin the absence and after addition VOL. 52 NO. 3 THE JOURNAL OF ANTIBIOTICS 313 Table 1.

Buffer (O) or aspirochlorine was added 10 minutes after initiation of each reaction at final concentrations of 80,ug/ml (\u00e5 )or 200/jg/ml (V) and each reaction run for a total of 60 minutes. Control experiments (*) employed the following compounds: Nalidixic acid for DNAsynthesis, 50 /ig/ml; rifampicin for RNAsynthesis, 02 /ug/m\\; chloramphenicol for protein synthesis, 25 jug/ml; teicoplanin for cell wall synthesis, 5 jug/'ml. of aspirochlorine using appropriate precursors (see Experimental). The initial rate ofDNA, chitin and glucan synthesis in the absence of aspirochlorine was similar to that observed after the addition of aspirochlorine (see Fig. 3A, D and E), and a decrease in the syntheses was observed only at longer time-periods. By contrast, the addition of aspirochlorine resulted in a rapid inhibition of the initial rate of protein synthesis when compared to the synthesis in the absence of aspirochlorine (Fig. 3C). In addition, a reduction in RNAsynthesis was also observed (Fig. 3B), although it was not so marked as that on protein synthesis (cf. Fig. 3B and C). Aspiro-chlorine was also used in dose-dependent experiments whereby it was tested over a concentration range of 1 -100 fold its MIC on C. albicans. Typically, aspiro-chlorine efficiently inhibited the rate of protein syn-thesis at concentrations close to the MICand had no effect on the rates of synthesis of DNA,glucan or chitin at up to 100-fold the MIC, an effect on the rate of RNA synthesis was observed only at 20~40 fold the MIC. In view of the antibacterial activity of aspirochlorine we also investigated its effects on macromolecular synthesis in B. subtilis. As shown in Figure 4, aspiro-chlorine typically failed to inhibit protein, DNA or cell wall syntheses in comparison to the corresponding positive controls, namely nalidixic acid (DNA), teicopla-nin (cell wall) and chloramphenicol (protein). However, aspirochlorine did exhibit a significant inhibitory activity VOL. 52 NO. 3 THE JOURNAL OF ANTIBIOTICS 315 Fig. 5. Effect of aspirochlorine on cell free protein synthesis in reconstituted heterologous and homologous systems. Aspirochlorine was added at a final concentrations: A=0.014^m, B =0.028 ^m, C=0.278 /iM, D=2.777//m and E=21.177 fiM to the following systems: homologous C. albicans system (^) consisting of S-100 C. albicans (17 /ig) + C. albicans ribosomes (4.98 pmol); heterologous system (H) consisting ofS-100 C. albicans (17 /xg) + rat ribosomes (5 pmol). The total counts incorporated after 30 minutes incubation were determined. against bacterial RNAsynthesis (Fig. 4) indicating that its antibacterial activity in vitro maybe due to inhibition of RNAsynthesis. Reconstituted Systems We also examined the action of aspirochlorine on heterologous and homologous reconstituted systems. It is known that elongation factors (EF) EF-1 and EF-2 from C. albicans can functionally substitute those from their mammaliancounterparts1 7). However, fungal pro-tein synthesis is known to require an additional EF, namely EF-318)19). Indeed, in a heterologous recon-stituted system consisting of ribosomes from C. albicans and mammalian S-100 no poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis was observed, indicating that the ribosomes were free of EF-3. The homologous system reconstituted with C. albicans ribosomes and C. albicans S-100 ex-hibited protein synthesis activity and this activity was efficiently inhibited by 10 ~ 20 nM aspirochlorine (Fig. 5). By contrast, a heterologous system where mammalian ribosomes were reconstituted with C. albicans S-100 exhibited poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis but the synthesis was not inhibited by aspirochlorine (Fig. 5) even at high concentrations (30 fiM). The effects of gliotoxin and other mycotoxins were also examined in such systems. As shown in Fig. 6, these mycotoxins had little or no effect either in the reconstituted C. albicans system or in the heterologous system consisting of mammalian ribosomes and C. albicans S-100. Similarly, these mycotoxins failed to inhibit the reconstituted homologous mammaliansys-tem. These data would, therefore, suggest that the mycotoxins do not inhibit cell-free protein synthesis in either the fungal or the mammalian systems (Fig. 6). Discussion Aspirochlorine, a member of the ETP class of compounds, exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity but its mechanism of action has not elucidated. Our studies show that it specifically inhibits fungal protein synthesis but does not inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria 316 THE JOURNAL OF ANTIBIOTICS MAR. 1999 Fig. 6. Effects of different mycotoxins on reconstituted homologous and heterologous protein synthesis systems. The effects of the different agents (10 jig/ml) on protein synthesis were assessed in the following protein synthesis systems: (H), rat ribosomes (18 pmol) + S-100 rat; (H) rat ribosomes (18 pmol) + S-100 Candida (H^ug); (\u00bb Candida ribosomes (4.98 pmol)+S-100 Candida (17 ^g).

Inhibition of fungal protein synthesis by aspirochlorine is dose-dependent with a potent IC50 of about 10nM (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Studies on macromolecular syntheses in whole cell assays employing C. albicans and B. subtilis strongly suggest that the antifungal and antibacterial activities of aspirochlorine are attributable to the inhibition of protein (Fig. 3) and RNA synthesis (Fig. 4), respectively. We compared the ability of aspirochlorine to inhibit fungal protein synthesis with that of different com-pounds which are known to inhibit protein synthesis. For example, we used kirromycin, MDL62,879 and pulvo-mycin which specifically inhibit bacterial protein syn-thesis by interaction with EF-Tu16), anisomycin and fusidic acid which inhibit both fungal and mammalian protein synthesis12'1 3), and purpuromycin which inhibits both eukaryotic and prokaryotic protein synthesis14'1 5). In contrast to these compounds, aspirochlorine specifi-cally and selectively inhibited fungal protein synthesis (Table 1). Furthermore when compared with the other inhibitors which all exert their action in the micromolar ranges, the fungal system appears to be exquisitely sensitive to aspirochlorine with an IC50 in the nano-molar range. Moreover, this action of aspirochlorine appears to be quite different when compared with other mycotoxins and gliotoxin which do not exhibit any inhibitory activity on eukaryotic protein synthesis under these conditions (Fig. 6). It is known that protein synthesis in yeast and mammalian cells requires elongation factors, EF-1 and EF-2, and that EF-1 and EF-2 from C. albicans can functionally substitute those from their mammalian counterparts17*. Furthermore, it is also known that fungal protein synthesis also requires EF-3 which is widely distributed and highly conserved in fungi though is absent in bacteria and higher eukaryotes20). In fact, EF-3 is known to be essential for cell viability since disruption of its gene is lethal to the organism18'19*. We have exploited this information in order to further examine the putative mechanism by which aspirochlorine inhibits fungal protein synthesis. Indeed, aspirochlorine inhibited protein synthesis in a reconstituted system consisting of C. albicans ribosomes and C. albicans S-100 but failed to inhibit protein synthesis in the het-VOL.52 NO.3 THE JOURNAL OF ANTIBIOTICS erologous system consisting of mammalianribosomes and C. albicans S-100 (Fig. 5 and 6). These data would suggest that aspirochlorine does not directly affect the activities of either C. albicans EF-1 or EF-2. Preliminary studies using an aspirochlorine-resistant mutant suggest that the mechanism of resistance to aspirochlorine is probably due to a different cytosolic factor. We are currently cloning and sequencing the EF-3 gene from the resistant strain to locate any putative mutation(s) which mayconfer resistance to aspirochlorine. Experimental Materials Aspirochlorine was isolated from fermentation broths of A. flavus strain and identified by mass spectrometry and NMR(Lepetit Research Center). All radiolabelled compounds were purchased from Amershampic (UK), mycotoxins and all biochemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals used were of Analar grade. Cell Free Protein Synthesis Poly U-directed poly(Phe) synthesis was performed using an Escherichia coli S-30 fraction as described previously16). Mammalian cell free rabbit reticulocyte protein synthesis system was purchased from Promega (Promega) and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. S-30 fraction from rat liver, rat liver ribosomes and cytosolic factors, S-100, were prepared as described previously21}. Fungal cell free protein synthesis systems were prepared from C. albicans ATCC10231 15). C. albicans cells were grown in yeast nitrogen base medium (Difco) in a 50 liter fermenter to mid-log phase and harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 x g. The cells were suspended in Tris buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 10mM MgCl2, lmM DTT, 0.1mM PMSF, 0.1mM benzamidine, 10 /ig/ml leupeptin) and were disrupted in a grinding mill (Dyno-mill; type KDL, Willy A. Bachofen AGMaschinenfabrik, Basel, CH) employing three cycles of 1 minute with 2-minute cooling intervals (4\u00b0C). The cell debris and glass beads were removed by low speed centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 30,000 xg for 1 hour to obtain the S-30 fraction. S-30 fraction was used to prepare ribosomes and the S-100 cytosolic factors. E. coli poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis was per-formed as described16), using S-30. Assays were per-formed in 100/d 30mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, 10mM MgCl2, 317 80.mM NH4C1, 3mM DTT, 1him GTP, 0.8him ATP (buffer A) with 80fig poly(U), 0.6fig of phenyalanine-specific tRNA from E. coli, 17 pmol L-phenylalanine, and 6.87 pmol L-[3H]phenylalanine [specific activity 59 Ci/ mmol (1 Ci=37GBq)]. Incubation was for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0C. Protein synthesis was terminated by adding TCAto a final concentration of 5%(v/v). The samples were heated for 10 minutes at 80\u00b0C, cooled on ice and filtered on glass fibre filters using a cell-harvester (LKB). C. albicans and rat poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) syn-thesis was performed using S-30 or S-100 and ribo-somes15). Assays were performed in 100fi\\ of buffer A with 80/ig poly(U), 0.6fig of phenylalanine-specific tRNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 13.6pmol l-phenylalanine, and 10pmol L-[3H]phenylalanine [spe-cific activity 59 Ci/mmol (1 Ci=37GBq)] and treated as described above. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate BMV-directed polypeptide synthesis was performed using the commercially pur-chased Promega translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions except that a mix of all aminoacids, with the exception of phenylalanine, at a final concentration of 1 nmol and 20 pmol L-[3H]phenyl-alanine [specific activity 59Ci/mmol (l Ci=GBq)]. Incubation was for 60 minutes at 30\u00b0C. Protein synthesis was terminated by adding TCAto a final concentration of 5% (w/v). The samples were heated for 10 minutes at 80\u00b0C, cooled on ice and filtered on glass fibre filters using a cell-harvester (LKB). MinimumInhibitory Concentration (MIC) The MICsof aspirochlorine were determined against yeasts and bacteria. The MICswere read visually as the lowest concentration of compoundwhich resulted in no discernible growth as previously described22). Macromolecular Syntheses in Intact Cells The effects of aspirochlorine on macromolecular syntheses in whole bacteria and yeasts were investigated as described previously15). In brief, macromolecular syntheses in B. subtilis G498 were monitored by in-corporation of appropriate precursors: for DNA syn-thesis, [3H]-thymidine (2/^Ci/ml) with 2mg of unla-belled thymidine/liter; for RNA synthesis, [3H]-uridine (1 /iCi/ml, lOmg/liter); for cell wall synthesis, [3H]7V-acetylglucosamine (2^Gi/ml, 3.5 mg/liter); for protein synthesis, [3H]-tryptophan (1 /iCi/ml, 1 mg/liter). Mac-romolecular syntheses in C. albicans ATCC10231 em-ployed the following precursors: [3H]-adenine for DNA 318 THE JOURNAL OF ANTIBIOTICS and RNA (2//Ci/ml, with 0.1mg of unlabelled adenine/liter for DNA, and 1 /iCi/ml 2 nig/liter for RNA); [3H]-feucine for protein synthesis (5^Ci/ml); [3H]-glucose for glucan (4 /iCi/ml); [3H]7V-acetylglucosamine for chitin synthesis (4 ^Ci/ml, 1.4 mg/liter). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the appropriate precursor and after 5~ 10 minutes aspirochlorine was added and aliquots were removed at the indicated times. For dose-dependence experiments aspirochlorine was added prior to the initiation of synthesis at final concentrations ranging from 1 ~ 1,000jHg/ml. In all experiments, the reactions were stopped by the addition of cold TCAand the amount of incorporated material was determined as previously described1 5).

        "Aspirochlorine, a compound belonging to the gliotoxin family of compounds, exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity but its mechanism of action remains unknown.

It is known that elongation factors (EF) EF-1 and EF-2 from C. albicans can functionally substitute those from their mammaliancounterparts1 7).

The homologous system reconstituted with C. albicans ribosomes and C. albicans S-100 ex-hibited protein synthesis activity and this activity was efficiently inhibited by 10 ~ 20 nM aspirochlorine (Fig. 5). By contrast, a heterologous system where mammalian ribosomes were reconstituted with C. albicans S-100 exhibited poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis but the synthesis was not inhibited by aspirochlorine (Fig. 5) even at high concentrations (30 fiM). The effects of gliotoxin and other mycotoxins were also examined in such systems. As shown in Fig. 6, these mycotoxins had little or no effect either in the reconstituted C. albicans system or in the heterologous system consisting of mammalian ribosomes and C. albicans S-100. Similarly, these mycotoxins failed to inhibit the reconstituted homologous mammaliansys-tem. These data would, therefore, suggest that the mycotoxins do not inhibit cell-free protein synthesis in either the fungal or the mammalian systems (Fig. 6).",

        "employing C. albicans and B. subtilis strongly suggest that the antifungal and antibacterial activities of aspirochlorine are attributable to the inhibition of protein (Fig. 3) and RNA synthesis (Fig. 4), respectively.",
        "We compared the ability of aspirochlorine to inhibit fungal protein synthesis with that of different com-",

        "sensitive to aspirochlorine with an IC50 in the nano-molar range. Moreover, this action of aspirochlorine",
        "appears to be quite different when compared with other mycotoxins and gliotoxin which do not exhibit any inhibitory activity on eukaryotic protein synthesis under these conditions (Fig. 6).
