Halide ion methyltransferase (HMT) and halide/thiolmethyltransferase (HTMT) enzymes concerning these emissions have been purified andcharacterized from several organisms including marine algae, fungi, and higher plants; however, thecorrelation between emission profiles of methyl halides and the enzymatic properties of HMT/HTMT, and their role in vivo remains unclear.Results: Thirty-five higher plant species were screened, and high CH3I emissions and HMT/HTMTactivities were found in higher plants belonging to the Poaceae family, including wheat (Triticumaestivum L.) and paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.), as well as the Brassicaceae family, including daikonradish (Raphanus sativus). The in vivo emission of CH3I clearly correlated with HMT/HTMT activity.The emission of CH3I from the sprouting leaves of R. sativus, T. aestivum and O. sativa grownhydroponically increased with increasing concentrations of supplied iodide. A gene encoding an S-adenosylmethionine halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) was cloned from R. sativus andexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein. The recombinant R. sativus HTMT (RsHTMT) wasrevealed to possess high specificity for iodide (I-), bisulfide ([SH]-), and thiocyanate ([SCN]-) ions.Conclusion: The present findings suggest that HMT/HTMT activity is present in several familiesof higher plants including Poaceae and Brassicaceae, and is involved in the formation of methylhalides. Moreover, it was found that the emission of methyl iodide from plants was affected by theiodide concentration in the cultures. The recombinant RsHTMT demonstrated enzymaticproperties similar to those of Brassica oleracea HTMT, especially in terms of its high specificity foriodide, bisulfide, and thiocyanate ions. A survey of biogenic emissions of methyl halides stronglysuggests that the HTM/HTMT reaction is the key to understanding the biogenesis of methyl halidesand methylated sulfur compounds in nature.Published: 1 September 2009BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:116doi:10.1186/1471-2229-9-116 Received: 12 February 2009Accepted: 1 September 2009This article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/116\u00a9 2009 Itoh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methyl bromide (CH3Br) was pre-viously used as a soil fumigant, but its use is presently pro-hibited because it strongly depletes stratospheric ozone[7]. CH3Br (9 pptv in the atmosphere) [1] is also knownto originate from oceanic sources [8], terrestrial plants[9,10], and the burning of biomass [6]. Thus, CH3Cl andCH3Br are the primary carriers of natural chloride andbromide to the stratosphere, where they catalyze ozonedestruction. Compared with CH3Cl and CH3Br, whichhave long half-lives in the atmosphere of 1.0 and 0.7years, respectively [1], methyl iodide (CH3I) has a muchshorter half-life of 7-8 days [1,11]. However, methyleneiodide (CH2I2) has recently been found to affect the for-mation of marine aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei[12], and iodine oxide (IO) causes ozone loss in themarine boundary layer [13]. CH3I (5-10 pptv in oceanicair), which is the most abundant biogenic methyl halideformed by the ocean [12,13], is expected to have the sameeffects as CH2I2 and is likely to be a carrier of iodide fromthe ocean to land. Although methyl halides (CH3X) aresimple halogenated compounds that are mainly releasedfrom oceanic and terrestrial spheres as well as fromanthropogenic sources, specific information about theorigins, quantities generated, chemical and biosyntheticmechanisms, and physiological functions of methyl hali-des remains to be insufficient.Wuosmaa and Hager [14] have reported that a chloridemethyltransferase (S-adenosylmethionine: halide ionmethyltransferase, HMT) from the marine red alga Endo-cladia muricata can transfer a methyl group from S-adeno-syl-L-methionine (SAM) to a halide ion as follows:This enzyme has also been found in a variety of organismsincluding higher plants [15-18], macro/micro algae[19,20], and soil bacteria [21]. In the same manner, S-ade-nosylmethionine: halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT)catalyzes the formation of methanethiol (CH3SH) andmethyl thiocyanate (CH3SCN) in the presence of thebisulfide ion ([SH]-) or thiocyanate ion ([SCN]-) as fol-lows [22-24]:CH3Cl emissions have been reported from specific tropi-cal plants, including certain types of fern, members of thefamily Dipterocarpaceae [2] and salt marsh plants [3]. Onthe other hand, CH3I emissions have been reported frommarine algae, such as E. muricata, Papenfusiella kuromo,and Sargassum horneri (macroalgae) [14,19], Pavlova sp.(microalgae) [20], and various soil microorganisms [21].Therefore, it can be speculated that different types ofHMT/HTMT may be present in these organisms.HMT and HTMT genes have been cloned from severalhigher plants including Batis maritima (BmMCT) [16,17],Brassica oleracea (BoTMT1 and BoTMT2) [25], and Arabi-dopsis thaliana (AtHOL) [18]. Their functions in theseplants have been speculated to include salt-tolerance viathe emission of methyl halides [15,16], and detoxificationof sulfur compounds produced from the degradation ofglucosinolates [24], although their precise roles in vivoremain unclear due to the lack of information availableregarding these enzymes.In this study, the extractable HMT/HTMT activity wasmeasured in several agricultural plants as well as coastaltrees and grasses. High HMT/MTMT activity was found inspecific plants including Raphanus sativus (daikon radish),O. sativa (paddy rice), T. aestivum (wheat), and Cyathealepifera (fern). Moreover, the gene encoding HTMT wasisolated from R. sativus and expressed in Escherichia coli.This paper reports the emission profiles of methyl halidesfrom some plants and the characterization of the enzy-matic properties of recombinant R. sativus HTMT(RsHTMT). Results and discussionDistribution of HMT/HTMT activity in higher plantsTo examine the distribution of HMT/HTMT activity inhigher plants, HMT activity in crude extracts from 35higher plants were assayed using the iodide ions (I-).Iodide is the most readily methylated ion among HMT/HTMT substrates. As shown in Table 1, the HMT activitywas evaluated in several major agricultural plants, includ-ing T. aestivum (wheat), O. sativa (paddy rice), Zea mays(maize), and Saccharum sp. (sugar cane) from the Poaceaefamily, R. sativus and Brassica napus L. (rapeseed) from theBrassicaceae family, and Basella alba 'Rubra' (B. rubra)from the Basellaceae family. Trace activities of less than 1U (detection limit) were observed in a few coastal plantsincluding Arundo donax L. (Poaceae), Artemisia fukudo, andSuaeda maritima (Table 1). Saini et al. [26] reported intheir survey of methyl halides in higher plants that B.napus and R. sativus (Brassicaceae) have high in vivo HMTactivity, B. rubra has medium activity, and Z. mays has lowactivity. The data obtained in the present study were sim-ilar to those reported by Saini et al., except that in thepresent study, Glaux maritima showed no methyl halideemissions. The present report is the first description ofHMT activity in T. aestivum L. (wheat), which is a majorcrop species belonging to the Poaceae family.

In addition, it was found that the CH3Cl-producing fern Cyathea lepifera [2] possessed HMT activ-ity. Leaves of young R. sativus seedlings (3-5 days old) exhib-ited the highest HTMT activity (ca. 3,600 U/g fresh leaves)among the plants tested. The enzymatic properties of theHTMT enzyme in R. sativus have not yet been investigated;therefore, R. sativus leaves were used for further enzymaticexperiments. The HTMT activity of R. sativus was primarilylocalized in the leaves, with activity in the stem and youngroots much weaker, and no activity detected in the matureR. sativus root. In contrast, a similar level of HTMT activitywas detected in B. campestris L. (rapifera group) roots com-pared with leaves. Attieh et al. [25] have reported thatstronger thiol methyltransferase activity was observed inleaves than stems and roots in young seedlings and muchweaker activity was found in mature plants in cabbage (B.oleracea). On the other hand, AtHOL1 of A. thaliana,which is a homologous gene of BoTMT1 in B. oleracea, isubiquitously expressed during growth and AtHOL3 ishighly expressed in roots of mature plants [27]. Thesefindings suggest that R. sativus has a unique activity profileof HTMT compared with other Brassicaceae plants.Table 1: HMT/HTMT activities in selected higher plants.Plant Activity (U/g fresh tissue)*Agricultural plantsFamily BrassicaceaeBrassica campestris (rapifera group; leaf)**1,700 Brassica campestris L.

(daikon radish) were cultured hydroponically from seeds. In the case of Saccharum sp.(sugar cane), cut stems were cultured in soil. Other plants examined in the survey of HMT/HTMT activity were collected from the Himi Seaside Botanical Garden (Himi, Toyama, Japan) or supplied by local farmers. HMT/HTMT activity was assayed with the crude extracts prepared from each plant tissue. No activity was observed in the following plants (the extracts were obtained from leaf samples, unless otherwise indicated): agricultural plants: Allium sativum L.

These plants were culturedhydroponically to avoid the effect of soil microorganisms.No CH3I emissions were detected in the absence of I-;however, the emission levels rose in response to increas-ing concentrations of iodide ions ranging from 1 mM to 5mM. This indicates that free I-in water are crucial for theformation of CH3I, and that CH3I emission is affected byiodide concentration. In vivo production of CH3I wasobserved from T. aestivum, O. sativa and R. sativus when I-were supplied and the formation of CH3SH and dimethylsulfide (DMS) was always detected in GC-MS analyses(Figure 2) in the absence of halide ions. This data concurswith the previous reports by Fall et al. [28] and Kanda etal. [29,30] of the emission of sulfur-containing gasesincluding DMS from maize, wheat, and rice.The worldwide areas of rice and wheat cultivation areapproximately 140-150 \u00d7 106 and 210-220 \u00d7 106 ha,respectively. It is therefore important to evaluate the levelof emissions of volatile compounds, such as methyl hali-des, from these plants and to clarify the mechanism ofsynthesis of these compounds. The emission rates of CH3Ifrom these plants in the presence of 5 mM iodide were 0.4(T. aestivum), 3.1 (O. sativa), and 30.8 \u03bcg/g fresh leaf perday (R. sativus), and correlated with the observed HMT/HTMT activities (T. aestivum, 210; O. sativa, 120; R. sativus,3,600 U/g fresh leaf). The results of this study confirm thatmethyl halide emissions from rice and wheat plants aredependent on HMT/HTMT activity. The slight differencesbetween the emission rates of T. aestivum, O. sativa, and R.sativus and their HMT/HTMT activities are probably due tothe specific properties of the HMT/HTMT in these plants,especially their Km values towards I-. Saini et al. [26] havereported that CH3I emission from leaf disks of B. oleraceawas 168.3 \u03bcg/g fresh leaf per day in the presence of 50 mMiodide. This value is comparable with that obtained for R.sativus in this study, although the experimental conditionsbetween the studies differed.In vivo emission of CH3Cl or CH3Br from R. sativus wasobserved when plants were supplemented with Cl-or Br-,and CH3Cl or CH3Br was detected in the in vitro reactionsusing the crude enzyme preparation (Table 2). However,no emissions of CH3Cl or CH3Br from T. aestivum and O.sativa were observed in vivo or in vitro due to the low lev-els of HMT activity in these plants. Muramatsu and Yosh-ida [31] first confirmed the emission of CH3I from ricepaddies, and Redeker et al. [32] also detected emissions ofmethyl halides, mainly CH3I, from the same ecosysteminvolving soil, soil microorganisms, and rice plants. Morerecently, Redeker et al. [33] analyzed the methyl halideemissions from rice plants in more detail. A hydroponicsystem was adopted in the present study so that emissionsreflected those of the tested plants alone, and were notaffected by the presence of soil microorganisms. Theresults of the present study, together with the report of anHMT homologue in rice [18], indicate that rice plants pro-duce CH3I through an HMT/HTMT reaction, and soilmicroorganisms mainly play a role in liberating I-fromthe soil, where it is present as iodate (IO3 -). The meanconcentration of iodide in field soil ranges from 5 to 20mg/kg in dry soil, and around 2 mg/kg dry soil in paddysoil [31]. This difference is explained by an increase in thereductive conditions of the paddy when flooded.

Therefore, the existence ofHTMT isoforms in R. sativus was examined using partialenzyme purification by chromatography. As shown in Fig-ure 3, one major bell-shaped HTMT activity peak wasobserved on the chromatogram, and most of the activityin the crude extract was recovered in this peak. This resultindicates that the sprouting leaves of R. sativus produceone major HTMT isoform. Using the crude enzyme prep-aration of HTMT, the substrate specificity towards anionswas measured, and compared with that of B. oleracea. Asshown in Table 2, the enzyme from R. sativus exhibited thehighest activity towards [SH]-and I-, whereas the activitiestoward Br-and Cl-were much lower. The substrate spec-trum of HTMT was consistent with the in vivo emissionrates of methyl halides.Attieh et al. [15,23] reported that HTMT from B. oleracea,which belongs to the same family as R. sativus (Brassi-caceae), is able to methylate I-as well as (NH4)2S ([SH]-)and [SCN]-. Because (NH4)2S and NaSH ([SH]-) reactchemically with SAM to produce small amounts ofCH3SH and/or DMS, the enzymatic formation of theseproducts was analyzed carefully. It was confirmed that theGC-MS analysis of methyl halides, methanethiol, and DMS from R. sativusFigure2 GC-MS analysis of methyl halides, methanethiol, and DMS from R. sativus.

However, this activitywas weak towards (NH4)2S (Table 2). This discrepancybetween the present and previous data [15,23] could bedue to differences in the experimental conditions.(NH4)2S is not a good substrate to measure the formationof CH3SH by HTMTs. In order to measure CH3SCN orCH3CN production by HTMT with KSCN or KCN as sub-strates, the reaction mixture was measured directly by GC-14A gas chromatography because most of the CH3SCN orCH3CN was dissolved in water and did not transfer intothe gaseous phase. It was found that most of the CH3SCNproduced by the HTMT reaction in R. sativus was con-verted to CH3SH by an unknown chemical reaction cata-lyzed by a protein (Table 2). In addition, it was confirmedthat R. sativus exhibited methionine \u03b3-lyase activity thatproduces CH3SH from methionine. These results indicatethat CH3SH is possibly produced through several path-ways in R. sativus. However, DMS production could not bedetected with the HTMT reaction from SH-and SAM.Rhew et al. [18] have reported that the emission of methylhalides by A. thaliana is inhibited by the addition of[SCN]-. The authors speculated that methyl halide emis-sions were competitively inhibited by [SCN]-because thision is the preferred substrate for HTMT in A. thaliana.Cloning and sequence analysis of an HTMT coding gene from R. sativusTo investigate the properties of HTMT in R. sativus, a fulllength HTMT-encoding gene (Rshtmt) was isolated.Degenerate PCR was performed to isolate a partialsequence of Rshtmt using total RNA prepared from sprout-ing leaves of R. sativus as a template. The PCR product gavea single fragment of 300 bp in size. The fragment wascloned into a pTA2 vector and the nucleotide sequence ofthe insert was determined. The amino acid sequencededuced from the nucleotide sequence indicated highsimilarity to HMT/HTMT genes of higher plants. In orderto isolate the full length Rshtmt sequence, 3'/5'-RACE wasperformed using several primers designed with referenceto this nucleotide sequence, and a single open readingframe (ORF) that encoded a HTMT was detected in theanalyzed nucleotide sequence. The full length nucleotidesequences of the cDNA and genomic DNA containingRshtmt were obtained by PCR amplification using specificprimers. A comparison of the cDNA and genomic sequencesrevealed that the Rshtmt ORF contains 7 introns. Rshtmtencodes a protein of 226 amino acid residues, and thededuced amino acid sequence showed a significant simi-larity to those of higher plant HMTs/HTMTs, whichbelong to family 11 of the methyltransferase superfamily,including B. oleracea BoTMT1 (GenBank: AF387791,94.2% identity), A. thaliana AtHOL1 (GenBank:NP181919, 80.2%), B. maritima BmMCT (GenBank:Table 2: Substrate specificity of HTMT from R. sativus.Anion (mM)Production rate of methyl compounds (pmol/min/mg protein)Raphanus sativusBrassica oleraceaCl--(20) N.D. *--(50) 6 --Br--(20) 79 --(50) 234 --I--(20) 3,094 2,685 (50) 5,552 --[SH]-((NH4)2S) (20)339 267 [SH]-(NaSH) (20)6,428 4,456 [SCN]-(20)1,028 **645 **[CN]-(20)N.D. *N.D. **N.D., not detected.** Measured from the amount of CH3SH converted from CH3SCN in the gaseous phase; the amount of CH3SCN in the liquid phase was negligible.DEAE anion exchange chromatography of HTMT from R. sativusFigure 3DEAE anion exchange chromatography of HTMT from R. sativus.

The deducedamino acid sequence of Rshtmt contains several motifsand a secondary structure that is conserved among the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases[34-37]. The results indicate that the cloned Rshtmtbelongs to the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent meth-yltransferase (SAM-MT) family. The prototypical SAM-MTfold is constructed of seven \u03b2 strands (\u03b21-\u03b27) and six \u03b1helices (\u03b1Z and \u03b1A-\u03b1E) [37], although the \u03b27 strand ofRsHTMT is replaced by an \u03b1 helix. Such structural differ-ences might contribute to the substrate specificity ofRsHTMT. Enzymatic properties of recombinant RsHTMTTo obtain recombinant RsHTMT, Rshtmt was introducedinto E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the expression vector pET-21b. The recombinant RsHTMT was expressed as a histi-dine-(His-) tagged soluble protein in E. coli cells and puri-fied by Ni-Sepharose resin column chromatography. Thepurified RsHTMT appeared homogenous, as judged bySDS-PAGE, and its molecular mass was estimated to be 29kDa (Figure 4). This value is close to the molecular massof 27.5 kDa predicted from the amino acid sequence ofRshtmt including the His-tag. The purified protein wascharacterized and its substrate specificity was determined.The Km values of recombinant RsHTMT for Cl-, Br-, I-, [SH]-, [SCN]-and SAM were 1656.40 mM, 177.34 mM, 4.47mM, 12.24 mM, 0.04 mM, and 0.19 mM, respectively, asshown in Table 3. The enzyme showed no activity towardsCN-. Saini et al. [28] reported Km values for Cl-, Br-, I-, [SH]-, and SAM of B. oleracea thiol methyltransferase of 85 mM,29 mM, 1.3 mM, 4.7 mM, and 0.03 mM, respectively. Thevalues obtained for RsHTMT were therefore similar to B.oleracea thiol methyltransferase in terms of methyl accep-tor preference: high specificity for I-, [SH]-, and [SCN]-,and low specificity for Cl-and Br-. Purified RsHTMTshowed a high specificity for [SCN]-, although muchlower activity was found when a crude extract was used toassay the enzyme activity (Table 2). This discrepancycould be due to the existence of other proteins in thecrude extract; however, the precise reason remainsunclear. It is known that many enzymes are inhibited inthe presence of high concentration of anions, such asbisulfide, thiocyanide, and halide ions [38-41]. Attieh etal. [25] reported that the expression pattern of thiol meth-yltransferases of B. oleracea corresponds to the concentra-tion of glucosinolate. This suggests that RsHTMT in R.sativus may be involved in the detoxification of sulfurcompounds produced by the degradation of glucosi-nolates to release them as volatile compounds. The vola-tile sulfur compounds, including CH3SH and CH3SCNand methyl halides, are believed to act as insecticidal oranti-pathogenic agents. Therefore, it is speculated thatRsHTMT in R. sativus plays a role in controlling the levelsof anions that can inhibit metabolic enzymes in the leavesand also to protect them from damage caused by insectsor pathogens.Conclusion It was found that there is high HMT/HTMT activity in thesprouting leaves of R. sativus (daikon radish), T. aestivum(wheat), and O. sativa (paddy rice). HMT/HTMT activitywas responsible for in vivo CH3I emissions from theseagricultural plants. The Rshtmt gene was cloned success-fully and expressed in E. coli cells. The activity data frompurified RsHTMT suggest that RsHTMT may participate insulfur metabolism in sprouting leaves of R. sativus. TheHMT/HTMT reaction was found to be involved in theemission of methyl halides or volatile sulfur compoundsfrom higher plants and is key to our understanding of thebiogenesis of these compounds in nature.Table 3: Kinetic parameters of purified recombinant RsHTMT.Substrate Km (mM)Vmax (pmol/min/mg)Vmax/Km SAM 0.19 ----Cl-1657.40 3,381 2.04 Br-177.34 34,965 1.97 \u00d7 102I-4.47 139,286 3.12 \u00d7 104[SH]-(NaSH)12.24 158,732 1.30 \u00d7 104[SCN]-0.04 185,185 4.41 \u00d7 106Kinetic parameters for SAM were measured at a constant iodide concentration (20 mM).

Seeds were placed on cot-ton matrices supplemented with modified Hoagland'ssolution: 1 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM KNO3, 5 mMCa(NO3)2.4H2O, 0.3 \u03bcM CuSO4.5H2O, 2 mMMgSO4.7H2O, 46 \u03bcM H3BO3, 24 \u03bcM Ferric-NaEDTA, 9\u03bcM MnSO4.H2O, 0.1 \u03bcM NH4MoO4.4H2O, 0.7 \u03bcMZnSO4.7H2O (pH 5.7). In the case of Saccharum sp. (sugarcane), cut stems were disinfected and placed in a pot withsoil and cultured. Plants were grown at 20\u00b0C and 40 \u03bcE/m2/s (12 h light; 12 h dark) for R. sativus, T. asetivum andB. napus, and at 30\u00b0C and 133 \u03bcE/m2/s for O. sativa, Z.mays and Saccharum sp. between 4 and 15 days untilenough leaves or blades were obtained.Plant seeds (JP strains; Table 1) including rice, wheat,daikon radish and rapeseed and stems of sugar cane weresupplied by the National Institute of Agrobiological Sci-ences (NIAS), Tsukuba, Japan. Other plants examined inthe survey of HMT/HTMT activity were collected from theHimi Seaside Botanical Garden (Himi, Toyama, Japan) orsupplied by local farmers.Crude enzyme preparations from plantsPlant tissue (1-2 g wet weight) containing mainly leaveswas ground using sea sand (40-80 mesh) in a mortar andpestle at 4\u00b0C, and then extracted with 20 mM MES buffer(pH 7.0) containing 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at a ratioof 0.1 g sample/0.5 ml buffer. The crude extract was cen-trifuged at 4\u00b0C for 30 min at 10,000 \u00d7 g to obtain thesupernatant. In the case of R. sativus, the supernatant wasfiltered prior to measuring CH3SH and DMS levels usingan Econo-Pac 10DG gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) toeliminate endogenous CH3SH and DMS.Measurement of HMT/HTMT activityThe formation of methyl halides, CH3SH, and DMS wasassayed using a Shimadzu QP-2010 gas chromatographer-mass spectrometer (GC-MS; quadrupole) equipped with aTurboMatrix HS40 head space sampler (Perkin Elmer).The enzyme solution was incubated in a 5 ml mixturecontaining 0.5 mM SAM, 20 or 50 mM halides (KX), or 20mM (NH4)2S (pH 7.0); or NaSH for bisulfide methyla-tion, and 20 mM MES (pH 7.0). Enzyme reactions werestarted by the addition of 0.2-1.0 ml of enzyme solution.The mixture was incubated in a 22-ml vial sealed using asilicon septum, followed by shaking at 170 rpm at 30\u00b0Cfor 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heating at 70\u00b0Cfor 5 min in a water bath. Each sample vial was then con-nected to the head space sampler and automatically heldat 70\u00b0C for 20 min to transfer volatile compounds intothe gaseous phase. The gas phase was drawn for 0.2 minafter pressuring the tube for 3 min at 70\u00b0C to carry thesample gas into the GC-MS inlet. The temperature of thetransfer line and syringe was maintained at 90\u00b0C. Thehead space gas was injected into a DB-VRX capillary col-umn (J & W Scientific; 60 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d., 1.4 \u03bcm filmthickness) for GC-MS analysis. The carrier gas (He) flowrate was 3.9 ml/min (100 kPa), and the linear velocity ofthe capillary column was 23.6 cm/s. Samples wereinjected automatically in splitless mode for 1 min at180\u00b0C with the following column temperature program:40\u00b0C for 5 min, 2\u00b0C/min increases to 50\u00b0C, and then10\u00b0C/min increases to 180\u00b0C. Mass spectra wereobtained at 70 eV using an electron-impact ion source (EI,200\u00b0C). The retention times of CH3Cl, CH3Br, CH3I,CH3SH, and DMS were 5.05, 6.20, 9.00, 5.85, and 8.90min, respectively. The products were quantified by peakarea and identified by comparison with the retentiontimes and molecular ions (m/z) of methyl halide, CH3SH,and DMS standards.The formation of CH3SCN and CH3CN in the reactionmixture was measured by GC-14A gas chromatography(Shimadzu) using a flame ionization detector. Theenzyme solution (50 \u03bcl) was added to a solution contain-ing 0.5 mM SAM, 20 mM KSCN or KCN, and 20 mM MES(pH 7.0) in a total volume of 1 ml. After incubation at 170rpm at 30\u00b0C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by heat-ing at 70\u00b0C for 5 min. A 5 \u03bcl aliquot of the reaction mix-ture was injected directly into a packed column (2.1 m \u00d73.2 mm) of Thermon1000/ShimaliteW (Shimadzu GLCInc.; column T, 80\u00b0C; injection T, 140\u00b0C; detection T,150\u00b0C; flow rate, 40 ml/min of N2) by GC. The retentiontimes of CH3CN and CH3SCN were 1.48 and 4.48 min,respectively, and the products were quantified using thepeak area.To calibrate the concentrations of the products, gas andliquid standards of CH3I, DMS, and CH3SCN were pre-pared. The detection limits of the GC-MS analysis formethyl halides, CH3SH, and DMS were around 0.03 ppmin the gaseous phase, and that of the GC-14A for CH3SCNwas 0.05 mM (3.66 ppm) in the liquid phase. The totalamount of each product, except for CH3SCN and CH3CN,was calculated from the concentration of the gas phase,assuming that the equilibrium of each compound in airand water in a vial was attained. One unit (U) of enzymeactivity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that cat-alyzed the formation of 1 pmol of methyl halides, CH3SH,or CH3SCN in one min at 30\u00b0C.Partial purification of HTMT from the sprouting leaves of R. sativusThe following procedures for purifying HTMT were all car-ried out at 4\u00b0C unless stated otherwise. The sproutingPage 8 of 10(page number not for citation BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:116http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/116 leaves of R. sativus were collected (10 g wet weight),ground using a mortar and pestle with sea sand (40-80mesh), and extracted with 10 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.5) supplemented with 5 mM DTT. In order to removephenolic compounds, 10% (w/v) polyvinyl polypyrro-lidone was added to the recovered supernatant. After cen-trifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min, the supernatant wasdialyzed with Tris-HCl buffer containing 5 mM DTT. Theenzyme solution was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 Manion exchange column (28 \u00d7 45 mm, Tosoh Corp.,Tokyo, Japan), which had been equilibrated with theabove buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a 0-0.3 M NaCllinear gradient in buffer (total 400 ml). The HTMT activitywas measured for all fractions obtained. The protein con-centration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at280 nm or using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (SigmaAldrich) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the stand-ard protein in accordance with the manufacturer's proto-col. Strains and vectors for genetic manipulationR. sativus was used as a source of chromosomal DNA andtotal RNA for the isolation of the Rshtmt gene. E. coliJM109 cells and plasmid vector pTA2 were used in DNAmanipulation. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and expression vec-tor pET-21b were used to express the recombinantRsHTMT in E. coli.Cloning of the HTMT coding gene from R. sativusStandard techniques were used for DNA manipulation[42]. Genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated from thesprouting leaves of R. sativus grown on Hoagland's solu-tion for 4 days. Genomic DNA was prepared by themethod of Dellaporta et al. [43]. Total RNA was isolatedusing an RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to themanufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was synthe-sized using a PrimeScript High Fidelity RT-PCR kit(TaKaRa) with an oligo dT primer, and the products wereused as PCR templates. A set of degenerate oligonucle-otide primers (sense primer, 5'-CTKGTMCCCGGMTGT-GGY-3'; antisense primer, 5'-SAGRGTKATGAGYTCKCCRTC-3') were designed on thebasis of partial amino acid sequences conserved amongthe higher plant thiol methyltransferase-and HMT-codinggenes. In order to obtain the nucleotide sequences of the3'-and 5'-ends of the HMT-coding cDNA, 3'-and 5'-rapidamplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was carried out using3'/5'-Full RACE Core Set (TaKaRa) with first strand cDNAas a template. The whole genomic and cDNA fragments ofRshtmt were amplified by PCR using primers designedfrom the nucleotide sequence of the N-and C-termini.The nucleotide sequence of Rshtmt was determined usinga capillary DNA sequencer 310 (Applied Biosystems) andwas deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ)database under accession no. AB477013.Expression and purification of recombinant RsHTMTThe Rshtmt cDNA corresponding to the mature HTMTsequence was amplified by PCR using two oligonucle-otide primers (sense primer, 5'-CCATGGATCCAATGGCT-GAGGGACAACA-3', BamHI site in italics; antisenseprimer, 5'-GTCGACTTAAAGCTTGTTGATCTTTTTCCAC-CTACC-3', HindIII site in italics). The amplified fragmentwas digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into theexpression vector pET-21b treated with the same restric-tion enzymes. The resulting plasmid encoding a His-tagged translational fusion of RhHTMT was named pET-Rshtmt and was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Trans-formants were grown on LB medium containing 50 \u03bcg/mlampicillin to OD600 0.4 at 37\u00b0C with shaking. Isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concen-tration of 1 mM to induce expression of the recombinantprotein, and cells were incubated for a further 4 hours.The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resus-pended in cell lysis buffer (20 mM MES, 0.5 M NaCl, 5mM DTT, and 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.0). The cell suspen-sion was sonicated five times for 30 s each and centrifugedat 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was loadedonto a Ni-Sepharose\u2122 high performance column (1 mlbed volume). The column was washed with 10 ml of celllysis buffer and recombinant RsHTMT fused to the His-tagwas eluted using elution buffer (20 mM MES, 0.5 M NaCl,5 mM DTT, and 0.5 M imidazole, pH 7.0). Eluted frac-tions containing recombinant RsHTMT were desaltedusing an Econo-pac column with 20 mM MES buffer (pH7.0) containing 5 mM DTT. The solution obtained wasanalyzed to determine the protein concentration andretained for further experiments.Chemicals S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) was obtained fromSigma. Gases containing CH3Cl, CH3Br, and CH3I (1 or 5ppm in N2) were specially prepared by Sumitomo SeikaCo., Osaka, Japan, and gases containing CH3SH and DMS(1 and 5 ppm in N2) were obtained from TakachihoChemical Industrial Co., Tokyo.Abbreviations HMT: S-adenosyl-L-methionine; halide ion methyltrans-ferase; HTMT: S-adenosyl-L-methionine: halide/thiolmethyltransferase; SAM: S-adenosyl-L-methionine; SAH:S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine; DMS: dimethyl sulphide.Authors' contributionsMM, TT, and NO carried out analysis of the emission pro-file of methyl halides from higher plants and partial puri-fication of native HTMT from R. sativus.

        "Abstract Background: Biogenic emissions of methyl halides (CH3Cl, CH3Br and CH3I) are the majorsource of these compounds in the atmosphere; however, there are few reports about the halideprofiles and strengths of these emissions. Halide ion methyltransferase (HMT) and halide/thiolmethyltransferase (HTMT) enzymes concerning these emissions have been purified andcharacterized from several organisms including marine algae, fungi, and higher plants; however, thecorrelation between emission profiles of methyl halides and the enzymatic properties of HMT/HTMT, and their role in vivo remains unclear.Results: Thirty-five higher plant species were screened, and high CH3I emissions and HMT/HTMTactivities were found in higher plants belonging to the Poaceae family, including wheat (Triticumaestivum L.) and paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.), as well as the Brassicaceae family, including daikonradish (Raphanus sativus). The in vivo emission of CH3I clearly correlated with HMT/HTMT activity.The emission of CH3I from the sprouting leaves of R. sativus, T. aestivum and O. sativa grownhydroponically increased with increasing concentrations of supplied iodide. A gene encoding an S-adenosylmethionine halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) was cloned from R. sativus andexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein. The recombinant R. sativus HTMT (RsHTMT) wasrevealed to possess high specificity for iodide (I-), bisulfide ([SH]-), and thiocyanate ([SCN]-) ions.Conclusion: The present findings suggest that HMT/HTMT activity is present in several familiesof higher plants including Poaceae and Brassicaceae, and is involved in the formation of methylhalides. Moreover, it was found that the emission of methyl iodide from plants was affected by theiodide concentration in the cultures. The recombinant RsHTMT demonstrated enzymaticproperties similar to those of Brassica oleracea HTMT, especially in terms of its high specificity foriodide, bisulfide, and thiocyanate ions. A survey of biogenic emissions of methyl halides stronglysuggests that the HTM/HTMT reaction is the key to understanding the biogenesis of methyl halidesand methylated sulfur compounds in",

        "Background Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) exists in the atmosphere in largequantities (550 parts per trillion by volume, pptv) [1] dueto its release from specific plants [2-4], fungi [5], and theburning of biomass [6]. Methyl bromide (CH3Br) was pre-viously used as a soil fumigant, but its use is presently pro-hibited because it strongly depletes stratospheric ozone[7]. CH3Br (9 pptv in the atmosphere) [1] is also knownto originate from oceanic sources [8], terrestrial plants[9,10], and the burning of biomass [6]. Thus, CH3Cl andCH3Br are the primary carriers of natural chloride andbromide to the stratosphere, where they catalyze ozonedestruction. Compared with CH3Cl and CH3Br, whichhave long half-lives in the atmosphere of 1.0 and 0.7years, respectively [1], methyl iodide (CH3I) has a muchshorter half-life of 7-8 days [1,11]. However, methyleneiodide (CH2I2) has recently been found to affect the for-mation of marine aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei[12], and iodine oxide (IO) causes ozone loss in themarine boundary layer [13]. CH3I (5-10 pptv in oceanicair), which is the most abundant biogenic methyl halideformed by the ocean [12,13], is expected to have the sameeffects as CH2I2 and is likely to be a carrier of iodide fromthe ocean to land. Although methyl halides (CH3X) aresimple halogenated compounds that are mainly releasedfrom oceanic and terrestrial spheres as well as fromanthropogenic sources, specific information about theorigins, quantities generated, chemical and biosyntheticmechanisms, and physiological functions of methyl hali-des remains to be",

As shown in Table 1, the HMT activitywas evaluated in several major agricultural plants, includ-ing T. aestivum (wheat), O. sativa (paddy rice), Zea mays(maize), and Saccharum sp. (sugar cane) from the Poaceaefamily, R. sativus and Brassica napus L. (rapeseed) from theBrassicaceae family, and Basella alba 'Rubra' (B. rubra)from the Basellaceae family. Trace activities of less than 1U (detection limit) were observed in a few coastal plantsincluding Arundo donax L. (Poaceae), Artemisia fukudo, andSuaeda maritima (Table 1). Saini et al. [26] reported intheir survey of methyl halides in higher plants that B.napus and R. sativus (Brassicaceae) have high in vivo HMTactivity, B. rubra has medium activity, and Z. mays has lowactivity. The data obtained in the present study were sim-ilar to those reported by Saini et al., except that in thepresent study, Glaux maritima showed no methyl halideemissions.

The enzymatic properties of theHTMT enzyme in R. sativus have not yet been investigated;therefore, R. sativus leaves were used for further enzymaticexperiments. The HTMT activity of R. sativus was primarilylocalized in the leaves, with activity in the stem and youngroots much weaker, and no activity detected in the matureR. sativus root. In contrast, a similar level of HTMT activitywas detected in B. campestris L. (rapifera group) roots com-pared with leaves. Attieh et al.

        "Emission profiles and rates of CH3I from T. aestivum, O. sativa and R. sativusThe emission profiles of CH3I from three plant specieswere measured (Figure 1). These plants were culturedhydroponically to avoid the effect of soil microorganisms.No CH3I emissions were detected in the absence of I-;however, the emission levels rose in response to increas-ing concentrations of iodide ions ranging from 1 mM to 5mM. This indicates that free I-in water are crucial for theformation of CH3I, and that CH3I emission is affected byiodide concentration. In vivo production of CH3I wasobserved from T. aestivum, O. sativa and R. sativus when I-were supplied and the formation of CH3SH and dimethylsulfide (DMS) was always detected in GC-MS analyses(Figure 2) in the absence of halide ions.

        "rice.The worldwide areas of rice and wheat cultivation areapproximately 140-150 \u00d7 106 and 210-220 \u00d7 106 ha,respectively. It is therefore important to evaluate the levelof emissions of volatile compounds, such as methyl hali-des, from these plants and to clarify the mechanism ofsynthesis of these compounds. The emission rates of CH3Ifrom these plants in the presence of 5 mM iodide were 0.4(T. aestivum), 3.1 (O. sativa), and 30.8 \u03bcg/g fresh leaf perday (R. sativus), and correlated with the observed HMT/HTMT activities (T. aestivum, 210; O. sativa, 120; R. sativus,3,600 U/g fresh leaf). The results of this study confirm thatmethyl halide emissions from rice and wheat plants aredependent on HMT/HTMT activity. The slight differencesbetween the emission rates of T. aestivum, O. sativa, and R.sativus and their HMT/HTMT activities are probably due tothe specific properties of the HMT/HTMT in these plants,especially their Km values towards I-. Saini et al. [26] havereported that CH3I emission from leaf disks of B. oleraceawas 168.3 \u03bcg/g fresh leaf per day in the presence of 50 mMiodide. This value is comparable with that obtained for R.sativus in this study, although the experimental conditionsbetween the studies",

However,no emissions of CH3Cl or CH3Br from T. aestivum and O.sativa were observed in vivo or in vitro due to the low lev-els of HMT activity in these plants. Muramatsu and Yosh-ida [31] first confirmed the emission of CH3I from ricepaddies, and Redeker et al. [32] also detected emissions ofmethyl halides, mainly CH3I, from the same ecosysteminvolving soil, soil microorganisms, and rice plants. Morerecently, Redeker et al. [33] analyzed the methyl halideemissions from rice plants in more detail. A hydroponicsystem was adopted in the present study so that emissionsreflected those of the tested plants alone, and were notaffected by the presence of soil microorganisms. Theresults of the present study, together with the report of anHMT homologue in rice [18], indicate that rice plants pro-duce CH3I through an HMT/HTMT reaction, and soilmicroorganisms mainly play a role in liberating I-fromthe soil, where it is present as iodate (IO3 -). The meanconcentration of iodide in field soil ranges from 5 to 20mg/kg in dry soil, and around 2 mg/kg dry soil in paddysoil [31]. This difference is explained by an increase in thereductive conditions of the paddy when flooded.",

        "HTMTs of R. sativus and B. oleracea possessed sulfidemethylating activity towards NaSH. However, this activitywas weak towards (NH4)2S (Table 2). This discrepancybetween the present and previous data [15,23] could bedue to differences in the experimental conditions.(NH4)2S is not a good substrate to measure the formationof CH3SH by HTMTs. In order to measure CH3SCN orCH3CN production by HTMT with KSCN or KCN as sub-strates, the reaction mixture was measured directly by GC-14A gas chromatography because most of the CH3SCN orCH3CN was dissolved in water and did not transfer intothe gaseous phase. It was found that most of the CH3SCNproduced by the HTMT reaction in R. sativus was con-verted to CH3SH by an unknown chemical reaction cata-lyzed by a protein (Table 2). In addition, it was confirmedthat R. sativus exhibited methionine \u03b3-lyase activity thatproduces CH3SH from methionine. These results indicatethat CH3SH is possibly produced through several path-ways in R. sativus. However, DMS production could not bedetected with the HTMT reaction from SH-and SAM.Rhew et al.

        "Enzymatic properties of recombinant RsHTMTTo obtain recombinant RsHTMT, Rshtmt was introducedinto E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the expression vector pET-21b. The recombinant RsHTMT was expressed as a histi-dine-(His-) tagged soluble protein in E. coli cells and puri-fied by Ni-Sepharose resin column chromatography. Thepurified RsHTMT appeared homogenous, as judged bySDS-PAGE, and its molecular mass was estimated to be 29kDa (Figure 4). This value is close to the molecular massof 27.5 kDa predicted from the amino acid sequence ofRshtmt including the His-tag. The purified protein wascharacterized and its substrate specificity was determined.The Km values of recombinant RsHTMT for Cl-, Br-, I-, [SH]-, [SCN]-and SAM were 1656.40 mM, 177.34 mM, 4.47mM, 12.24 mM, 0.04 mM, and 0.19 mM, respectively, asshown in Table 3. The enzyme showed no activity towardsCN-. Saini et al. [28] reported Km values for Cl-, Br-, I-, [SH]-, and SAM of B. oleracea thiol methyltransferase of 85 mM,29 mM, 1.3 mM, 4.7 mM, and 0.03 mM, respectively. Thevalues obtained for RsHTMT were therefore similar to B.oleracea thiol methyltransferase in terms of methyl accep-tor preference: high specificity for I-, [SH]-, and [SCN]-,and low specificity for Cl-and Br-. Purified RsHTMTshowed a high specificity for [SCN]-, although muchlower activity was found when a crude extract was used toassay the enzyme activity (Table 2). This discrepancycould be due to the existence of other proteins in thecrude extract; however, the precise reason remainsunclear. It is known that many enzymes are inhibited inthe presence of high concentration of anions, such asbisulfide, thiocyanide, and halide ions [38-41]. Attieh etal. [25] reported that the expression pattern of thiol meth-yltransferases of B. oleracea corresponds to the concentra-tion of glucosinolate. This suggests that RsHTMT in R.sativus may be involved in the detoxification of sulfurcompounds produced by the degradation of glucosi-nolates to release them as volatile compounds. The vola-tile sulfur compounds, including CH3SH and CH3SCNand methyl halides, are believed to act as insecticidal oranti-pathogenic agents. Therefore, it is speculated thatRsHTMT in R. sativus plays a role in controlling the levelsof anions that can inhibit metabolic enzymes in the leavesand also to protect them from damage caused by insectsor",

Enzyme reactions werestarted by the addition of 0.2-1.0 ml of enzyme solution.The mixture was incubated in a 22-ml vial sealed using asilicon septum, followed by shaking at 170 rpm at 30\u00b0Cfor 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heating at 70\u00b0Cfor 5 min in a water bath. Each sample vial was then con-nected to the head space sampler and automatically heldat 70\u00b0C for 20 min to transfer volatile compounds intothe gaseous phase. The gas phase was drawn for 0.2 minafter pressuring the tube for 3 min at 70\u00b0C to carry thesample gas into the GC-MS inlet. The temperature of thetransfer line and syringe was maintained at 90\u00b0C. Thehead space gas was injected into a DB-VRX capillary col-umn (J & W Scientific; 60 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d., 1.4 \u03bcm filmthickness) for GC-MS analysis. The carrier gas (He) flowrate was 3.9 ml/min (100 kPa), and the linear velocity ofthe capillary column was 23.6 cm/s. Samples wereinjected automatically in splitless mode for 1 min at180\u00b0C with the following column temperature program:40\u00b0C for 5 min, 2\u00b0C/min increases to 50\u00b0C, and then10\u00b0C/min increases to 180\u00b0C. Mass spectra wereobtained at 70 eV using an electron-impact ion source (EI,200\u00b0C). The retention times of CH3Cl, CH3Br, CH3I,CH3SH, and DMS were 5.05, 6.20, 9.00, 5.85, and 8.90min, respectively. The products were quantified by peakarea and identified by comparison with the retentiontimes and molecular ions (m/z) of methyl halide, CH3SH,and DMS",
        "standards.The formation of CH3SCN and CH3CN in the reactionmixture was measured by GC-14A gas chromatography(Shimadzu) using a flame ionization detector. Theenzyme solution (50 \u03bcl) was added to a solution contain-ing 0.5 mM SAM, 20 mM KSCN or KCN, and 20 mM MES(pH 7.0) in a total volume of 1 ml. After incubation at 170rpm at 30\u00b0C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by heat-ing at 70\u00b0C for 5 min. A 5 \u03bcl aliquot of the reaction mix-ture was injected directly into a packed column (2.1 m \u00d73.2 mm) of Thermon1000/ShimaliteW (Shimadzu GLCInc.; column T, 80\u00b0C; injection T, 140\u00b0C; detection T,150\u00b0C; flow rate, 40 ml/min of N2) by GC. The retentiontimes of CH3CN and CH3SCN were 1.48 and 4.48 min,respectively, and the products were quantified using thepeak",

        "leaves of R. sativus were collected (10 g wet weight),ground using a mortar and pestle with sea sand (40-80mesh), and extracted with 10 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.5) supplemented with 5 mM DTT. In order to removephenolic compounds, 10% (w/v) polyvinyl polypyrro-lidone was added to the recovered supernatant. After cen-trifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min, the supernatant wasdialyzed with Tris-HCl buffer containing 5 mM DTT. Theenzyme solution was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 Manion exchange column (28 \u00d7 45 mm, Tosoh Corp.,Tokyo, Japan), which had been equilibrated with theabove buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a 0-0.3 M NaCllinear gradient in buffer (total 400 ml). The HTMT activitywas measured for all fractions obtained.

        "coli.Cloning of the HTMT coding gene from R. sativusStandard techniques were used for DNA manipulation[42]. Genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated from thesprouting leaves of R. sativus grown on Hoagland's solu-tion for 4 days. Genomic DNA was prepared by themethod of Dellaporta et al. [43]. Total RNA was isolatedusing an RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to themanufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was synthe-sized using a PrimeScript High Fidelity RT-PCR kit(TaKaRa) with an oligo dT primer, and the products wereused as PCR templates. A set of degenerate oligonucle-otide primers (sense primer, 5'-CTKGTMCCCGGMTGT-GGY-3'; antisense primer, 5'-SAGRGTKATGAGYTCKCCRTC-3') were designed on thebasis of partial amino acid sequences conserved amongthe higher plant thiol methyltransferase-and HMT-codinggenes. In order to obtain the nucleotide sequences of the3'-and 5'-ends of the HMT-coding cDNA, 3'-and 5'-rapidamplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was carried out using3'/5'-Full RACE Core Set (TaKaRa) with first strand cDNAas a template. The whole genomic and cDNA fragments ofRshtmt were amplified by PCR using primers designedfrom the nucleotide sequence of the N-and C-termini.The nucleotide sequence of Rshtmt was determined usinga capillary DNA sequencer 310 (Applied Biosystems) andwas deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ)database under accession no. AB477013.Expression and purification of recombinant RsHTMTThe Rshtmt cDNA corresponding to the mature HTMTsequence was amplified by PCR using two oligonucle-otide primers (sense primer, 5'-CCATGGATCCAATGGCT-GAGGGACAACA-3', BamHI site in italics; antisenseprimer, 5'-GTCGACTTAAAGCTTGTTGATCTTTTTCCAC-CTACC-3', HindIII site in italics). The amplified fragmentwas digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into theexpression vector pET-21b treated with the same restric-tion enzymes. The resulting plasmid encoding a His-tagged translational fusion of RhHTMT was named pET-Rshtmt and was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Trans-formants were grown on LB medium containing 50 \u03bcg/mlampicillin to OD600 0.4 at 37\u00b0C with shaking. Isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concen-tration of 1 mM to induce expression of the recombinantprotein, and cells were incubated for a further 4 hours.The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resus-pended in cell lysis buffer (20 mM MES, 0.5 M NaCl, 5mM DTT, and 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.0). The cell suspen-sion was sonicated five times for 30 s each and centrifugedat 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was loadedonto a Ni-Sepharose\u2122 high performance column (1 mlbed volume). The column was washed with 10 ml of celllysis buffer and recombinant RsHTMT fused to the His-tagwas eluted using elution buffer (20 mM MES, 0.5 M NaCl,5 mM DTT, and 0.5 M imidazole, pH 7.0).
