Halogenases are a type of tailoring enzymes that are usually found within these secondary gene clusters. In this study, we identified an indole-type halometabolite 6-chrolo-1H-indole-3-car-boxamide, named LYXLF2, by whole genome mining and metabolic profiling of a flavin-dependent halogenase mutant. LYXLF2 is a new plant growth-regulating com-pound that promotes root elongation. The results of this study demonstrated that the special gene knock-out/com-parative metabolic profiling approach provides a powerful tool for the discovery of novel natural products by genome mining. Introduction The term \u2018\u2018genome mining\u2019\u2019 has been used to describe the exploitation of genomic information for the discovery of new processes, targets, and products [2]. It is possible to estimate the biosynthetic potential of a given organism by mining the whole genome sequence [16], especially the polyketide (PK) and non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) biosynthetic gene clusters. However, it is generally not possible to predict the exact structures of new products by analyzing the backbone synthetases [9]. Tailoring enzymes, such as glycosyltransferases, methyltransferases and halogenases, are important for forming the final products and can affect their activity. Flavin-dependent halogenases play a vital role in the biosynthesis of organohalogens that display a wide range of biological activities, such as vancomycin (antibacterial), cryptophycin (antitumor), and salinosporamide A (protea-some inhibition). The genes that encode the flavin-depen-dent halogenases are usually discovered among secondary gene clusters, and the enzymes display strict substrate specificity. The flavin-dependent halogenases recognize tryptophan/indole, phenol/pyrrole and aliphatic moieties [18]. Additionally, these halogenases are found to require the cofactor FADH2, which can be produced from FAD and NADH by nonspecific flavin reductases [17]. Genome mining or scanning strategies have led to the discovery of novel flavin-dependent halogenases distributed across diverse microbes in recent years [1, 8, 12, 20]. Amycolatopsis orientalis HCCB10007 is an important species of actinobacteria that produces vancomycin and a linear polyene antibiotic ECO-0501. Recently, the whole genome of A. orientalis HCCB10007 was sequenced by our group (GenBank Accession No. CP003410), and more than 20 secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00284-016-1052-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. & Li Zhu zhulicyh@163.com & XiuPing Qian qianxp@sjtu.edu.cn 1 School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiaotong University, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, China 2 Shanghai Vocational College of Agriculture and Forest, Shanghai 201600, China 3 Shanghai Laiyi Center for Biopharmaceuticals R&D, Shanghai 201203, China 123 Curr Microbiol (2016) 73:335\u2013340 DOI 10.1007/s00284-016-1052-6 were found based on genome scanning strategy [19]. Among them, four halogenase genes (AORI_5336, AORI_5364, AORI_6626 and AORI_6627) embedded in different gene clusters were predicted. In the present study, we characterized the halogenase gene AORI_5336 and deposited it as a flavin-dependent halogenase. In an attempt to find new compounds, we compared the changes of metabolites before and after AORI_5336 gene disruption and a new halogenated compound LYXLF2, with plant growth-regulating activity was found in the broth of A. orientalis. This work provides an alternative method for mining natural products. Materials and Methods Strains, Plasmids, Medium and Growth Conditions The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. All of the A. orientalis strains were grown at 28 NoneC on Gause\u2019s synthetic agar medium. Ten types of production media were used in the metabolic profiling comparisons. Details regarding the media and culture conditions are shown in Table S2. Phylogenetic Analysis of Halogenase Genes The sequences of 15 known halogenases, including PrnA (U74493), RebH (AJ414559), PyrH (AY623051), Thal (EF095207), CmdE (AM179409), CrpH (EF159954), BhaA (Y16952), McnD (DQ075244), PltA (AF081920), HalB (AF450451), Pyr29 (EF140901), Clo-Hal (AF329398), CalO3 (AF497482), CmlS (AY026946) and NapH2 (EF397638), were located in the NCBI database. These halogenases are involved in the halogenation of different structures. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor. phylogenetic analysis of the halogenases was performed using the Mega 4.1 tool. The tree topography and evolu-tionary distances were determined using the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates. Disruption of AORI_5336 Gene The primer pairs 5336UF/5336UR and 5336DF/5336DR were designed to amplify the upstream and downstream regions of the AORI_5336 gene, respectively. The upstream and downstream fragments were digested by BglII/XbaI and XbaI/HindIII, and linked with the pLYZL102 fragment obtained by Bg II/HindIII digestion, respectively, to construct the deletion plasmid pLYXL5336. Plasmid pLYXL5336 was isolated from E. coli JM110 and subsequently introduced into A. orientalis DVE by electroporation performed in 2 mm electrode gap cuvettes at 7.5 kV/cm for approximately 13 ms. Single-crossover cells were selected with apramy-cin (50 lg/ml) on Bennet agar medium. The apramycin-resistant colonies were used to inoculate antibiotic-free liquid tryptic soy broth to allow for the formation of dou-ble-crossover clones. The construction of the mutant was confirmed by PCR using primers 5336VF and 5336VR with genomic DNA isolated from the parental A. orientalis DVE and potential mutants as templates (Fig. S2). The resulting mutant strain was designated as D5336. All of the primers used in this study are listed in Table S3. Complementation of the AORI_5336 Disrupted Mutant To complement the mutant strain D5336, AORI_5336 and a 300 bp upstream region were amplified from genomic DNA of A. orientalis DVE using the primers 5336CF/ 5336CR and introducing XbaI sites at both ends. The PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and ligated with pULVK2A [4], which was digested by the same endonu-clease, to generate pLYXL5336c. The expression vector pLYXL5336c was introduced into A. orientalis D5336 by electroporation to yield the strain C5336. Compound Purification Large-scale cultures of A. orientalis HCCB10007 were grown, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 30 min. A PS25-300 column was used to remove impurities, followed by a column (70 9 1000 mm) filled with XAD 1600 resin. Then, fractions containing LYXLF2 were applied to an Agilent SB C18 column (5 lm, 9.4 9 250 mm) for final purification with solutions A (0.05 % aqueous TFA solution) and B (0.05 % TFA-ace-tonitrile) as the mobile phase. HPLC, MS and NMR Analysis Samples were analyzed on an Agilent Poroshell 120 SB C18 column (2.7 lm, 4.6 9 150 mm) and eluted with 0.05 % aqueous TFA solution and 0.05 %TFA-acetonitrile solution at 1 ml/min. The metabolites were detected by monitoring the absorbance at 223 nm.ESI\u2013MS spectrawere takenwith a Waters Q-TOF\u2013MS Premier spectrometer in m/z (rel. %), and NMR spectra were measured with a Buker-Avance-400 spectrometer in DMSO-d6 (d in ppm, J in Hz). Plant and Bioassay Arabidopsis thaliana and wheat seeds were used in this test. The growth-promoting activity of LYXLF2 was 336 L. Xu et al.: Discovery of the New Plant Growth-Regulating Compound LYXLF2\u2026 123 evaluated in regards to seed growth. The compounds were evaluated at concentrations of 0.005, 0.05, 0.5 and 5 mg/l, respectively. Seeds were placed on absorbent paper in a plate that had been sufficiently moistened with 3 ml of the test solution. After 7 days of cultivation in the dark, root lengths were measured. The growth-regulating rate was calculated as a percentage of the average length of a root from the treated plant relative to the control water. The compounds indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-bu-tyric acid (IBA) were also assayed with the same methods. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Results Identification of a Halogenase Gene in the New NRPS/PKS Hybrid Gene Cluster Encoded by the A. orientalis Genome An NRPS/PKS hybrid gene cluster named n_p2 that encodes for the biosynthesis of an unknown compound in the A. orientalis HCCB10007 genome has been identified, and the transcription levels of n_p2 were significantly higher than most other genes [19]. The n_p2 cluster is approximately 58 kb and contains 24 genes, one of which was proposed to encode a halogenase (AORI_5336) (Fig. 1). Fifteen known halogenases that catalyze the halogenation of different substances were chosen for multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses with the putative halogenases (AORI_5336) in the genome. The multiple alignment analysis revealed that AORI_5336 had two conserved regions, a G 9 G 9 G motif near the N-terminus exhibited the FAD-binding domain, and another domain W 9 W 9 IP in the middle of the sequence was responsible for specifically binding a substrate and cat-alyzing an enzymatic reaction. In addition, a gene downstream AORI_5336 that encodes a flavin reductase (AORI_5335) was proposed to provide the cofactor FADH2. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AORI_5336 fell into the same clade as Thal, a tryptophan-6-halogenase (Fig. 2) [13]. These characteristics belong to the Flavin-dependent halogenases [17] (Fig. S1). Deletion of AORI_5336 Revealed a Halogenated Natural Product To avoid the known metabolites, the strain A. orientalis DVE, with the disruption of both vancomycin and ECO-0501 biosynthesis, was chosen as the parental strain. The deletion mutant A. orientalis D5336 was assessed for sec-ondary metabolite production during growth in ten differ-ent fermentation media (Table S2). Using a strategy combining gene knockouts and metabolic profiling, a peak eluting with a retention time of approximately 19 min was observed by HPLC in the wild-type strain A. orientalis DVE (Fig. 3a) in F2 media, and was absent in the mutant. The substance responsible for this peak was designated LYXLF2. To confirm that the production of this substance relied on AORI_5336, AORI_5336 was reintroduced into D5336 to generate the strain C5336. The product was restored in C5336. Accordingly, it was proposed that LYXLF2 was an organohalogen, and AORI_5336 per-formed the halogenation of this compound. Structure Identification of LYXLF2 LYXLF2 was obtained as a pale powder. The molecular formula of LYXLF2 was established as C9H7ClN2O on the basis of HRESI-MS at m/z 195.0293 [M?H]? (calcd. for 195.0325). In the HRESI-MS, a [M?H]? ion cluster at m/z 195.0293/197.0283 in the ratio of 3:1 was observed, characteristic of a mono-chlorinated structure (Fig. 3b).

Xu et al.: Discovery of the New Plant Growth-Regulating Compound LYXLF2\u2026 337 123 Analysis of the 1H NMR data[(11.71(brs, H-CONH2), 8.16 (d, J = 8.5, H-4), 8.09 (s, H-2), 7.51 (d, J = 1.8 Hz, H-7), 7.13 (dd, J = 8.5, 1.8 Hz, H-5)] for LYXLF2 revealed the presence of nearly identical structural features to those found in compound 6, except that the 1H\u20131H coupling constant observed between H-4 and H-5 or H-6 were dif-ferent (J = 8.5 Hz in LYXLF2; J = 2.2 Hz in compound 6) (Fig. S4) [3]. The data implied that LYXLF2 was an isomer of compound 6; thus, the Cl atom should be located at C-6 in LYXLF2. The structure of LYXLF2 was there-fore concluded to be 6-chrolo-1H-indole-3-carboxamide (Fig. 3c). Database (Sci Finder and Reaxy) search results revealed that LYXLF2 could be a novel natural product that has not been previously reported. Flavin-dependent halogenases are involved in the halo-genation of different structures, such as tryptophan, phe-nolic and indole moieties, pyrrole moieties, phenolic moieties and aliphatic moieties [18]. In this study, the structure of LYXLF2 was identified as an indole-like substance. Therefore, AORI_5336 catalyzed the halogena-tions at C6 of 1H-indole-3-carboxamide. Biological Activity of LYXLF2 Plant growth activities of LYXLF2, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) were examined using bioassays with Arabidopsis thaliana and wheat seedling (Fig. 4). Compound LYXLF2 and IBA promoted A. thaliana root growth within the range of 0.005\u20130.5 mg/l. The root elongation of A. thaliana treated with LYXLF2 was maximally improved by 23 % of the control at a concentration of 0.05 mg/l, and when treated with IBA it was improved by 10 % at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, however, IAA showed no improvement effects on root elongation at the same concentration. When the root growth of wheat was examined, both LYXLF2 and IAA had stimulation roles within the range of 0.005\u20135 mg/l. LYXLF2 accelerated root elongation maximally by 37 % of the control at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l. The com-pound IAA showed maximal acceleration by 17 % of the control at the same concentration. In contrast, IBA inhib-ited wheat root growth from 0.005 to 5 mg/l. The results indicated that LYXLF2 is a novel plant growth-regulating substance.

Xu et al.: Discovery of the New Plant Growth-Regulating Compound LYXLF2\u2026 123 Discussion Genome-sequencing projects on different filamentous actinomycetes have revealed numerous natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in each genome. In addition, sequence-guided predictions and subsequent identification of novel metabolites have been processed well in some strains, such as siderophores from Streptomyces coelicolor [11] and pentalenolactone or pentaene from Streptomyces avermitilis [15]. A. orientalis, a type of rare actinomycetes, has 26 gene clusters related to secondary metabolism, including the vancomycin and ECO-0501 gene clusters, which were predicted in the genome [19]. This indicates that there is an abundance of undiscovered secondary metabolites in this organism waiting for us to explore. In this study, to exclude the effects of vancomycin and ECO-0501, the mutants had both biosynthetic pathways blocked. The halogenase AORI_5336 was first predicted by phylogenetic analysis and defined as a flavin-dependent halogenase. Then, AORI_5336 was knocked out and a new compound was found by comparing the metabolic profiling of the mutants in up to ten different media. Hornung et al. identified 103 novel putative halogenase genes from 550 randomly selected actinomycetes strains by PCR screening and found two halometabolites by mass spectrometric analysis of cultured filtrates [8]. Gao et al. also used the same method to detect 54 potential gene clusters for organohalogen compounds from 228 actinomycetes and did not find new bioactive compounds [7]. In comparison, our results demonstrated that the gene knockout/compara-tive metabolic profiling approach was an efficient method to discover new compounds from well-known strains. There are two classes of flavin-dependent halogenases according to the status of the substrates, including halo-genase activity with a free substrate, such as PrnA [5], and halogenase activity requiring a peptidyl carrier protein-tethered substrate, such as PltA [6]. In this study, LYXLF2 disappeared when AORI_5336 was knocked out, and the theoretical precursor, 1H-indole-3-carboxamide, was also not found, which suggested that AORI_5336 did not cat-alyze a free substrate. Additionally, AORI_5337, a gene upstream of AORI_5336, encoded NRPS. The disruption of AORI_5337 blocked the biosynthesis of the compound LYXLF2 (Fig. S5). Therefore, it was suggested that AORI_5336 reacted with a peptidyl carrier protein-tethered substrate. Additionally, the structure of LYXLF2 was far different from the predicted product of n_p2, suggesting that only several of the genes in the cluster, including AORI_5335, AORI_5336 and AORI_5337, were essential for the biosynthesis of this compound. The gene cluster encoding LYXLF2 might be independent of n_p2. LYXLF2, 6-chrolo-1H-indole-3-carboxamide, an indole alkaloid with halogen substituent, has an active role on plant seeds rooting. It is well-known that the indole nucleus is one of the most important ring systems for pharmaceu-tical development [14]. In this study, LYXLF2 showed better effect on the root growth of A. thaliana and wheat compared to IBA and IAA. In addition to LYXLF2, bre-vicompanines were another plant growth regulator found in the microorganism Penicillim brevicompactum [10]. LYXLF2 was the first Amycolatopsis metabolite identified that promotes the growth of plant seedlings.

        "The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. All of the A. orientalis strains were grown at 28 NoneC on Gause\u2019s synthetic agar medium. Ten types of production media were used in the metabolic profiling comparisons. Details regarding the media and culture conditions are shown in Table S2.",
        "Phylogenetic Analysis of Halogenase Genes",
        "The sequences of 15 known halogenases, including PrnA (U74493), RebH (AJ414559), PyrH (AY623051), Thal (EF095207), CmdE (AM179409), CrpH (EF159954), BhaA (Y16952), McnD (DQ075244), PltA (AF081920), HalB (AF450451), Pyr29 (EF140901), Clo-Hal (AF329398), CalO3 (AF497482), CmlS (AY026946) and NapH2 (EF397638), were located in the NCBI database. These halogenases are involved in the halogenation of different structures. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor. phylogenetic analysis of the halogenases was performed using the Mega 4.1 tool. The tree topography and evolu-tionary distances were determined using the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates.",
        "Disruption of AORI_5336 Gene",
        "The primer pairs 5336UF/5336UR and 5336DF/5336DR were designed to amplify the upstream and downstream regions of the AORI_5336 gene, respectively. The upstream and downstream fragments were digested by BglII/XbaI and XbaI/HindIII, and linked with the pLYZL102 fragment obtained by Bg II/HindIII digestion, respectively, to construct the deletion plasmid pLYXL5336. Plasmid pLYXL5336 was isolated from E. coli JM110 and subsequently introduced into A. orientalis DVE by electroporation performed in 2 mm electrode gap cuvettes at 7.5 kV/cm for approximately 13 ms. Single-crossover cells were selected with apramy-cin (50 lg/ml) on Bennet agar medium. The apramycin-resistant colonies were used to inoculate antibiotic-free liquid tryptic soy broth to allow for the formation of dou-ble-crossover clones. The construction of the mutant was confirmed by PCR using primers 5336VF and 5336VR with genomic DNA isolated from the parental A. orientalis DVE and potential mutants as templates (Fig. S2). The resulting mutant strain was designated as D5336. All of the primers used in this study are listed in Table S3.",
        "Complementation of the AORI_5336 Disrupted Mutant",
        "To complement the mutant strain D5336, AORI_5336 and a 300 bp upstream region were amplified from genomic DNA of A. orientalis DVE using the primers 5336CF/ 5336CR and introducing XbaI sites at both ends. The PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and ligated with pULVK2A [4], which was digested by the same endonu-clease, to generate pLYXL5336c. The expression vector pLYXL5336c was introduced into A. orientalis D5336 by electroporation to yield the strain C5336.",
        "Compound Purification",
        "Large-scale cultures of A. orientalis HCCB10007 were grown, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 30 min. A PS25-300 column was used to remove impurities, followed by a column (70 9 1000 mm) filled with XAD 1600 resin. Then, fractions containing LYXLF2 were applied to an Agilent SB C18 column (5 lm, 9.4 9 250 mm) for final purification with solutions A (0.05 % aqueous TFA solution) and B (0.05 % TFA-ace-tonitrile) as the mobile phase.",

The growth-regulating rate was calculated as a percentage of the average length of a root from the treated plant relative to the control water. The compounds indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-bu-tyric acid (IBA) were also assayed with the same methods. All experiments were performed in triplicate.",
        "Results",
        "Identification of a Halogenase Gene in the New NRPS/PKS Hybrid Gene Cluster Encoded by the A. orientalis Genome",
        "An NRPS/PKS hybrid gene cluster named n_p2 that encodes for the biosynthesis of an unknown compound in the A. orientalis HCCB10007 genome has been identified, and the transcription levels of n_p2 were significantly higher than most other genes [19]. The n_p2 cluster is approximately 58 kb and contains 24 genes, one of which was proposed to encode a halogenase (AORI_5336) (Fig. 1). Fifteen known halogenases that catalyze the halogenation of different substances were chosen for multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses with the putative halogenases (AORI_5336) in the genome. The multiple alignment analysis revealed that AORI_5336 had two conserved regions, a G 9 G 9 G motif near the N-terminus exhibited the FAD-binding domain, and another domain W 9 W 9 IP in the middle of the sequence was responsible for specifically binding a substrate and cat-alyzing an enzymatic reaction. In addition, a gene downstream AORI_5336 that encodes a flavin reductase (AORI_5335) was proposed to provide the cofactor FADH2. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AORI_5336 fell into the same clade as Thal, a tryptophan-6-halogenase (Fig. 2) [13]. These characteristics belong to the Flavin-dependent halogenases [17] (Fig. S1).",
        "Deletion of AORI_5336 Revealed a Halogenated Natural Product",
        "To avoid the known metabolites, the strain A. orientalis DVE, with the disruption of both vancomycin and ECO-0501 biosynthesis, was chosen as the parental strain. The deletion mutant A. orientalis D5336 was assessed for sec-ondary metabolite production during growth in ten differ-ent fermentation media (Table S2). Using a strategy combining gene knockouts and metabolic profiling, a peak eluting with a retention time of approximately 19 min was observed by HPLC in the wild-type strain A. orientalis DVE (Fig. 3a) in F2 media, and was absent in the mutant. The substance responsible for this peak was designated LYXLF2. To confirm that the production of this substance relied on AORI_5336, AORI_5336 was reintroduced into D5336 to generate the strain C5336. The product was restored in C5336. Accordingly, it was proposed that LYXLF2 was an organohalogen, and AORI_5336 per-formed the halogenation of this compound.",

        "LYXLF2 was obtained as a pale powder. The molecular formula of LYXLF2 was established as C9H7ClN2O on the basis of HRESI-MS at m/z 195.0293 [M?H]? (calcd. for 195.0325). In the HRESI-MS, a [M?H]? ion cluster at m/z 195.0293/197.0283 in the ratio of 3:1 was observed, characteristic of a mono-chlorinated structure (Fig. 3b).",

The data implied that LYXLF2 was an isomer of compound 6; thus, the Cl atom should be located at C-6 in LYXLF2. The structure of LYXLF2 was there-fore concluded to be 6-chrolo-1H-indole-3-carboxamide (Fig. 3c).

The root elongation of A. thaliana treated with LYXLF2 was maximally improved by 23 % of the control at a concentration of 0.05 mg/l, and when treated with IBA it was improved by 10 % at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, however, IAA showed no improvement effects on root elongation at the same concentration. When the root growth of wheat was examined, both LYXLF2 and IAA had stimulation roles within the range of 0.005\u20135 mg/l. LYXLF2 accelerated root elongation maximally by 37 % of the control at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l. The com-pound IAA showed maximal acceleration by 17 % of the control at the same concentration. In contrast, IBA inhib-ited wheat root growth from 0.005 to 5 mg/l. The results indicated that LYXLF2 is a novel plant growth-regulating substance.",

        "Discussion",
        "Genome-sequencing projects on different filamentous actinomycetes have revealed numerous natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in each genome. In addition, sequence-guided predictions and subsequent identification of novel metabolites have been processed well in some strains, such as siderophores from Streptomyces coelicolor [11] and pentalenolactone or pentaene from Streptomyces avermitilis [15]. A. orientalis, a type of rare actinomycetes, has 26 gene clusters related to secondary metabolism, including the vancomycin and ECO-0501 gene clusters, which were predicted in the genome [19]. This indicates that there is an abundance of undiscovered secondary metabolites in this organism waiting for us to explore.",
        "In this study, to exclude the effects of vancomycin and ECO-0501, the mutants had both biosynthetic pathways blocked. The halogenase AORI_5336 was first predicted by phylogenetic analysis and defined as a flavin-dependent halogenase. Then, AORI_5336 was knocked out and a new compound was found by comparing the metabolic profiling of the mutants in up to ten different media. Hornung et al. identified 103 novel putative halogenase genes from 550 randomly selected actinomycetes strains by PCR screening and found two halometabolites by mass spectrometric analysis of cultured filtrates [8]. Gao et al. also used the same method to detect 54 potential gene clusters for organohalogen compounds from 228 actinomycetes and did not find new bioactive compounds [7]. In comparison, our results demonstrated that the gene knockout/compara-tive metabolic profiling approach was an efficient method to discover new compounds from well-known strains.",
        "There are two classes of flavin-dependent halogenases according to the status of the substrates, including halo-genase activity with a free substrate, such as PrnA [5], and halogenase activity requiring a peptidyl carrier protein-tethered substrate, such as PltA [6]. In this study, LYXLF2 disappeared when AORI_5336 was knocked out, and the theoretical precursor, 1H-indole-3-carboxamide, was also not found, which suggested that AORI_5336 did not cat-alyze a free substrate. Additionally, AORI_5337, a gene upstream of AORI_5336, encoded NRPS. The disruption of AORI_5337 blocked the biosynthesis of the compound LYXLF2 (Fig. S5). Therefore, it was suggested that AORI_5336 reacted with a peptidyl carrier protein-tethered substrate. Additionally, the structure of LYXLF2 was far different from the predicted product of n_p2, suggesting that only several of the genes in the cluster, including AORI_5335, AORI_5336 and AORI_5337, were essential for the biosynthesis of this compound. The gene cluster encoding LYXLF2 might be independent of n_p2.",
        "LYXLF2, 6-chrolo-1H-indole-3-carboxamide, an indole alkaloid with halogen substituent, has an active role on plant seeds rooting. It is well-known that the indole nucleus is one of the most important ring systems for pharmaceu-tical development [14]. In this study, LYXLF2 showed better effect on the root growth of A. thaliana and wheat compared to IBA and IAA. In addition to LYXLF2, bre-vicompanines were another plant growth regulator found in the microorganism Penicillim brevicompactum [10]. LYXLF2 was the first Amycolatopsis metabolite identified that promotes the growth of plant seedlings.",
