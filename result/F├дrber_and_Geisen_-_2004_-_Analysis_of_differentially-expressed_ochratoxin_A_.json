The differential conditions were achieved by growth on different minimal media which either support or inhibit ochratoxin A production. Thirty differentially expressed genes were identified. The DDRT-PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced. The sequences obtained were analysed for homology at the protein level by GeneBank comparison. This analysis revealed several fragments with homology to enzymes which are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of ochratoxin A, in particular a polyketide synthase, a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, a halogenase, a phenylalanine t-RNA synthetase, a methylase and a fragment with homology to ABC transporter genes. All other induced genes either showed no homology to known sequences or are genes whose induction can be explained by growth in different minimal media. Introduction Ochratoxin A is an important mycotoxin which can occur in different food commodities such as cereals, coffee, wine, beer and spices (Ho\u0308hler, 1998). Ochratoxin A is nephrotoxic with additional teratogenic and immunogenic effects (Petzinger and Ziegler, 2000). It is classified as a carcinogen and for that reason the occurrence of ochratoxin A in plant products produced for human nutrition has to be minimised. In regions with a temperate climate Penicillium species are mainly responsible for the production of ochratoxin A in cereals and cereal products. In warmer regions, Aspergillus species such as A. ochraceus, A. carbonarius or A. niger are responsible for the presence of ochratoxin A in products such as coffee (Bucheli et al., 2000; Joosten et al., 2001), spices (Thirumala-Devi et al., 2002) and wine (Pietri et al., 2001; Cabanes et al., 2002; Da Rocha Rosa et al., 2002). Until recently, P. verrucosum was the only species of the genus Penicillium which had been shown to produce ochratoxin A. Detailed analyses at the biochemical (Larsen et al., 2001) and genetic levels (Castella et al., 2002), however, revealed that two closely related but distinct species, namely P. verrucosum and P. nordicum, were able to produce ochratoxin A. Penicillium verrucosum occurs mainly on cereals and is responsible for the production of ochratoxin A in this food commodity, whereas P. nordicum is a contaminant of protein-rich foods such as cheeses and meat products. Ochratoxin is a composite mycotoxin, consisting of the amino acid phenylalanine and the pentake-tide dehydroisocoumarin (Figure 1). A biosyn-thetic pathway for ochratoxin A was outlined by Huff and Hamilton (1979). However, recent results demonstrate that there are ambiguities in the pathway, because mellein, a precursor suggested by Huff and Hamilton (1979) does not play a role in European Journal of Plant Pathology 110: 661\u2013669, 2004. None 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands. the biosynthetic pathway according to results of Harris and Mantle (2001). Much less is known about the genetic background of ochratoxin A biosynthesis. According to the proposed biosyn-thetic pathway, the minimal requirements at the genetic level are genes for a polyketide synthase, required for the synthesis of the polyketide dihy-dro-isocoumarin, a methylase for the formation of the carboxyl group, an ochratoxin A synthase (peptide synthetase) for ligation of the amino acid phenylalanine and the polyketide, and finally a chloroperoxidase or halogenase for the introduc-tion of the chlorine atom. In a recent report, the putative polyketide synthase from P. nordicum has been partly characterised (Geisen et al., in press) and its expression was correlated to ochratoxin A production. O\u2019Callaghan et al. (2003) also de-scribed part of a gene coding for a polyketide synthase involved in ochratoxin A biosynthesis in Aspergillus ochraceus. The Differential Display Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (DDRT-PCR) approach was first described by Liang and Pardee (1992) for use in plants. In the meantime, this approach has also been adapted to identify differentially expressed genes in fungi. Benito et al. (1996) used this method to identify genes which are up-regulated during plant-fungus interactions. Melin et al. (1999) analysed changes in gene expression in Aspergillus nidulans due to the presence of the antibiotic bafilomycin. To use the DDRT-PCR approach for the analysis of genes differentially expressed during ochratoxin A biosynthesis, two different RNA populations were compared. One RNA population was isolated under conditions which did not support the pro-duction of ochratoxin A and the other RNA population was isolated under ochratoxin A-pro-ducing conditions. In this paper we report the identification of differentially expressed genes of P. nordicum by DDRT-PCR under conditions which support ochratoxin A production. Materials and methods Strains and culture conditions Penicillium nordicum BFE487 was used through-out this study. This strain is a reliable ochratoxin A producer. Ochratoxin A production was deter-mined on YES medium. Strain maintenance and routine growth experiments were performed on malt extract agar/medium (17 g l)1 malt extract, 5 g l)1 glucose, 15 g l)1 agar, pH 6.5). Incubation was carried out at 25 NoneC for 4\u20137 days. For differ-ential ochratoxin A production, the strains were grown in a mineral salt minimal medium (3.8 g l)1 KH2PO4, 0.5 g l )1 MgSO4 \u00b7 7H2O, 0.1 g l)1 NaCl, 0.1 g l)1 CaCl2, 0.7 g l )1 KOH, 15 g l)1 agar, pH 6.5) which supported ochratoxin A pro-duction (supplemented with 5.0 g l)1 glycerol and 2.5 g l)1 NH4Cl) and the same minimal medium, supplemented with 5.0 g l)1 glucose and 1.2 g l)1 KNO3, which suppressed ochratoxin A produc-tion. Isolation of fungal DNA DNA was isolated using a method modified from that of Yelton et al. (1984). Seventy-two to 96 h old mycelia were harvested from a submerged culture by filtration. The mycelia were transferred Figure 1. Structural formula of ochratoxin A demonstrating the metabolic origin of the structural parts of the molecule. (A) The to a mortar and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen mycelia were ground to a powder and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM EDTA; 0.2 % SDS; pH 8.5). This suspension was heated to 68 NoneC for 15 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 15.000 \u00b7 g. After centrifugation, 7 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and 1 ml of 4 M sodium acetate added. This solution was placed on ice for 1 h and centrifuged for 15 min at 15.000 \u00b7 g. After centrifugation 6 ml of the supernatant were transferred to a fresh tube. The solution was extracted with phenol and the isolated DNA was precipitated by the addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The isolated DNA was assessed on an agarose gel and the concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (Sam-brook et al., 1989). Isolation of total RNA from pure cultures Penicillium nordicum was grown in the respective minimal medium for 4 days. The mycelium was harvested and 0.5 g was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to powder in a mortar. Two hundred mg of the powder was used for isolation of total fungal RNA. For that purpose the E.Z.N.A. Fungal RNA kit (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany) was used. Eighty ll of the RNA preparation was treated with 2 ll DNase I (2.5 Kunitz units/ll, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) for degradation of traces of genomic DNA. The solution was incu-bated for 60 min at 37 NoneC and subsequently for 10 min at 65 NoneC to inactivate the DNase. An ali-quot of the RNA was separated on an agarose gel, prepared as described by Sambrook et al. (1989), to check the integrity of the RNA. cDNA synthesis Eight ll of the total RNA treated with DNase I was used along with the Omniscript Reverse Transcription kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 NoneC for 1 h. The cDNA was either directly used for DDRT-PCR experiments or stored at )20 NoneC. DDRT-PCR experiments A CLONTECH DeltaNone Differential Display Kit (PT1173-1, CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, USA) was used. The displays were completed with negative as well as positive control reactions. PCRs were performed in the presence of [a-33P]dATP (25 lCi) to label the DDRT-PCR fragments. Electrophoresis of DDRT-PCR prod-ucts was performed by the use of a temperature-controlled electrophoresis system (Sequi-Gen GT, Biorad, Hercules, USA) for maximum resolution. Products of DDRT-PCR reactions were separated on 6% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gels (2 mm) in 0.5X TBE buffer (1200 V). The gels were pre-run for 30 min. After electrophoresis the gel was transferred on to a Whatman filter paper and dried at 75 NoneC for 1 h. Autoradiography The dried gel was exposed to a Kodak BioMax MR (875 6447, Kodak, Rochester, New York, USA) scientific imaging film for 12\u201314 h at )70 NoneC. The position of the X-ray film on the dried gel was marked to ensure the precise excision of differentially expressed bands. Isolation of the DDRT-PCR fragments The developed X-ray film was aligned on the dried polyacrylamide gel. The gel regions below the autoradiographic signals were cut out with a scal-pel. The gel blocks were transferred into a fresh reaction tube with 40 ll of Tricine-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tricine (pH 9.5), 0.2 mM EDTA). A few drops of mineral oil were used to overlay and to protect the solution against evaporation during the following heating step at 100 NoneC for 5 min. Reamplification All isolated differentially expressed bands were reamplified and assessed on an agarose gel for their size and purity (data not shown). Cloning and sequencing of the DDRT-PCR fragments All isolated DDRT-PCR fragments were cloned into the Invitrogen TOPO TA-cloning vector (K4595-40, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). The cloned DDRT-PCR fragments were sequenced using standard techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989). 663 Standard nucleotide and protein BLAST analysis Standard BLAST analyses were performed at the nucleotide and protein level (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/BLAST/). For homology searches at the protein level, possible continuous open reading frames were determined in both directions and translated to the amino acid sequences. Results Ochratoxin A production by Penicillium nordicum on different media To identify growth conditions which either sup-port or inhibit ochratoxin A production by P. nordicum without influencing other pathways or genes, a minimal medium which contained the basic nutrients was varied in its composition. In experiments with media in which only one of the basic nutrients was exchanged, KNO3 and glucose inhibited toxin production, whereas NH4Cl and glycerol supported ochratoxin A biosynthesis (data not shown). For the experiments described, the inhibitory or supporting nutrients were used in combination to enhance this effect. As a result, it was possible to adjust supporting and inhibiting conditions by just changing two basic nutrients, in particular the carbon and nitrogen sources. The minimal medium which contained glucose and KNO3 proved to be inhibitory for ochratoxin A production, whereas the same minimal medium supplemented with glycerol and NH4Cl supported ochratoxin A production. This was clearly dem-onstrated by thin layer chromatography (Figure 2). The growth rates were nearly unaf-fected in both media compared to the routinely used complex media (Figure 3), indicating that the change in the medium composition specifically influences ochratoxin A biosynthesis and not general growth behaviour. Analysis of differentially expressed genes under ochratoxin A production conditions by DDRT-PCR Cultures of P. nordicum were grown for 4 days under shaking conditions and the mycelium was harvested. The total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed and subjected to DDRT-PCR with different sets of anchored and random primers. An example of the results is shown in Figure 4. Genes which are up-regulated under ochratoxin A production conditions were highlighted by this method (Figure 4, arrow). In total, 30 upregulated genes were identified under ochratoxin A-produc-Figure 2. Differential production of ochratoxin A after growth in different media monitored by thin layer chromatography. Both ing conditions. All 30 fragments were excised from the gel, cloned into a TA cloning vector and se-quenced. The sequences of the DDRT-PCR frag-ments were translated into the protein sequence and compared to published sequences in the GeneBank database by BLAST searches. The homologies found are listed in Table 1. Several of the identified fragments had homologies to genes postulated for the ochratoxin A biosynthetic pathway, in particular a polyketide synthase (3 fragments), a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (2 fragments), an phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase (1 fragment), a methyl transferase (1 fragment), a halogenase (1 fragment) and ABC transporter genes related to secondary metabolism (1 frag-ment). Other upregulated genes are house-keeping genes and appear to be induced by growth in dif-ferent media, in the same way as the up-regulation of membrane channel proteins, enzymes of the citrate cycle, putative transcription factors, trans-lation elongation factor, genes of ammonium metabolism and several ribosomal proteins. The results obtained by this DDRT-PCR approach are conclusive under these growth conditions. Discussion Very little is known about the genetics of ochra-toxin A biosynthesis in Aspergillus or Penicillium. Recently a polyketide synthase was characterised and it was expressed in relation to ochratoxin A biosynthesis (Geisen et al., in press). In the de-scribed DDRT-PCR analysis, fragments with homology to polyketide synthase (pks) genes were identified, supporting the observation that a pks gene is induced under conditions where ochratoxin Figure 3. Comparison of mycelial growth on both minimal Table 1. Homology of sequenced DDRT-PCR fragments at the protein level A is produced. Homologues of genes of many as-sumed enzymes for ochratoxin A biosynthesis were identified. A non-ribosomal peptide synthase was induced under ochratoxin A production condi-tions. This might be the postulated ochratoxin A synthetase (Huff and Hamilton, 1979) which completes the peptide coupling of the amino acid phenylalanine to the polyketide dihydro-isocoum-arin. In addition, the induction of a methyl transferase was observed. Ochratoxin A is a methylated compound (Harris and Mantle, 2001). According to the suggested pathway (Huff and Hamilton, 1979) the polyketide is methylated and the methyl group is further oxidised to the car-boxyl group, which is involved in the peptide bond to the amino acid phenylalanine (Figure 1). The methylation inhibitor ethionine completely inhibits the production of ochratoxin A, indicating the importance of these enzymatic activities (Yama-zaki et al., 1971). A gene with homology to an halogenase is also induced during ochratoxin A biosynthesis. Kirner et al. (1998) described an halogenase responsible for the chlorination of L-tryptophane during the biosynthesis of pyrrolni-trin, a secondary metabolite with antifungal activity produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. The halogenase homologue identified in this study might be responsible for the chlorination of och-ratoxin B to ochratoxin A (Huff and Hamilton, 1979). During ochratoxin A biosynthesis, the meta-bolic flux of phenylalanine is re-routed from pro-tein biosynthesis to ochratoxin A biosynthesis. The analysed strain of P. nordicum is a very strong ochratoxin A-producing organism. If this strain grows under ochratoxin A production conditions, a large part of the celluar phenylalanine might apparently be shifted to the ochratoxin A biosyn-thetic pathway. In the present study, we observed induction of a phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase. According to these results, it can be assumed that the organism tries to ensure that enough phenyl-alanine-tRNA is available for protein biosynthesis under ochratoxin A biosynthesis conditions, by upregulating the phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase gene. ABC transporter genes are also induced during ochratoxin A production. It was discussed by An-trade et al. (2000) that these ABC transporters are needed for the export of secondary metabolites, Table 1. (Continued) including mycotoxins. The observed upregulation of genes for ABC transporters supports this view. A putative DNA binding protein is up-regulated under ochratoxin A production conditions. My-cotoxin biosynthetic pathways are usually con-trolled by transcription factors, like the aflR protein in the case of aflatoxin (Ehrlich and Cary, 1995) or the tri6 and tri10 genes in the case of the trichothecenes (Peplow et al., 2003). For this rea-son, the identified DNA binding protein might be involved in the induction of the genes for ochra-toxin A biosynthesis. However, further experiments are needed to show whether the identified DNA binding protein is indeed involved in ochratoxin A biosynthesis or is up-regulated because of the presence of different carbon and nitrogen sources. Other genes which have been identified using this approach are apparently up-regulated due to the growth in different media. For both media the same basal composition of nutrients were used, only the nitrogen and carbon sources were ex-changed. The non-inducing medium contained potassium nitrate and glucose and the inducing medium contained ammonium chloride and glyc-erol. It is noteworthy that two genes of ammonium metabolism, a gene with homology to an ammo-nium monooxygenase and a gene with homology to an ammonium transporter, were up-regulated under ochratoxin A inducing conditions. In par-ticular the homologue of the former gene is present in nitrifying bacteria and is responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine. Fungi assimilate NH\u00fe4 via glutamic acid and usually do not oxidize ammonium. Thus the role of this putative gene is currently not known. Surprisingly, the sequence from this DDRT-PCR fragment seems to be specific for ochratoxinogenic Penicil-lia. It has also been possible to develop a primer pair from this sequence, which gave a positive PCR signal with ochratoxinogenic Penicillia, such as P. nordicum and P. verrucosum, but not with other food related filamentous fungi including the ochratoxinogenic Aspergilli (data not shown). The other genes which are apparently up-regu-lated because of the differences in the carbon source, are acetyl-CoA synthetase, NADH dehy-drogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase. The upregluation of the acetyl-CoA synthetase might also be correlated to ochratoxin A biosynthesis, as acetyl-CoA serves as a precursor for polyketide biosynthesis. Inhibition of ochratoxin A by glucose contrasts with the biosynthesis of aflatoxin by Aspergilli. Luchese and Harrigan (1993) reported that glucose and glycerol are excellent carbon sources for growth and aflatoxin production by A. parasiticus. In the case of ochratoxin A, glycerol supports, but glucose inhibits, toxin production. Inhibition of synthesis of penicillin by glucose was also observed with A. nidulans (Brakhage et al., 1992), indicating that glucose indeed has an influence on secondary metabolite biosynthesis. On the other hand, regu-lation by the nitrogen source seems to be similar for aflatoxin and ochratoxin A biosynthesis. Aflatoxin production by A. flavus and A. parasit-icus is also reduced after growth in nitrate-based medium and increased in ammonium salt-based medium (Ehrlich and Cotty, 2002). Feng and Leonhard (1998) suggested that the reduced levels of aflatoxin were caused by nitrate suppression of aflR, the regulatory gene of the aflatoxin biosyn-thetic pathway. We also observed that a putative DNA-binding protein was down-regulated when nitrate was present and up-regulated after growth in ammonium containing medium. This might be a further indication that this putative regulatory protein is involved in ochratoxin A biosynthesis. In the present study, the induction of genes as-sumed to be involved in ochratoxin A biosynthesis has been monitored. It was shown that the DDRT-PCR approach is feasible for generating an overall picture of up-regulated genes during ochratoxin A production. Moreover the isolated DDRT-PCR fragments can serve as gene probes for the isolation of the whole genes. Further detailed analysis of these genes, which is now possible, should provide more detailed insights into the genetic regulation of ochratoxin A biosynthesis in Penicillia.

        "Analysis of differentially expressed genes under conditions which favour ochratoxin A production by Penicillium nordicum was carried out by Differential Display Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (DDRT-PCR). The differential conditions were achieved by growth on different minimal media which either support or inhibit ochratoxin A production. Thirty differentially expressed genes were identified. The DDRT-PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced. The sequences obtained were analysed for homology at the protein level by GeneBank comparison. This analysis revealed several fragments with homology to enzymes which are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of ochratoxin A, in particular a polyketide synthase, a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, a halogenase, a phenylalanine t-RNA synthetase, a methylase and a fragment with homology to ABC transporter genes. All other induced genes either showed no homology to known sequences or are genes whose induction can be explained by growth in different minimal media.",

        "Ochratoxin A is an important mycotoxin which can occur in different food commodities such as cereals, coffee, wine, beer and spices (Ho\u0308hler, 1998). Ochratoxin A is nephrotoxic with additional teratogenic and immunogenic effects (Petzinger and Ziegler, 2000). It is classified as a carcinogen and for that reason the occurrence of ochratoxin A in plant products produced for human nutrition has to be minimised. In regions with a temperate climate Penicillium species are mainly responsible for the production of ochratoxin A in cereals and cereal products. In warmer regions, Aspergillus species such as A. ochraceus, A. carbonarius or A. niger are responsible for the presence of ochratoxin A in products such as coffee (Bucheli et al., 2000; Joosten et al., 2001), spices (Thirumala-Devi et al., 2002) and wine (Pietri et al., 2001; Cabanes et al., 2002; Da Rocha Rosa et al., 2002). Until recently, P. verrucosum was the only species of the genus Penicillium which had been shown to produce ochratoxin A. Detailed analyses at the biochemical (Larsen et al., 2001) and genetic levels (Castella et al., 2002), however, revealed that two closely related but distinct species, namely P. verrucosum and P. nordicum, were able to produce ochratoxin A. Penicillium verrucosum occurs mainly on cereals and is responsible for the production of ochratoxin A in this food commodity, whereas P. nordicum is a contaminant of protein-rich foods such as cheeses and meat products.",

        "the biosynthetic pathway according to results of Harris and Mantle (2001). Much less is known about the genetic background of ochratoxin A biosynthesis. According to the proposed biosyn-thetic pathway, the minimal requirements at the genetic level are genes for a polyketide synthase, required for the synthesis of the polyketide dihy-dro-isocoumarin, a methylase for the formation of the carboxyl group, an ochratoxin A synthase (peptide synthetase) for ligation of the amino acid phenylalanine and the polyketide, and finally a chloroperoxidase or halogenase for the introduc-tion of the chlorine atom. In a recent report, the putative polyketide synthase from P. nordicum has been partly characterised (Geisen et al., in press) and its expression was correlated to ochratoxin A production.

        "The Differential Display Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (DDRT-PCR) approach was first described by Liang and Pardee (1992) for use in plants. In the meantime, this approach has also been adapted to identify differentially expressed genes in fungi. Benito et al. (1996) used this method to identify genes which are up-regulated during plant-fungus interactions. Melin et al. (1999) analysed changes in gene expression in Aspergillus nidulans due to the presence of the antibiotic bafilomycin. To use the DDRT-PCR approach for the analysis of genes differentially expressed during ochratoxin A biosynthesis, two different RNA populations were compared. One RNA population was isolated under conditions which did not support the pro-duction of ochratoxin A and the other RNA population was isolated under ochratoxin A-pro-ducing conditions. In this paper we report the identification of differentially expressed genes of P. nordicum by DDRT-PCR under conditions which support ochratoxin A production.",

        "Ochratoxin A production by Penicillium nordicum on different media",
        "To identify growth conditions which either sup-port or inhibit ochratoxin A production by P. nordicum without influencing other pathways or genes, a minimal medium which contained the basic nutrients was varied in its composition. In experiments with media in which only one of the basic nutrients was exchanged, KNO3 and glucose inhibited toxin production, whereas NH4Cl and glycerol supported ochratoxin A biosynthesis (data not shown). For the experiments described, the inhibitory or supporting nutrients were used in combination to enhance this effect. As a result, it was possible to adjust supporting and inhibiting conditions by just changing two basic nutrients, in particular the carbon and nitrogen sources. The minimal medium which contained glucose and KNO3 proved to be inhibitory for ochratoxin A production, whereas the same minimal medium supplemented with glycerol and NH4Cl supported ochratoxin A production. This was clearly dem-onstrated by thin layer chromatography (Figure 2). The growth rates were nearly unaf-fected in both media compared to the routinely used complex media (Figure 3), indicating that the change in the medium composition specifically influences ochratoxin A biosynthesis and not general growth behaviour.",
        "Analysis of differentially expressed genes under ochratoxin A production conditions by DDRT-PCR",
        "Cultures of P. nordicum were grown for 4 days under shaking conditions and the mycelium was harvested. The total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed and subjected to DDRT-PCR with different sets of anchored and random primers. An example of the results is shown in Figure 4. Genes which are up-regulated under ochratoxin A production conditions were highlighted by this method (Figure 4, arrow). In total, 30 upregulated genes were identified under ochratoxin A-produc-",

The sequences of the DDRT-PCR frag-ments were translated into the protein sequence and compared to published sequences in the GeneBank database by BLAST searches. The homologies found are listed in Table 1. Several of the identified fragments had homologies to genes postulated for the ochratoxin A biosynthetic pathway, in particular a polyketide synthase (3 fragments), a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (2 fragments), an phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase (1 fragment), a methyl transferase (1 fragment), a halogenase (1 fragment) and ABC transporter genes related to secondary metabolism (1 frag-ment). Other upregulated genes are house-keeping genes and appear to be induced by growth in dif-ferent media, in the same way as the up-regulation of membrane channel proteins, enzymes of the citrate cycle, putative transcription factors, trans-lation elongation factor, genes of ammonium metabolism and several ribosomal proteins. The results obtained by this DDRT-PCR approach are conclusive under these growth conditions.",
        "Discussion",
        "Very little is known about the genetics of ochra-toxin A biosynthesis in Aspergillus or Penicillium. Recently a polyketide synthase was characterised and it was expressed in relation to ochratoxin A biosynthesis (Geisen et al., in press). In the de-scribed DDRT-PCR analysis, fragments with homology to polyketide synthase (pks) genes were identified, supporting the observation that a pks gene is induced under conditions where ochratoxin",
        "Figure 3. Comparison of mycelial growth on both minimal",
        "Table 1. Homology of sequenced DDRT-PCR fragments at the protein level",
        "A is produced. Homologues of genes of many as-sumed enzymes for ochratoxin A biosynthesis were identified. A non-ribosomal peptide synthase was induced under ochratoxin A production condi-tions. This might be the postulated ochratoxin A synthetase (Huff and Hamilton, 1979) which completes the peptide coupling of the amino acid phenylalanine to the polyketide dihydro-isocoum-arin. In addition, the induction of a methyl transferase was observed. Ochratoxin A is a methylated compound (Harris and Mantle, 2001). According to the suggested pathway (Huff and Hamilton, 1979) the polyketide is methylated and the methyl group is further oxidised to the car-boxyl group, which is involved in the peptide bond to the amino acid phenylalanine (Figure 1). The methylation inhibitor ethionine completely inhibits the production of ochratoxin A, indicating the importance of these enzymatic activities (Yama-zaki et al., 1971). A gene with homology to an halogenase is also induced during ochratoxin A biosynthesis. Kirner et al. (1998) described an halogenase responsible for the chlorination of L-tryptophane during the biosynthesis of pyrrolni-trin, a secondary metabolite with antifungal activity produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. The halogenase homologue identified in this study might be responsible for the chlorination of och-ratoxin B to ochratoxin A (Huff and Hamilton, 1979).",
        "During ochratoxin A biosynthesis, the meta-bolic flux of phenylalanine is re-routed from pro-tein biosynthesis to ochratoxin A biosynthesis. The analysed strain of P. nordicum is a very strong ochratoxin A-producing organism. If this strain grows under ochratoxin A production conditions, a large part of the celluar phenylalanine might apparently be shifted to the ochratoxin A biosyn-thetic pathway. In the present study, we observed induction of a phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase. According to these results, it can be assumed that the organism tries to ensure that enough phenyl-alanine-tRNA is available for protein biosynthesis under ochratoxin A biosynthesis conditions, by upregulating the phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase gene.",
        "ABC transporter genes are also induced during ochratoxin A production. It was discussed by An-trade et al. (2000) that these ABC transporters are needed for the export of secondary metabolites,",
        "Table 1. (Continued)",
        "including mycotoxins. The observed upregulation of genes for ABC transporters supports this view.",
        "A putative DNA binding protein is up-regulated under ochratoxin A production conditions. My-cotoxin biosynthetic pathways are usually con-trolled by transcription factors, like the aflR protein in the case of aflatoxin (Ehrlich and Cary, 1995) or the tri6 and tri10 genes in the case of the trichothecenes (Peplow et al., 2003). For this rea-son, the identified DNA binding protein might be involved in the induction of the genes for ochra-toxin A biosynthesis. However, further experiments are needed to show whether the identified DNA binding protein is indeed involved in ochratoxin A biosynthesis or is up-regulated because of the presence of different carbon and nitrogen sources.",
        "Other genes which have been identified using this approach are apparently up-regulated due to the growth in different media. For both media the same basal composition of nutrients were used, only the nitrogen and carbon sources were ex-changed. The non-inducing medium contained potassium nitrate and glucose and the inducing medium contained ammonium chloride and glyc-erol. It is noteworthy that two genes of ammonium metabolism, a gene with homology to an ammo-nium monooxygenase and a gene with homology to an ammonium transporter, were up-regulated under ochratoxin A inducing conditions. In par-ticular the homologue of the former gene is present in nitrifying bacteria and is responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine. Fungi assimilate NH\u00fe4 via glutamic acid and usually do not oxidize ammonium. Thus the role of this putative gene is currently not known. Surprisingly, the sequence from this DDRT-PCR fragment seems to be specific for ochratoxinogenic Penicil-lia. It has also been possible to develop a primer pair from this sequence, which gave a positive PCR signal with ochratoxinogenic Penicillia, such as P. nordicum and P. verrucosum, but not with other food related filamentous fungi including the ochratoxinogenic Aspergilli (data not shown).",
        "The other genes which are apparently up-regu-lated because of the differences in the carbon source, are acetyl-CoA synthetase, NADH dehy-drogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase. The upregluation of the acetyl-CoA synthetase might also be correlated to ochratoxin A biosynthesis, as acetyl-CoA serves as a precursor for polyketide biosynthesis.",
        "Inhibition of ochratoxin A by glucose contrasts with the biosynthesis of aflatoxin by Aspergilli. Luchese and Harrigan (1993) reported that glucose and glycerol are excellent carbon sources for growth and aflatoxin production by A. parasiticus. In the case of ochratoxin A, glycerol supports, but glucose inhibits, toxin production. Inhibition of synthesis of penicillin by glucose was also observed with A. nidulans (Brakhage et al., 1992), indicating that glucose indeed has an influence on secondary metabolite biosynthesis. On the other hand, regu-lation by the nitrogen source seems to be similar for aflatoxin and ochratoxin A biosynthesis. Aflatoxin production by A. flavus and A. parasit-icus is also reduced after growth in nitrate-based medium and increased in ammonium salt-based medium (Ehrlich and Cotty, 2002). Feng and Leonhard (1998) suggested that the reduced levels of aflatoxin were caused by nitrate suppression of aflR, the regulatory gene of the aflatoxin biosyn-thetic pathway. We also observed that a putative DNA-binding protein was down-regulated when nitrate was present and up-regulated after growth in ammonium containing medium. This might be a further indication that this putative regulatory protein is involved in ochratoxin A biosynthesis.",
        "In the present study, the induction of genes as-sumed to be involved in ochratoxin A biosynthesis has been monitored. It was shown that the DDRT-PCR approach is feasible for generating an overall picture of up-regulated genes during ochratoxin A production. Moreover the isolated DDRT-PCR fragments can serve as gene probes for the isolation of the whole genes. Further detailed analysis of these genes, which is now possible, should provide more detailed insights into the genetic regulation of ochratoxin A biosynthesis in Penicillia.",
