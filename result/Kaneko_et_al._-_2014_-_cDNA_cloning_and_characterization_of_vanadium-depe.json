The cDNAs for two Laurencia nipponica vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases (LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme assays of recombinant LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 using monochlorodimedone revealed that they were thermolabile but their Km values for Br -were sig-nificantly lower than other red algal VBPOs. The bromination reaction was also assessed using laure-diol, the predicted natural precursor of the bromi-nated ether laurencin. Laurediol, protected by trimethylsilyl at the enyne, was converted to deace-tyllaurencin by the LnVBPOs, which was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. Native LnVBPO par-tially purified from algal bodies was active, suggest-ing that LnVBPO is functional in vivo. These results contributed to our knowledge of the biosynthesis of Laurencia brominated metabolites. Key words: vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase; Laurencia; laurencin; acetogenins; bio-synthesis Since the pioneering work on the isolation of the brominated compound laurencin (1) from the red alga Laurencia nipponica,1,2) many halogenated compounds, mostly brominated compounds, have been reported from algae. To date, more than 600 metabolites have been identified from Laurencia spp. with several diverse and unique carbon skeletons, including C15 ace-togenins, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and triterpe-noids.3) It is known that some of these compounds show cytotoxicity and antibacterial activitiy.3) Hence, Laurencia metabolites are potentially useful for phar-maceutical applications. Despite the increasing number of reports of halogenated compounds isolated from Laurencia spp., studies on the biosynthesis of these halogenated compounds are limited. The leading work focused on the bromination step of the C15 acetogenins of Laurencia spp., in particular 1. These early studies achieved the enzymatic bromination of the deduced precursor of 1, laurediol (2),4) using commercially available lactoperoxidase (LPO) or par-tially purified bromoperoxidase (BPO) from L. nippo-nica.5,6) These first studies also achieved the enzymatic synthesis of a final precursor of 1, deacetyllaurencin (3) (Scheme 1). Although the yields of this synthesis were low (1 mg from 73.8 mg using LPO, 0.02 mg from 101 mg using BPO), the studies suggested that LPO-or BPO-like activities could catalyze the bromin-ation of Laurencia metabolites. BPO from L. nipponica has been only partially puri-fied,6) and its structural and biochemical information have remained largely unknown. On the other hand, BPOs have been isolated from other algae, and most of these BPOs have been identified as vanadium-depen-dent bromoperoxidases (VBPOs) that require vanadate (VO3None4 ) as cofactor. 7-14) Therefore, we cloned and expressed VBPOs from L. nipponica to clarify the bromination step of second-ary metabolites in Laurencia spp. Evaluation of the activities of the VBPOs was conducted using a surrogate compound and a physiologically relevant precursor. Materials and methods RNA preparation. L. nipponica Yamada was col-lected in December 2009 at Oshoro-bay (Hokkaido, Japan) 15) and was kindly shared by Dr T. Abe (The Hokkaido University Museum). The algal bodies were stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) followed by disruption of algal bodies (1 g) into pow-der in liquid nitrogen. Poly (A)+ RNA was purified using the OligotexTM-dT30 < Super > mRNA purifica-tion kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan). *Corresponding author.

Double stranded cDNA (dscDNA) was synthesized from Poly (A)+ RNA with the SuperscriptTM Plasmid System with Gateway Technology for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For rapid amplifica-tion of cDNA ends (RACE PCR), adaptor sequences were attached to dscDNA with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Takara). The primer pair for 5\u2032-RACE was AP1 (Marathon kit) and Rv1 (5\u2032-GCCGGCATCA-AAGAACGCCTTGAG-3\u2032). For 3\u2032-RACE, the primer pair was AP1 and Fw1 (5\u2032-CAGTAGTGGACAGTG-ACTTGC-3\u2032). Fw1 and Rv1 were designed by referring to the VBPO cDNA sequences of the red alga Porphyra yezoensis (the accession number AU187606, AU189808, and AU196993),16) which were retrieved from the open EST database of Kazusa DNA Research Institution (Chiba, Japan). Takara Ex Taq. (Takara) was utilized for RACE PCR under the following conditions: 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, 28 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 54 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a final elonga-tion at 72 \u00b0C for 3 min. After verifying the presence of the PCR products by 1.0% TBE agarose gel electro-phoresis, PCR products were excised with the QIA-quick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Plasmids were transformed into DH5\u03b1 E. coli cells and purified with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) for nucleotide sequencing. Finally, two cDNA sequences encoding VBPO-like proteins, LnVBPO1 (AB830711) and LnVBPO2 (AB847108), were obtained. The cDNA sequences were subjected to alignment and phylogenic analysis using BioEdit 17) and FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software). Mono-mer structure models of LnVBPOs were predicted by SWISS-MODEL.18-20) Predicted models were visual-ized with PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/). Construction of gene expression plasmids. DNA inserts were prepared by PCR using primer sets with a NdeI site on the start codon and a BamHI site after the stop codon, respectively (LnVBPO1_Ex_Fw: 5\u2032-CAT-ACACATATGGACCACTACACTCACGTT-3\u2032 and LnVB-PO1_Ex_Rv: 5\u2032-TTAACATTGGGATCCATATCTAATT-CGAAT-3\u2032, LnVBPO2_Ex_Fw: 5\u2032-CCCACCCATATGG-AACACTACACTCACATC-3\u2032 and LnVBPO2_Ex_Rv: 5\u2032-AGCCTACATGGATCCCTACAAGTCACGGC-3\u2032). KOD polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was utilized for PCR amplification under the following conditions: 94 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 56 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 2min. The PCR products were excised from a 1.0% TBE agarose gel and digested with NdeI and BamHI. The digested products were then introduced into the corresponding sites of pET21a or pET15b vectors (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). pET21a was used for expression of the untagged LnVBPOs (LnVBPOs) and the C-terminal 6 \u00d7His tagged (LnVBPOs-C) proteins. pET15b was used for the N-terminal 6 \u00d7His tagged (LnVBPOs-N) proteins. Expression plasmids of LnVBPOs-C were constructed from the plasmids of untagged LnVBPOs by conversion the 3\u2032-terminal regions as follows. First, PCR amplification of the 3\u2032-terminal region was conducted using a primer set designed to amplify upstream of the SalI site of LnVBPO1 (LnVBPO1_Fw2: 5\u2032-AACACA-CAGATGGACCGTGATA-3\u2032) or the ClaI site of LnVBPO2 (LnVBPO2_Fw2: 5\u2032-CACCGTCGCCGGG-GCGTGCACAA-3\u2032), and the 3\u2032-terminal region of LnVBPOs. The 3\u2032-terminal primers were designed to replace the stop codon with XhoI (LnVBPO1_3t: 5\u2032-ACGCTCGAGCACCGTCACGCAACTGC-3\u2032 and Ln-VBPO2_3t: 5\u2032-AAACTCGAGCGCACGTGCCATCAA-AC-3\u2032) and amplified using Takara Ex Taq polymerase as described above. The PCR products were digested with SalI and XhoI or ClaI and XhoI and were then used to replace the corresponding regions of the original LnVBPO constructs. All expression plasmids were electroporated into the E. coli expression strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Takara). Purification of recombinant LnVBPO proteins. Heterologous expression of LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 was conducted similarly to the experiments conducted with Corallina pilulifera and C. officinalis.10,11,21) Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS were inoculated in 1 L of Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium (1%) containing 50 \u03bcg/mL of carbenicillin disodium salt and incubated until mid log phase at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (120 rpm). The expression of recombinant protein was induced by adding 0.4 mM IPTG at 25 \u00b0C. After 3 h, the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 \u00d7 g, 15 min). The pellet was suspended into the \u201cbasic buffer\u201d of this study, consisting of 50 mM Tris-SO4 (pH 8.0) and 1 mM NH4VO3, and the cells were disrupted with a sonicator. After exclusion of cell deb-ris by centrifugation (15,000 \u00d7 g, 15 min), the obtained supernatant was subjected to 30% saturation of ammo-nium sulfate for precipitation, while stirring overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After ammonium sulfate precipitation, centrifu-gation (9,000 \u00d7 g, 30 min) was performed to recover the supernatant. The supernatant was dialyzed against the basic buffer and then subjected to DE52 anion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, Bucking-hamshire, UK). A series of KBr solutions (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.8 M) in the basic buffer were prepared for stepwise elution. After washing the column with the basic buffer, stepwise elution was started. The eluted fractions were monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm and checked by 10% SDS-PAGE under reduc-ing conditions (2-mercaptoethanol, 2ME+) according to Laemmli.22) LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 were eluted with 0.4 and 0.8M KBr, respectively. Peak fractions of LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 were concentrated after dial-ysis against the basic buffer. Protein concentrations were quantified by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Purified LnVBPO pro-teins were stored at 4 \u00b0C. The 6 \u00d7 His tagged recombi-nant proteins of LnVBPOs were prepared similarly until the recovery of cell lysates. The soluble fraction after the sonication step was subjected to Ni-NTA puri-fication (Invitrogen). Purification of algal BPO native protein and peptide sequence analysis. Algal bodies of L. nipponica Yamada were collected in July 2011 at Oshoro-bay Vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases from Laurencia nipponica 1311 D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /bbb/article/78/8/1310/5939738 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June (Hokkaido, Japan).15) After washing with autoclaved seawater, algal bodies were immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Algal bodies (wet weight of 185 g) were homogenized with a mixer in 600 mL of 50 mM Tris-SO4 (pH 8.0). Homogenized samples were filtered through cheese cloth and centrifuged (6,000 \u00d7 g, 20 min). The supernatant was subjected to purification of native BPO. The method used for recombinant LnVBPO purification was also used for native BPO purification. Proteins with the highest BPO activities eluted in the 0.3 and 0.4 M KBr fractions of DE52 and were subsequently dialyzed against the basic buffer. Partially purified BPO was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE (2ME+). The Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB)-stained bands were excised from the gel, and trypsin-digested peptide fragments were prepared using the In-Gel Tryptic Digestion Kit (Thermo Scientific). The peptides were desalted using ZipTip C18 filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and subjected to na-noLC\u2013MS/MS analysis. EASY-nLC and LTQ Orbitrap Discovery (Thermo Scientific) were used for this exper-iment. The elution conditions were as follows, using an EASY-Column C18-A2 (10 cm, ID 75 \u03bcm) (Thermo Scientific): linear gradients of 5\u201335% MeCN, 0.1% HCOOH (0\u201310 min) and 35\u2013100% MeCN, 0.1% HOOH (10\u201312 min) and an isocratic of 100% MeCN, 0.1% HCOOH (12\u201320 min), at a flow rate of 300 nL/ min. Recorded MS/MS fragments were subjected to the analyzing software, Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Sci-entific), and MASCOT was used for protein identifica-tion. Enzyme assay. BPO activity was assayed spectro-photometrically at 25 \u00b0C by measuring the decrease in the absorbance at 290 nm upon bromination of mono-chlorodimedone (MCD, \u025b = 19.9 mM-1 cm-1, pH 6.0) to monobromo-monochlorodimedone. The standard condition was 50 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 200 mM KBr, 50 \u03bcM MCD, and 1 mM H2O2. 23) One unit (U) was defined as the conversion of 1 \u03bcmol of MCD per minute. MCD was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). The pH dependency was tested by performing the MCD assay at different reaction pH val-ues (pH 4.0 to 6.0 adjusted by 50 mM MES-NaOH, and pH 7.0 to 9.0 adjusted by 50 mM Tris-HCl). The optimum pH was defined as the reaction pH at which the observed activity was the highest. The thermal stability of the LnVBPOs was analyzed using the stan-dard assay conditions, after treatment of the enzymes at various temperatures (25\u201375 \u00b0C) for 20 min, by com-paring the activity at each temperature with that of 25 \u00b0C. For tolerance to polar organic solvents, each organic solvent was added to the MCD reaction mix-ture at a final concentration of 40% (v/v). The chlorina-tion activities were detected at 1.5 M KCl with VBPOs from the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum 24) and the red alga C. pilulifera.25) Then, chlorination activities with LnVBPOs were tested at 1.5 M,24,25) 1 M, 100 and 10 mM KCl (99.5% purity of KCl) instead of KBr. In addition, chlorination was detected at pH 4.5 for the VBPO from C. officinalis,26) the assays at each concen-tration of KCl were conducted at pH 6.0 and 4.5.26) Steady-state kinetic experiments were operated by vary-ing the concentration of one of the substrates (0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, and 1 mM H2O2 or 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mM KBr), while fixing the concentration of the second substrate at a saturating concentration (200 mM KBr to determine the Km for H2O2, 1 mM H2O2 to determine the Km for Br -). Before conducting the kinetic experiment for Br-, the KBr concentration which shows the highest activity at minimum concen-tration was explored and set at 2.5 mM KBr. The kinetic experiments were performed at pH 6.0 to com-pare the Km values to the other red algae. Km values were derived from non-linear fitting to initial rate data using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). LnVBPOs were used for enzyme assays after dialysis against the basic buffer to ensure the coordination of vanadate into the V center. Bromination of laurediol. To assess the ability of recombinant LnVBPOs to brominate the putative pre-cursor of laurencin (1), we conducted in vitro bromina-tion for putative precursor of 1, (3E, 6R, 7R)-laurediol (2). Fukuzawa et al. reported that (3E, 6R, 7R)-2 is highly unstable,5) and 101 mg of 2 added to the enzy-matic reaction produces only 0.02 mg of the expected reaction product.6) Hence, we utilized a relatively stable derivative of (3E, 6R, 7R)-2, trimethylsilyl (TMS)-capped (3E, 6R, 7R)-laurediol (4). Compound 4 was prepared according to the same procedures utilized by Fukuzawa et al.: successive alkaline hydrolysis, silyla-tion, and reduction with Zn metal of 1 (Supplemental Scheme 1).5) Scheme 1. Enzymatic bromination and cyclization of Laurencia brominated C15 acetogenin. The enzymatic reaction was performed under an argon gas atmosphere. Compound 4 (4.8 mg) was dis-solved in a small volume of EtOH and added to 63 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.1) containing 5 mM KBr. Recombinant LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 (approximately 100 \u03bcg) were added to the mixture to make a final vol-ume of 9 mL. As a negative control, the reaction was also conducted in the absence of the enzyme. The reaction was started by intermittently adding 1 mL of 2 mM H2O2 for 1 h using a syringe. The reaction was conducted at 25 \u00b0C for 24 h in the dark with gentle agitation. After 24 h, the reaction products in the solu-ble fraction of ethyl acetate were analyzed by LC\u2013MS/ MS (LTQ Orbitrap Discovery). YMC Pack Pro C18 (2.0 \u00d7 150 mm) (YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) was selected as the analytical column. The elution condition was a linear gradient of 50\u2013100% MeCN in water (0\u201320 min) followed by 100% MeCN (20\u201330 min), at a flow rate of 300 \u03bcL/min. Results cDNA cloning and expression of LnVBPOs Two types of VBPO cDNAs were obtained from L. nipponica by RACE PCR. Sequence analysis showed that the cDNAs encoded open reading frames of 643 (LnVBPO1) and 651 (LnVBPO2) amino acids. The Fig. 1. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of red algal VBPOs from L. nipponica (LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2), C. pilulifera (CpVBPO1 and CpVBPO2), and C. officinalis (CoVBPO). Notes.

The arrow shows substitution of Ser to Ala in LnVBPOs (Ala530 and Ala538 in LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2). The fragment sequences acquired from the algal BPO using nanoLC\u2013MS/MS are underlined (Table 1). The dashed line is the LnVBPOs specific Gln rich insertion. Accession No. of VBPO from each Corallina spp. is BAA31261 for CpVBPO1, BAA31262 for CpVBPO2, and AAM46061 for CoVBPO. Accession Nos. for LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 are AB830711 and AB847108, respectively. Vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases from Laurencia nipponica 1313 D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /bbb/article/78/8/1310/5939738 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June amino acid sequence identity of these two enzymes was 95%. According to sequence alignment analysis, LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 contained most of the amino acid residues essential for the V center of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO), including the His residue that covalently binds to vanadate and other resi-dues responsible for hydrogen bonding in the active site. In addition, conserved VBPO-specific His residues were identified (Fig. 1).7,8) The recombinant LnVBPOs without tags were puri-fied by ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography. By SDS-PAGE under reduc-ing conditions (2ME+), the purified proteins migrated as single bands at approximately 77 kDa (Fig. 2). This apparent mass is slightly greater than the theoretical molecular mass of LnVBPO1 (71.02 kDa) and LnVBPO2 (71.12 kDa). Recombinant LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 had high bromination activities of 265 and 275 U/mg protein for MCD, respectively (Table 2). When the recombinant proteins carrying 6 \u00d7 His tags were assayed under the same conditions, these enzymes exhibited significantly reduced bromination activities; 0.7% (LnVBPO1-N), 0.3% (LnVBPO2-N), 0.1% (LnVBPO1-C), and 0.3% (LnVBPO2-C) of the activities of the corresponding untagged LnVBPOs. Therefore, the untagged LnVBPO proteins were used for further experiments. Purification of BPO from L. nipponica BPO was partially purified from algal bodies of L. nipponica. The partially purified enzyme also migrated around 77 kDa (72 kDa) on a 10% SDS-PAGE reduc-ing (2ME+) gel, and additional bands were observed near 18 kDa (Fig. 3). The partially purified algal BPO (72 kDa) had slightly lower molecular mass than those of recombinant LnVBPOs (77 kDa). This difference of 5 kDa might be caused by the effects of the existence of other protein(s) around 72\u201377 kDa or degradation during the concentration of algal BPO. By peptide frag-ment analysis using nanoLC\u2013MS/MS, the 77 kDa pro-tein (c in Fig. 3) was indeed identified as LnVBPO1 (22.4% coverage). The protein at 72 kDa (a in Fig. 3) purified from algal bodies contained partial sequences that were identical to LnVBPOs (6.22% sequence cov-erage) (Fig. 1). The other band at 18 kDa (b in Fig. 3) was identified as R-phycoerythrin \u03b1 chain (15.85% coverage) (Table 1). The lower sequence coverage of partially purified algal BPO (6.22%) compared to recombinant LnVBPO1 (22.4%) might be due to sub-types of BPO or other unknown proteins in the 72 kDa band. The bromination activity of purified algal BPO was estimated to 33 U/mg protein for MCD, which was lower than the activity of recombinant LnVBPOs (265 in LnVBPO1 and 275 U/mg protein in LnVBPO2) (Table 2). Another difference compared with recombi-nant LnVBPOs was reduced stability at 4 \u00b0C. The par-tially purified BPO was rapidly inactivated within 1 week. Bromination activity of LnVBPOs The bromination activity of the recombinant LnVBPOs was evaluated using MCD under different conditions. In the pH-rate profile, the maximum activi-ties of LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 were observed at pH 7.0, and the activities were not detected at pH 4.0 (Table 2, Supplemental Fig. 2). The activities of both LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 declined when treated at 55 and 65 \u00b0C, and were inactive at 65 and 75 \u00b0C, respec-tively (Table 2, Supplemental Fig. 2). When the assay was conducted in the existence of polar organic sol-vents (40% v/v), LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 showed some degree of tolerance except in the presence of ace-tone (Fig. 4). These experiments indicate that the enzy-matic properties of LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 are similar, but LnVBPO2 appears to be more stable than Fig. 2. SDS-PAGE (10%) under reducing conditions (2ME+) of purified LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2. Notes: The marker (M) used was the precision plus protein stan-dards (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The lanes are labeled 1 and 2 to denote purified LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2, respectively. The puri-fied protein migrated to approximately 77 kDa. Fig. 3.

The 72 kDa band (a), 18 kDa band (b), and c band were excised from the gel and subjected to peptide sequencing using nanoLC\u2013MS/MS (Table 1). 1314 K. Kaneko et al.

The Km for H2O2 was 0.026 mM for LnVBPO1 and 0.025 mM for LnVBPO2, and the Km for Br-was 0.53 mM for LnVBPO1 and 0.35 mM for LnVBPO2 at pH 6.0 (Table 2). The inhibitory effect of KBr for the MCD bromination activities of LnVBPOs was observed above 50 mM KBr. Chlorination activity was not detected using LnVBPO1 or LnVBPO2 at any KCl concentration tested (10 mM, 100 mM, 1M, and 1.5M). Bromination of laurediol We synthesized TMS-capped (3E, 6R, 7R)-laurediol (4) that is a stable form of (3E, 6R, 7R)-laurediol (2), using laurencin (1) as a starting material. We then added compound 4 to a small-scale enzyme reaction because compound 2 was highly unstable and it was difficult to prepare a large amount of 2 from the algal bodies.5) By LC\u2013MS analysis, a Table 1.

The hydrate of the expected compound ([M + H3O] +), m/z 403.1294 and 405.1271, was specifically observed at 8.44 min in the samples containing enzyme. Since LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 provided the same results, the results are shown only for LnVBPO1. The control is absence of enzyme in the reaction. 1316 K. Kaneko et al.

These mass spectra were not observed in the negative control reaction (in the absence of the enzyme). The LC\u2013MS/MS fragment pattern of m/z 403.1294 was obtained and compared to that of deacetyllauren-cin (3). Although the MS/MS spectra did not completely match due to the existence of TMS, most of the fragments showed the same pattern as those of 3 such as m/z 295.0678 [M\u2013TMS\u2013OH]+ (\u0394\u20133.1 mDa), 255.0356 [M\u2013TMS\u2013C2H2 (enyne)\u2013OH\u2013CH3] + (\u0394\u20132.8 mDa), 233.1516 [M\u2013TMS\u2013Br]+ (\u0394\u20132.5 mDa), 215.1412 [M\u2013TMS\u2013OH\u2013Br]+ (\u0394\u20132.4 mDa), and 197.1306. In particular, the m/z of 313.0772 coin-cided with the [M+H]+ of 3 (\u0394\u20132.0 mDa) and was also present as a fragment of m/z 403.1294 (Fig. 6). Upon further fragmentation of m/z 313.0772, the fragment pattern was almost identical to that of 3 below m/z 305.1901 (data not shown). Therefore, the pair at m/z 403.1294 and 405.1271 may correspond to desired product 5. These results suggest that LnVBPOs catalyzed the bromination and cyclization of (3E, 6R, 7R)-2 to form 3. Discussion cDNAs encoding VBPO were cloned from L. nippo-nica. The primary sequences of LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 are similar and are predicted to contain the His residue that binds V in the active site (His598 and His606 in LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2, respectively). The Gln-rich stretches (Gln494\u2013508 in LnVBPO1, Gln494\u2013 515 in LnVBPO2) (Fig. 1) are distinct features of the L. nipponica haloperoxidases compared with other reported algal VBPOs. In addition, the Ser residue Fig. 6. Comparison of MS/MS fragment patterns of deacetyllaurencin (3) and the enzymatic products. Notes: (A) MS/MS fragment of 3. (B) MS/MS fragment of m/z 403, which was enzymatically produced from 4 (Fig. 5). The fragments were obtained under the same conditions. The spectra of A and B had many identical signals such as m/z 295, 255, 233, 215, and 197 (blue arrows). The prediction of the fragmentation was drawn in (C). Symbol \u0394 denotes the difference between the observed mass and calculated exact mass. Dif-ferent intensity patterns between (A) and (B) might be caused by the different precursor ions. In B, a signal appeared with the same m/z value as the [M + H]+ ion of 3 (313).

Phylogenetic anal-ysis showed that the LnVBPOs are branched in a clus-ter of the red algal VBPOs, such as VBPOs from C. officinalis and C. pilulifera (approximately 40% identi-ties), and Gracilaria changii (46% identity).27) Notably, VBPOs from the marine cyanobacteria Synechococcus spp. CC9311 and WH8020 clustered with red algal VBPOs (Supplemental Fig. 1). This clustering might be the result of horizontal gene transfer between red algae as proposed by Johnson et al.28) Crystal structures of algal VBPOs indicated that enzy-matic activities are achieved by assuming multimeric structures, including a dimer in A. nodosum 9) and a dodecamer in C. officinalis and C. pilulifera.12,13) The Cys residues that participate in inter-or intra-subunit disulfide bonds in the brown alga A. nodosum VBPO 9) are not found in the LnVBPOs. LnVBPOs carrying a 6 \u00d7 His tag at either the N-or C-terminus significantly reduced the bromination activity in the MCD assay. According to the structural information from other red algal VBPOs from Corallina spp., the addition of a 6 \u00d7 His tag at the N-terminus may disrupt the correct assem-bly of subunits and consequently impair the enzyme activity.21) The C-terminus domain adjoins \u03b1-helices involved in the formation of a deep cleft near the V cen-ter [\u03b119 in C. officinalis VBPO 12)]. This implies that the termini regions of the VBPOs have important roles for enzyme activity. The structure/function of LnVBPOs will be investigated by further experiments. The MCD assay was used to examine the bromina-tion activities of the LnVBPOs. The Km values for Br -at pH 6.0 were lower than those reported for native and recombinant VBPOs from other red algae. For instance, in C. plilulifera, 0.092 mM for H2O2 and 11 mM for Br-assaying native VBPO at pH 6.0,29) 0.1 mM for H2O2 and 8.4 mM for Br -assaying recombi-nant VBPO at pH 6.5.30) In C. officinalis, 0.06 mM for H2O2 and 1.0 mM for Br -assaying native VBPO at pH 6.4,31) 0.017 mM for H2O2 and 1.2 mM for Br -assaying recombinant VBPO at pH 6.5.11) Most algal VBPOs, native or recombinant proteins, exhibit an opti-mum pH of approximately 6.0, which is slightly more acidic than the optimum pH of the LnVBPOs (pH 7.0, Table 2). For the VBPO from the red alga G. changii, the optimum pH is 7.0, and the difference in optimum pH may depend on the pH in the habitat.27) The ther-mal stability of recombinant VBPO from C. pilulifera is considerable, and the enzyme activity is maintained even above 80 \u00b0C.25) LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 were less stable and inactivated after treatment at 65 and 75 \u00b0C when comparing the activity at 25 \u00b0C (Table 2). The LnVBPOs did not show chlorination activities under conditions where chlorination activities were detected in other algal VBPOs (1.5 M KCl at pH 6.0 or 4.5).24-26) In the fungus Curvularia inaequalis, the replacement of Ser402 with Ala of vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase (VCPO) results in loss of chlorination activity, but retained bromination activity.32) The con-served Ser residue in algal VBPOs and VCPOs is substi-tuted to Ala530 and Ala538 in LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2, respectively (Fig. 1). The Ser residue inter-acts with the V center, likely throughout the catalytic cycle, and is not directly affected by the binding of H2O2. 33) This Ser has also been proposed to stabilize the protonation state of the peroxo-vanadate intermediate.33) A Ser-to-Ala substitution has been reported for vana-dium-dependent iodoperoxidase (VIPO) from Laminaria digitata,34) VBPOs from Synechococcus spp. CC9311 and WH8020,28) and VBPO from G. changii.27) In VIPO from L. digitata, substitution of Ser to Ala may result in the loss of hydrogen bonding and instead recruitment of Lys to the V center to neutralize the nega-tive charge of the vanadate cofactor.34) Based on the Ser to Ala mutation, it is presumed that the V center of the LnVBPOs is more labile than in VBPOs from A. nodo-sum and Corallina spp. (Fig. 7). In A. nodosum and C. pilulifera, the V center of the VBPOs retains the Ser res-idue and may thus produce a more active catalytic inter-mediate than in the LnVBPOs, resulting in chlorination activity under some conditions.24-26) Moreover, A. nodosum VBPO has a Trp residue, which is essential for Fig. 7. Comparing the V centers of the VBPOs from A. nodosum and the LnVBPOs. Notes: Structure models of LnVBPOs were predicted by SWISS MODEL18-20) and the V centers were visualized in PyMOL. As a comparator, VBPO from A. nodosum was chosen (PDB accession No. 1QI9), since this enzyme was characterized by crystallography.9) The amino acid residues essential for the V center are well conserved in the two species, with the exception of the Ser (Ser416 in A. nosodum) to Ala (Ala530 in LnVBPO1 and Ala538 in LnVBPO2) replacement shown in red. Since the residues constructing the V center in LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 are predicted to be the same, only the model of LnVBPO1 is shown in the figure. 1318 K. Kaneko et al.

The difficulty in separating VBPOs and phycoerythrin has been reported from another red alga C. officinalis.31) When TMS-capped (3E, 6R, 7R)-laurediol (4) was used in the enzymatic bromination reaction, the same MS/MS fragments as those of the desired product, de-acetyllaurencin (3), were detected (Fig. 6). Three bro-mination mechanisms that lead to 3 have been proposed: direct ring formation,5,6) ring-expanding bromoetherification,36) and intramolecular bromonium ion-associated epoxide ring-opening.37) Since our bro-mination experiment was conducted in small scale, fur-ther refinement of experimental conditions could lead to structural and kinetic analysis for reaction products to understand the detailed mechanisms of enzymatic bromination reaction of Laurencia metabolites. In summary, we identified cDNAs encoding VBPOs from L. nipponica which produces unique brominated compounds in the marine environment.3) The Gln-rich insertion is a major feature of the LnVBPOs when compared to other algal VBPOs. The bromination of a derivative of the putative precursor of laurencin was verified after the incubation with recombinant LnVBPOs. The in vitro enzymatic study contributes to our knowledge about the biosynthesis of unique bromi-nated metabolites from Laurencia and builds on previ-ous in vivo algal culture experiments.38) Supplemental material The supplemental material for this paper is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2014.918482.

        "The marine red alga genus Laurencia is one of the richest producers of unique brominated com-pounds in the marine environment. The cDNAs for two Laurencia nipponica vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases (LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme assays of recombinant LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 using monochlorodimedone revealed that they were thermolabile but their Km values for Br -were sig-nificantly lower than other red algal VBPOs. The bromination reaction was also assessed using laure-diol, the predicted natural precursor of the bromi-nated ether laurencin. Laurediol, protected by trimethylsilyl at the enyne, was converted to deace-tyllaurencin by the LnVBPOs, which was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. Native LnVBPO par-tially purified from algal bodies was active, suggest-ing that LnVBPO is functional in vivo. These results contributed to our knowledge of the biosynthesis of Laurencia brominated metabolites. Key words: vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase;",

        "Since the pioneering work on the isolation of the brominated compound laurencin (1) from the red alga Laurencia nipponica,1,2) many halogenated compounds, mostly brominated compounds, have been reported from algae. To date, more than 600 metabolites have been identified from Laurencia spp. with several diverse and unique carbon skeletons, including C15 ace-togenins, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and triterpe-noids.3) It is known that some of these compounds show cytotoxicity and antibacterial activitiy.3) Hence, Laurencia metabolites are potentially useful for phar-maceutical applications. Despite the increasing number of reports of halogenated compounds isolated from Laurencia spp., studies on the biosynthesis of these halogenated compounds are limited.",
        "The leading work focused on the bromination step of the C15 acetogenins of Laurencia spp., in particular 1. These early studies achieved the enzymatic bromination of the deduced precursor of 1, laurediol (2),4) using commercially available lactoperoxidase (LPO) or par-tially purified bromoperoxidase (BPO) from L. nippo-nica.5,6) These first studies also achieved the enzymatic synthesis of a final precursor of 1, deacetyllaurencin (3) (Scheme 1). Although the yields of this synthesis were low (1 mg from 73.8 mg using LPO, 0.02 mg from 101 mg using BPO), the studies suggested that LPO-or BPO-like activities could catalyze the bromin-ation of Laurencia metabolites. BPO from L. nipponica has been only partially puri-fied,6) and its structural and biochemical information have remained largely unknown. On the other hand, BPOs have been isolated from other algae, and most of these BPOs have been identified as vanadium-depen-dent bromoperoxidases (VBPOs) that require vanadate (VO3None4 ) as cofactor. 7-14) Therefore, we cloned and expressed VBPOs from L. nipponica to clarify the bromination step of second-ary metabolites in Laurencia spp. Evaluation of the activities of the VBPOs was conducted using a surrogate compound and a physiologically relevant precursor.",

        "cDNA cloning of LnVBPOs. Double stranded cDNA (dscDNA) was synthesized from Poly (A)+ RNA with the SuperscriptTM Plasmid System with Gateway Technology for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For rapid amplifica-tion of cDNA ends (RACE PCR), adaptor sequences were attached to dscDNA with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Takara). The primer pair for 5\u2032-RACE was AP1 (Marathon kit) and Rv1 (5\u2032-GCCGGCATCA-AAGAACGCCTTGAG-3\u2032). For 3\u2032-RACE, the primer pair was AP1 and Fw1 (5\u2032-CAGTAGTGGACAGTG-ACTTGC-3\u2032). Fw1 and Rv1 were designed by referring to the VBPO cDNA sequences of the red alga Porphyra yezoensis (the accession number AU187606, AU189808, and AU196993),16) which were retrieved from the open EST database of Kazusa DNA Research Institution (Chiba, Japan). Takara Ex Taq. (Takara) was utilized for RACE PCR under the following conditions: 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, 28 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 54 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a final elonga-tion at 72 \u00b0C for 3 min. After verifying the presence of the PCR products by 1.0% TBE agarose gel electro-phoresis, PCR products were excised with the QIA-quick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Plasmids were transformed into DH5\u03b1 E. coli cells and purified with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) for nucleotide sequencing. Finally, two cDNA sequences encoding VBPO-like proteins, LnVBPO1 (AB830711) and LnVBPO2 (AB847108), were obtained. The cDNA sequences were subjected to alignment and phylogenic analysis using BioEdit 17) and FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software). Mono-mer structure models of LnVBPOs were predicted by SWISS-MODEL.18-20) Predicted models were visual-ized with PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/).",

DNA inserts were prepared by PCR using primer sets with a NdeI site on the start codon and a BamHI site after the stop codon, respectively (LnVBPO1_Ex_Fw: 5\u2032-CAT-ACACATATGGACCACTACACTCACGTT-3\u2032 and LnVB-PO1_Ex_Rv: 5\u2032-TTAACATTGGGATCCATATCTAATT-CGAAT-3\u2032, LnVBPO2_Ex_Fw: 5\u2032-CCCACCCATATGG-AACACTACACTCACATC-3\u2032 and LnVBPO2_Ex_Rv: 5\u2032-AGCCTACATGGATCCCTACAAGTCACGGC-3\u2032). KOD polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was utilized for PCR amplification under the following conditions: 94 \u00b0C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 56 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 2min. The PCR products were excised from a 1.0% TBE agarose gel and digested with NdeI and BamHI. The digested products were then introduced into the corresponding sites of pET21a or pET15b vectors (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). pET21a was used for expression of the untagged LnVBPOs (LnVBPOs) and the C-terminal 6 \u00d7His tagged (LnVBPOs-C) proteins. pET15b was used for the N-terminal 6 \u00d7His tagged (LnVBPOs-N) proteins. Expression plasmids of LnVBPOs-C were constructed from the plasmids of untagged LnVBPOs by conversion the 3\u2032-terminal regions as follows. First, PCR amplification of the 3\u2032-terminal region was conducted using a primer set designed to amplify upstream of the",
        "SalI site of LnVBPO1 (LnVBPO1_Fw2: 5\u2032-AACACA-CAGATGGACCGTGATA-3\u2032) or the ClaI site of LnVBPO2 (LnVBPO2_Fw2: 5\u2032-CACCGTCGCCGGG-GCGTGCACAA-3\u2032), and the 3\u2032-terminal region of LnVBPOs. The 3\u2032-terminal primers were designed to replace the stop codon with XhoI (LnVBPO1_3t: 5\u2032-ACGCTCGAGCACCGTCACGCAACTGC-3\u2032 and Ln-VBPO2_3t: 5\u2032-AAACTCGAGCGCACGTGCCATCAA-AC-3\u2032) and amplified using Takara Ex Taq polymerase as described above. The PCR products were digested with SalI and XhoI or ClaI and XhoI and were then used to replace the corresponding regions of the original LnVBPO constructs. All expression plasmids were electroporated into the E. coli expression strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Takara).",
        "Purification of recombinant LnVBPO proteins. Heterologous expression of LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 was conducted similarly to the experiments conducted with Corallina pilulifera and C. officinalis.10,11,21) Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS were inoculated in 1 L of Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium (1%) containing 50 \u03bcg/mL of carbenicillin disodium salt and incubated until mid log phase at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (120 rpm).

The eluted fractions were monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm and checked by 10% SDS-PAGE under reduc-ing conditions (2-mercaptoethanol, 2ME+) according to Laemmli.22) LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 were eluted with 0.4 and 0.8M KBr, respectively. Peak fractions of LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 were concentrated after dial-ysis against the basic buffer.

For the VBPO from the red alga G. changii, the optimum pH is 7.0, and the difference in optimum pH may depend on the pH in the habitat.27) The ther-mal stability of recombinant VBPO from C. pilulifera is considerable, and the enzyme activity is maintained even above 80 \u00b0C.25) LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 were less stable and inactivated after treatment at 65 and 75 \u00b0C when comparing the activity at 25 \u00b0C (Table 2).

The Ser residue inter-acts with the V center, likely throughout the catalytic cycle, and is not directly affected by the binding of H2O2. 33) This Ser has also been proposed to stabilize the protonation state of the peroxo-vanadate intermediate.33) A Ser-to-Ala substitution has been reported for vana-dium-dependent iodoperoxidase (VIPO) from Laminaria digitata,34) VBPOs from Synechococcus spp. CC9311 and WH8020,28) and VBPO from G. changii.27) In VIPO from L. digitata, substitution of Ser to Ala may result in the loss of hydrogen bonding and instead recruitment of Lys to the V center to neutralize the nega-tive charge of the vanadate cofactor.34) Based on the Ser to Ala mutation, it is presumed that the V center of the LnVBPOs is more labile than in VBPOs from A. nodo-sum and Corallina spp. (Fig. 7). In A. nodosum and C. pilulifera, the V center of the VBPOs retains the Ser res-idue and may thus produce a more active catalytic inter-mediate than in the LnVBPOs, resulting in chlorination activity under some conditions.24-26) Moreover, A. nodosum VBPO has a Trp residue, which is essential for",

Since the residues constructing the V center in LnVBPO1 and LnVBPO2 are predicted to be the same, only the model of LnVBPO1 is shown in the figure. 1318 K. Kaneko et al.",

        "The same peptide fragments between LnVBPOs and partially purified BPO from algal bodies were verified by nanoLC\u2013MS/MS (Fig. 1 and Table 1), suggesting that LnVBPOs are the functional proteins in vivo. The difficulty in separating VBPOs and phycoerythrin has been reported from another red alga C. officinalis.31)",
        "When TMS-capped (3E, 6R, 7R)-laurediol (4) was used in the enzymatic bromination reaction, the same MS/MS fragments as those of the desired product, de-acetyllaurencin (3), were detected (Fig. 6). Three bro-mination mechanisms that lead to 3 have been proposed: direct ring formation,5,6) ring-expanding bromoetherification,36) and intramolecular bromonium ion-associated epoxide ring-opening.37) Since our bro-mination experiment was conducted in small scale, fur-ther refinement of experimental conditions could lead to structural and kinetic analysis for reaction products to understand the detailed mechanisms of enzymatic bromination reaction of Laurencia metabolites.",
        "In summary, we identified cDNAs encoding VBPOs from L. nipponica which produces unique brominated compounds in the marine environment.3) The Gln-rich insertion is a major feature of the LnVBPOs when compared to other algal VBPOs. The bromination of a derivative of the putative precursor of laurencin was verified after the incubation with recombinant LnVBPOs. The in vitro enzymatic study contributes to our knowledge about the biosynthesis of unique bromi-nated metabolites from Laurencia and builds on previ-ous in vivo algal culture experiments.38) Supplemental material",
