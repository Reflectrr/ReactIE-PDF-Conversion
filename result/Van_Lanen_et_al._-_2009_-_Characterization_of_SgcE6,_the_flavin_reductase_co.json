Abstract The C-1027 enediyne antitumor antibiotic from Streptomyces globisporus possesses an (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-b-tyrosine moiety, the chloro-and hydroxy-substitu-ents of which are installed by a flavin-dependent halogenase SgcC3 and mono-oxygenase SgcC, respectively. Interestingly, a single flavin reductase, SgcE6, can provide reduced flavin to both enzymes. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that, similar to other flavin reductases involved in natural product biosynthesis, SgcE6 belongs to the HpaC-like subfamily of the Class I flavin reductases. The present study describes the steady-state kinetic characterization of SgcE6 as a strictly NADH-and FAD-specific enzyme. Introduction The enediynes are a potent family of antitumor antibiotics possessing an enediyne core to which several peripheral moieties are attached. The enediyne core can undergo Berg-man or Myers\u2013Saito cyclization to generate a benzenoid diradical capable of abstracting protons from DNA, causing double-strand breaks and cross-linking that ultimately lead to cell death (Galm et al., 2005; Van Lanen & Shen, 2008). Although the enediyne core is the bioactive warhead of the molecule, the peripheral moieties also play important func-tional roles. For example, the (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-b-tyrosine moiety of C-1027 enediyne antitumor antibiotic modulates the reactivity of the enediyne core, and C-1027 analogs lacking the chloro-or hydroxy-substituents of this moiety exhibit modified bioactivity (Kennedy et al., 2007a, b). Biosynthesis of the b-tyrosine moiety of C-1027 in Streptomyces globisporus proceeds from tyrosine via an aminomutase reaction, adenylation, and then chlorination and hydroxylation before being appended to the enediyne core by a condensation enzyme (Fig. 1) (Lin et al., 2009). The chlorination and hydroxylation reactions have been characterized, and each is catalyzed by a two-component system comprised of either a flavin-dependent halogenase (SgcC3) (Lin et al., 2007) or a monooxygenase (SgcC) (Lin et al., 2008) component that obtains reduced flavin (FADH2) from a separate flavin reductase component FEMS Microbiol Lett 300 (2009) 237\u2013241 cNone 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Moreover, the Escherichia coli flavin reductase (Fre) could also be substituted for SgcE6 without impacting the activities of SgcC3 or SgcC, implying that SgcC/C3 obtain FADH2 by diffusion rather than delivery by SgcE6 via specific protein\u2013protein interactions. Diffusion of reduced flavin has been proposed in the HpaB\u2013HpaC two-component system to be coordinated by a high intracellular concentration and flavin-binding affinity of the oxygenase component (Louie et al., 2003), while evidence for protein\u2013protein interaction has been obtained in the PrnF\u2013PrnD system (Lee & Zhao, 2007). The production of diffusible FADH2 as opposed to the requirement of specific protein\u2013protein interactions during C-1027 biosynthesis is consistent with the observation that SgcE6 is the only flavin reductase in the gene cluster and therefore must serve all flavin-dependent enzymes for the C-1027 pathway in S. globisporus. Flavin reductases use NAD(P)H to generate reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), or riboflavin. Although flavin reduction is often coupled with substrate oxidation in a single active site, there are many examples of two-component systems that use a discrete flavin reductase enzyme (van Berkel et al., 2006). Flavin reductases have been classified based on whether flavin is used as a substrate or is tightly bound to the enzyme as a prosthetic group (Galan et al., 2000). The former group, Class I flavin reductases, is further divided into at least three families, each exemplified by (1) E. coli Fre, (2) FRaseI from Vibrio fischeri, and (3) E. coli HpaC (Galan et al., 2000). The HpaC-like subfamily was discovered only recently and possesses two consensus motifs: (1) a Ser, Thr, or Cys before a pair of Pro residues near the N-terminus and (2) a GDH motif located near the C-terminus (Galan et al., 2000). Interestingly, several flavin reductases proposed to be in-volved in antibiotic biosynthesis belong to the HpaC-like subfamily, and a crystal structure has been described (van den Heuvel et al., 2004). Our previous work demonstrated that SgcE6 functions to supply diffusible FADH2 to SgcC3 and SgcC (Lin et al., 2007, 2008), but the ability of SgcE6 to use FMN or NADPH was not investigated. Herein, we (1) investigate the substrate preference and steady-state kinetics of SgcE6 and (2) use bioinformatics analysis to assign SgcE6 to the HpaC-like subfamily of Class I flavin reductases. Materials and methods Chemicals FAD disodium salt, FMN sodium salt, b-NADH disodium salt, and NADPH were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Proteins SgcE6 was overproduced in E. coli and purified as described previously (Lin et al., 2007). SgcE6 activity assays All assays were performed in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5.

The oxidation of NAD(P)H was detected by monitoring A340 nm vs. time (e340 6220 M None1 cmNone1) (Fontecave et al., 1987). Steady-state kinetic assays were performed under the same conditions, but using 176 nM SgcE6 and using variable concentrations of either FAD or NADH. The steady-state kinetic parameters were obtained by nonlinear regression to fit the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation to a plot of the initial velocity vs. substrate concentration data using the KALEIDAGRAPH software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Bioinformatics analysis Amino acid sequences of HpaC-like enzymes and SgcE6 were retrieved from the NCBI server and subjected to multiple sequence alignment using the CLUSTAL X software version 1.83. The percent sequence identity and similarity of selected flavin reductases with SgcE6 were determined by pairwise BLAST alignment on the NCBI server. Results and discussion Bioinformatics analysis Amino acid sequence alignment with several other flavin reductases revealed that SgcE6 shares low-sequence homol-ogy with Fre from E. coli (11% identity and 23% similarity) or FRaseI from V. fischeri (11% identity and 22% similarity), but significant sequence identity (4 25%) with members of the HpaC-like family (Fig. 2). Moreover, SgcE6 possesses the S/T/CxxPP and GDH consensus motifs characteristic of the HpaC-like subfamily of the Class I flavin reductases. There-fore, SgcE6 was annotated as a member of the HpaC-like Fig. 2. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of several Class I flavin reductases.

Substrate preference of SgcE6 The rate of consumption of NADH in the presence of FAD was shown to be dependent on the SgcE6 concentration, consistent with enzymatic catalysis (Fig. 3). The substrate preference of SgcE6 was then probed by comparing the relative activities toward each possible combination of reductant (NADH or NADPH) and oxidized flavin (FAD or FMN). As shown in Fig. 4, NADH and FAD was the only combination that produced a detectable time-dependent decrease in A340 nm, indicating that SgcE6 is specific for these substrates. Although high selectivity for NADH vs. NADPH is common among Class I flavin reductases, such strict flavin specificity is not (Galan et al., 2000). Indeed, the specificity constants for FAD vs. FMN consumption typically vary within one order of magnitude [HpaC, threefold (Galan et al., 2000); RebF, twofold (Yeh et al., 2005); PrnF, 13-fold (Lee & Zhao, 2007); VlmR, threefold (Parry & Li, 1997); ActVB, fivefold (Kendrew et al., 1995); TcpX, threefold (Belchik & Xun, 2008); TftC, twofold (Gisi & Xun, 2003); and NmoB, twofold (Deng et al., 2007)]. Although the assay was only performed using a single enzyme concentration, our inability to detect activity for FMN suggests that SgcE6 is much more than 10-fold less active towards this substrate relative to FAD (Fig. 4). This apparently strict flavin preference of SgcE6 may represent a unique opportunity to study flavin selectivity determinants in Class I enzymes. Steady-state kinetics The steady-state kinetic parameters for NADH oxidation by SgcE6 were determined using both NADH and FAD in varying concentrations, yielding Km = 53None 8 mM for NADH and Km = 8.2None 0.9mM for FAD. A higher Km for NADH vs. FAD is typical for related flavin reductases. As expected, the kcat values were nearly identical, with kcat = 3.1None 0.1 sNone1 for NADH and kcat = 4.5None 0.6 sNone1 for FAD (Fig. 5). Therefore, Fig. 3.

D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /fem sle/article/300/2/237/453329 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June the production of FADH2 by SgcE6 is about two orders of magnitude faster than its consumption by its monooxygen-ase partner SgcC (Lin et al., 2008), and the difference appears to be even greater with respect to the halogenase SgcC3 (Lin et al., 2007). This finding suggests that SgcE6 can adequately supply reduced flavin under saturating substrate conditions to support SgcC3 and SgcC catalysis during C-1027 biosynthesis. In summary, bioinformatics and biochemical studies have provided a new insight into SgcE6, the flavin reductase from the C-1027 biosynthetic pathway in S. globisporus. Sequence alignment has revealed that SgcE6 is a member of the HpaC-like subfamily of Class I flavin reductases. Mem-bers of this recently described subfamily are involved in a variety of biological processes including oxidation of aro-matic compounds (Galan et al., 2000; van den Heuvel et al., 2004) and antibiotic biosynthesis (Kendrew et al., 1995; Parry & Li, 1997; Yeh et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2007, 2008). Biochemical studies demonstrated that SgcE6 accepts only NADH and FAD as substrates, and the apparently strict FAD requirement is unusual for a Class I flavin reductase. Finally, the steady-state kinetic parameters for FAD and NADH substrates were determined, showing relative Km values typical of flavin reductase enzymes. Acknowledgements We thank Dr Y.

        "Substrate preference of SgcE6 The rate of consumption of NADH in the presence of FAD was shown to be dependent on the SgcE6 concentration, consistent with enzymatic catalysis (Fig. 3). The substrate preference of SgcE6 was then probed by comparing the relative activities toward each possible combination of reductant (NADH or NADPH) and oxidized flavin (FAD or FMN). As shown in Fig. 4, NADH and FAD was the only combination that produced a detectable time-dependent decrease in A340 nm, indicating that SgcE6 is specific for these substrates. Although high selectivity for NADH vs. NADPH is common among Class I flavin reductases, such strict flavin specificity is not (Galan et al., 2000). Indeed, the specificity constants for FAD vs. FMN consumption typically vary within one order of magnitude [HpaC, threefold (Galan et al., 2000); RebF, twofold (Yeh et al., 2005); PrnF, 13-fold (Lee & Zhao, 2007); VlmR, threefold (Parry & Li, 1997); ActVB, fivefold (Kendrew et al., 1995); TcpX, threefold (Belchik & Xun, 2008); TftC, twofold (Gisi & Xun, 2003); and NmoB, twofold (Deng et al., 2007)]. Although the assay was only performed using a single enzyme concentration, our inability to detect activity for FMN suggests that SgcE6 is much more than 10-fold less active towards this substrate relative to FAD (Fig. 4). This apparently strict flavin preference of SgcE6 may represent a unique opportunity to study flavin selectivity determinants in Class I enzymes.",

        "the production of FADH2 by SgcE6 is about two orders of magnitude faster than its consumption by its monooxygen-ase partner SgcC (Lin et al., 2008), and the difference appears to be even greater with respect to the halogenase SgcC3 (Lin et al., 2007). This finding suggests that SgcE6 can adequately supply reduced flavin under saturating substrate conditions to support SgcC3 and SgcC catalysis during C-1027 biosynthesis.",
        "In summary, bioinformatics and biochemical studies have provided a new insight into SgcE6, the flavin reductase from the C-1027 biosynthetic pathway in S. globisporus. Sequence alignment has revealed that SgcE6 is a member of the HpaC-like subfamily of Class I flavin reductases. Mem-bers of this recently described subfamily are involved in a variety of biological processes including oxidation of aro-matic compounds (Galan et al., 2000; van den Heuvel et al., 2004) and antibiotic biosynthesis (Kendrew et al., 1995; Parry & Li, 1997; Yeh et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2007, 2008). Biochemical studies demonstrated that SgcE6 accepts only NADH and FAD as substrates, and the apparently strict FAD requirement is unusual for a Class I flavin reductase. Finally, the steady-state kinetic parameters for FAD and NADH substrates were determined, showing relative Km values typical of flavin reductase enzymes.",
