George *a Covering: Up to January 2020 Meroterpenoids derived from the polyketide 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) are complex natural products produced exclusively by Streptomyces bacteria. These antibacterial compounds include the napyradiomycins, merochlorins, marinones, and furaquinocins and have inspired many attempts at their chemical synthesis. In this review, we highlight the role played by biosynthetic studies in the stimulation of biomimetic and, ultimately, chemoenzymatic total syntheses of these natural products. In particular, the application of genome mining techniques to marine Streptomyces bacteria led to the discovery of unique prenyltransferase and vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase enzymes that can be used as highly selective biocatalysts in fully enzymatic total syntheses, thus overcoming the limitations of purely chemical reagents. 1.

Introduction Meroterpenoids are natural products of mixed biosynthetic origin that are formed in part from a terpenoid co-substrate.1 These hybrid molecules are broadly produced in nature by bacteria, fungi, plants, algae and animals and combine terpenoid building blocks with polyketides, phenols, alkaloids, and amino acids to achieve amazing chemical diversity.2\u20135 Some notable examples include the cofactor ubiquinone andmedicines such as vincristine, mycophenolic acid and tetrahydrocannabinol. During the past four decades, several families of naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoids have been discovered from marine and soil-derived streptomycete bacteria.6 These natural products have been linked, through both biosynthetic speculation and 13C-labelling studies, to 1,3,6,8-tetrahydrox-ynaphthalene (THN, 1) as the key aromatic polyketide building block (Scheme 1). In bacteria, THN is biosynthesised by the condensation and aromatisation of \ue103ve malonyl coenzyme A subunits under the control of a THN synthase.7 Bacterial THN synthases possess a simple, type III polyketide synthase homodimeric structure.8 Several THN synthases have been implicated in the biosynthesis of bacterial meroterpenoids, This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Review Natural Product Reports Pu bl is he d on  30 Ju ne  202 0.

THN undergoes spontaneous aerobic oxidation to give \ue104aviolin (2), which shares a super\ue103cial similarity in structure to several bacterial meroterpenoids such as the furaquinocins (e.g. fur-aquinocin A,12 3) and the napyradiomycins (e.g. napyradiomycin B1,13 4). Indeed, biosynthetic studies have shown that \ue104aviolin is a likely biosynthetic precursor of the furaquinocins.11,14 However, it has recently been shown that most marine mer-oterpenoids \u2013 such as the merochlorins (e.g.merochlorin A,9 5), marinones (e.g. marinone,15 6) and napyradiomycins \u2013 are rather derived directly from THN itself, with oxidation, halo-genation and cyclisation steps occurring a\ue09der the initial pre-nylation of THN. Various prenyl donors, including prenyl, geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate, are initially appended to Lauren Murray is a PhD candi-date in synthetic organic chem-istry at The University of Adelaide, Australia.

This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 the nucleophilic C-2 and C-4 positions of THN via electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions catalysed by aromatic prenyl-transferase enzymes.16 Subsequently, vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) enzymes catalyse a range of reactions including direct halogenation, oxidative dearomatisation, hal-ocyclisation, and a-hydroxyketone rearrangements, to give complex meroterpenoid molecular architectures such as 4, 5 and 6.17 This review has several aims. Firstly, we have distilled over thirty years of isolation work to present all of the known THN-derived meroterpenoids in a logical manner. The modular nature of the biosynthesis of these meroterpenoids presents many opportunities for diversi\ue103cation within each sub-family, so we hope that this section will help the reader to make connections between these unusual natural products.

View Article Onlinewe present the early 13C-biosynthetic labelling studies of THN meroterpenoids, which gave valuable information on the origin of the polyketide and terpene building blocks, but not enough to fully elucidate the biosynthetic pathways. As a consequence, the pioneering total syntheses of napyradiomycins by Nakata,18 Tatsuta19 and Snyder20 were uninformed by \ue103rm knowledge of their biosynthesis. Thirdly, and in a roughly linear narrative, we describe how the advent of genome analysis has transformed studies on the biosynthesis and total synthesis of complex meroterpenoids. Three case studies on the merochlorins, the napyradiomycins and the marinones are presented in which the discovery of unique prenyltransferase and vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase (VCPO) enzymes from the respective gene clusters allowed the biosynthetic jigsaw puzzles to be solved piece by piece. This biosynthetic work directly inspired biomi-metic total syntheses of THN-derived meroterpenoids by several research groups, in addition to a fully enzymatic total synthesis of napyradiomycins A1 and B1. The use of a unique combina-tion of polyketide synthase, prenyltransferase and VCPO enzymes in one-pot synthetic operations represents the ideal end point in the total synthesis of THN meroterpenoids, although challenges remain in terms of scalability and product diversi\ue103cation in the synthesis of the napyradiomycins. Finally, biosynthetic and synthetic work on the furaquinocins and azamerone are summarised. In both cases, the \ue103nal key steps of the biosynthetic pathways are unknown, which presents future opportunities for the discovery of new enzymes and biomimetic chemical reactions. 2. Isolation and biological activity 2.1 Napyradiomycins The napyradiomycins are by far the largest family of THN meroterpenoids, with over \ue103\ue09dy natural products reported to date. The simplest member of the family is naphthomevalin (7), which features a naphthoquinone core adorned with prenyl and chlorine substituents at C-2, and geranyl and hydroxyl groups at C-3. All members of the napyradiomycin family can be 1336 | Nat. Prod. Rep., 2020, 37, 1334\u20131366 considered to be functionalised derivatives of naphthomevalin (7) (Fig. 1). For example, halocyclisation of the C-2 prenyl substituent gives a large group of tricyclic napyradiomycins with a 6,6,6 ring system, while the C-3 geranyl group can also undergo halocyclisation to form an additional cyclohexane ring. The C-7 position of the le\ue09d hand aromatic ring can be methyl-ated or not, while the C-5 position can undergo amination and diazotisation to form a series of unusual diazoketone natural products. Intramolecular substitution of the C-2 chlorine substituent with the C-3 tertiary alcohol can form epoxide natural products, or it can be eliminated to introduce further unsaturation. Finally, allylic oxidation of the C-3 geranyl group can occur at various positions, with oxidative macrocyclisation on this substituent also possible. Many combinations of these functionalisations can occur in biosynthesis, which leads to the great diversity of napyradiomycins found in nature. The simplest, bicyclic napyradiomycin meroterpenoids are shown in Fig. 2. Naphthomevalin (7) itself was isolated from a culture broth of a Streptomyces sp. strain Go\u0308 28, originally found in a soil sample collected at Strathgordon, Australia. This metabolite possesses weak antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.21 Treatment of 7 with sodium hydroxide formed the epoxide natural product A80915G (8), which had previously been isolated from Streptomyces aculeolatus A80915, a bacterial strain found in a soil sample collected from Palau, This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Fig. 2 Napyradiomycin natural products with uncyclised C-2 prenyl and C-3 geranyl substituents.

The marine-derived metabolite A80915G-800-acid (9) produced by Streptomyces sp. MS239 is an oxidised version of 8, and it showed only weak antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 (64 mgmLNone1).23 SF2415B1 (10), B2 (11), A1 (12) and A2 (13) feature methyl substituents at C-7, plus various combinations of C2\u2013C3 epoxide and C-5 diazoketone functional groups. They were isolated from the culture \ue103ltrate of S. acu-leolatus SF2415.24,25 The producing organism was found in a soil sample collected in Tottori Prefecture, Japan, and these natural products were found to have moderate activities against Gram-positive bacteria. Fig. 3 Napyradiomycin natural products with cyclised C-2 prenyl substi This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Napyradiomycin A1 (14) is perhaps the most well-known member of the napyradiomycin family (Fig. 3). Amongst the \ue103rst of the napyradiomycins to be reported, it was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces rubra (formerly Chainia rubra)26 MG802-AF1, which was found in a soil sample collected in Niigata Prefecture, Japan.13 The 6,6,6 ring system of 14 could be formed by chlorocyclisation of the C-2 prenyl side chain of naphthomevalin. Napyradiomycin A1 (14) was found to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria including multiple drug-resistant strains such as Staphylococcus aureus MS8710 and MS9610.27 Many variants of the napyradiomycin A1 structure have been isolated. For example, 3-dechloro-3-bromo-napyradiomycin-A1 (15) and 4-dehydro-4a-dechloro-napyradiomycin A1 (16) were isolated from the culture broth of a marine-derived actinomycete strain SCSIO 10428.28 In tuents.

View Article Onlinegeneral, it appears that bromination-cyclisation is less common than chlorination-cyclisation in napyradiomycin biosynthesis, so brominated natural products such as 15 are rare. Napyr-adiomycin analogues 15 and 16 displayed antibacterial activi-ties against three Staphylococcus and Bacillus strains with MIC values ranging from 0.5 to 8 mg mLNone1, and possessed moderate cytotoxicities against four human cancer cell lines SF-268, MCF-7, NCI-H460, and HepG-2 with IC50 values ranging from 11.5 to 22.8 mM. Napyradiomycin A2, with an oxidised geranyl side chain, was originally isolated from the culture broth of S. rubra MG802-AF1.29 The absolute con\ue103guration of the C-21 hydroxyl group was not determined upon initial isolation. However, two stereoisomers were later re-isolated from Streptomyces anti-mycoticus NT17, which were named napyradiomycin A2a (17) and napyradiomycin A2b (18) and were found to have absolute con\ue103gurations at C-21 of 16R and 16S, respectively. Both 17 and 18 showed antibacterial activities against clinical bacterial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) MB5393, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. They also possess moderate cytotoxic activities with IC50 values of 30.4 mM and 28.6 mM against the human liver adenocarcinoma cell line HepG-2.30 Napyradiomycin A3 (19) possesses an enone functional group formed by elimination of the C-2 chlorine substituent. It was isolated from the marine-derived Strepto-myces sp. strain CA-271078,31 and was not found to have anti-bacterial and antifungal properties on the cell lines tested. 18-Hydroxynapyradiomycin A1 (20), 18-oxonapyradiomycin A1 (21), 16-oxonapyradiomycin A2 (22) and 7-demethyl SF2415A3 (23) were all isolated from the culture broth of S. antimycoticus NT17.30 Diazo compound 23 displayed antibacterial activity against S. aureus 209P JC-1 (MIC 2.0 nM mLNone1), B. subtilis ATCC6633 (1.0 nM mLNone1), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433 (31.6 nM mLNone1), Enterococcus faecium ATCC19434 (15.8 nM mLNone1), and Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC12344 (7.8 nM mLNone1). The antibiotics SF2415A3 (24) and SF2415B3 (25) were isolated from the culture \ue103ltrate of S. acu-leolatus.24,25 Both 24 and 25 were found to have moderate activities towards Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Bacillus strains of Gram-positive bacteria, with 24 being more potent. The antibacterial activities of 23 and 24 were found to be almost identical, suggesting that the C-7 methyl group does not affect the biological activity in this series. CNQ525.538 (26) was iso-lated from Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 (ref. 32) and found to have moderate cytotoxicity against HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells (IC50 6 mM). The largest sub-family of the napyradiomycins are tetracyclic compounds such as napyradiomycins B1 (4), B2 (27) and B3 (28), which were isolated from the culture broth of S. rubra MG802-AF1 (Fig. 4).13,27 In these natural products, both C-2 prenyl and C-3 geranyl side chains have cyclised to form complex structures with up to three halogenated stereocentres. The halocyclisation of the geranyl side chain is clearly highly stereoselective, as all of these natural products possess the same stereochemical con\ue103guration at C-17 and at the newly chlorinated or brominated C-21 position. Napyradiomycin B2 (27) exhibited good antibacterial activity against MRSA (MIC \u00bc 3\u20136 mg mLNone1) and moderate activity 1338 | Nat. Prod.

Two oxidised members of the naphterpin family, naphterpins B (67) and C (68), were later isolated from the same producing organism Streptomyces sp. CL190.40 Naphterpins 67 and 68 also suppressed lipid peroxidation in rat homogenate system with IC50 values of 6.5 mg mL None1 and 6.0 mg mLNone1, respectively. In 2018, naphterpins D (69) and E (70) were isolated from Strep-tomyces sp. CNQ-509, isolated from the marine sediment collected near La Jolla, California.41 Similar to other members of the naphterpin family, both of these compounds were identi\ue103ed as radical scavengers. Lacking the C-7 methyl substituent of naphterpin, 7-demethylnaphterpin (71) was isolated in 1992 from Streptomyces prunicolor.42 Like naphterpin itself, 71 possesses antioxidative activities and is known to inhibit the lipid peroxidase in rat liver microsomes (IC50\u00bc 9 mgmLNone1).

Several oxidised naphterpin and naphthgeranine natural products have also been isolated, presumably arising from cytochrome P450 mediated C\u2013H oxidations of the terpene-derived ring systems. For example, the naphthgeranines A\u2013E (71\u201375) were isolated from Streptomyces violaceus Tu\u0308 3556,43 a bacterial strain that was originally discovered in a soil sample collected in Nepal. Naphthgeranines A (71) and B (72) showed weak antibacterial and antifungal activities, and moderate cytocidal activity against various tumor cell lines in vitro. In 1995 another member of the family, naphthgeranine F (76), was isolated from the same bacteria S. violaceus Tu\u0308 3556.44 This compound was found to have weak antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis ATCC6051, Bacillus brevis ATCC9999, Streptomyces vir-idochromogenes Tu\u0308 57), with similar MIC values to that of naphthgeranine C (73).

Further cyclisation of the farnesyl side chain results in a cyclohexane ring in each member of the family. The marfuraquinocins differ only in their con\ue103guration at C-13 and their oxidation state at C-11, although the relative con\ue103guration at C-16 was also not determined for any of these meroterpenoids (Fig. 13).

Early biosynthetic studies The early biosynthetic studies of the naphthoquinone-based streptomycete meroterpenoids focused on stable isotope label-ling with 13C-labelled acetate to establish their biosynthetic origins. In 1987, Shiomi and colleagues reported preliminary isotope incorporation results with the napyradiomycins only a year a\ue09der they were \ue103rst reported.29 Feeding experiments with [2-13C]acetate and [1,2-13C]acetate established that the napyr-adiomycins are derived from a symmetrical pentaketide, such as 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN, 1), and two isoprenes, namely the \ue103ve-carbon dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and the ten-carbon geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) (Fig. 16). Moreover, the enriched 13C-NMR signals in the napyradiomycin molecules allowed for the authors to reassign multiple carbon assignments in napyradiomycins A1 and C4. Soon therea\ue09der, two reports in 1990 by the laboratories of Seto and Omura similarly showed that naphterpin (66)55 and the furaquinocins,56 respectively, most likely also originate from the coupling of THN and GPP precursors (Fig. 17 and 18). In all three examples, the isotope labelling patterns established that the isoprene units originate from the mevalonate pathway. Debromomarinone (79) and neomarinone (99) offered a slight departure regarding the origin of their isoprene units as reported by Moore in 2003.53 While 13C-acetate symmetrically labelled the naphthoquinone moieties indicative of a THN building block, the sesquiterpene-derived carbons of 79 and 99 showed no enrichment (Fig. 19). Feeding experiments with 13C-labelled glucose alternatively enriched the terpenoid fragments consistent with a non-mevalonate or methyl D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway origin of its farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) precursor. The 13C-enrichment in the isoprene sidechain of 99 moreover had the added bene\ue103t of revealing that the original structure proposed by Fenical46 was incorrect and should be revised as depicted in Fig. 19.53 The \ue103rst connection of clustered biosynthesis genes to chemistry for a naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoid from Fig. 16 Labelling pattern of napyradiomycin B1 (4) from [2-13C] acetate.29 Nat.

The following year, the Moore group discovered and validated the napyradiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster via heterologous expression studies.10 These early meroterpenoid gene cluster studies con\ue103rmed that the common THN frag-ment is derived from a type III polyketide synthase, namely THN synthase, that had only been discovered in bacteria a few years prior by Horinouchi and colleagues.7 THN synthase is a homodimeric enzyme8 responsible for pigmented melanin production in Streptomyces bacteria in addition to being integral in meroterpenoid biosynthesis. The gene clusters also similarly harboured a complete set of genes encoding isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway as well as an ABBA prenyltransferase (or two in the case of napyr-adiomycin) that was \ue103rst established for naphterpin biosyn-thesis by Kuzuyama.58 The napyradiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster also featured genes encoding vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (VHPOs), the \ue103rst of its kind identi\ue103ed (and later biochemically validated) from a bacterium. These rare prokaryotic halogenating enzymes would later be shown to be synonymous with chlorinated meroterpenoids and become instrumental biocatalysts for the enzymatic construction of these natural products. 1344 | Nat.

Early total syntheses of the napyradiomycins In 1999, Nakata and co-workers reported the \ue103rst total synthesis of a napyradiomycin natural product, A80915G (8).18 Nakata anticipated that the geranyl and prenyl substituents of 8 could be installed using sequential Stille reactions of a trihalogenated benzene derivative, followed by an intermolecular Diels\u2013Alder reaction to form the desired naphthoquinone core (Scheme 2). The synthesis began with commercially available 2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitroaniline (101) which was converted into the chlorinated intermediate 102 over two steps. Successive bromination and iodination (via intermediate 103), formed the trihalogenated 1,4-dimethoxybenzene derivative 104 in four steps. A\ue09der extensive optimisation of the reaction conditions, the selective Pd cata-lysed Stille cross-coupling between geranyl tributyltin 105 and 104 occurred exclusively at the C\u2013I bond to give 106. Prenylation with the analogous prenyl tributyltin 107 under similar Stille reaction conditions was then selective for the C\u2013Br over the C\u2013Cl bond of 106, affording 108 in good yield. Oxidative demethyla-tion with AgNO3 gave the unstable quinone 109, which was immediately subjected to an intermolecular Diels\u2013Alder reac-tion. Several dienes were assessed, however a successful cyclo-addition was only achieved between quinone 109 and Brassard diene 110, with the desired aromatised adduct 111 formed a\ue09der treatment with aqueous HCl and heating in DMF.

Formylation of 115 was achieved by ortho-lithiation of the amido group followed by a quench with DMF, and addition of PhSO2Na to the resultant aldehyde then gave lactone 116. Methoxymethyl (MOM) protection of the free phenols of 116 then afforded 117. With this intermediate in hand, the key Hauser annulation, which follows a Michael\u2013 Dieckmann cascade mechanism, was achieved by deprotona-tion of 117 with t-BuOLi, followed by addition of the Michael acceptor 118. The initially formed hydroquinone was then oxi-dised with MnO2 to afford naphthoquinone 119. a-Chlorination of 119 with SOCl2 gave 120, and then installation of the geranyl side chain at C-3 was achieved by a Michael addition of a ger-anyllithium species, generated in situ by transmetallation of geranyl tributyltin (121). The Michael addition reaction was favoured on the opposite face to the C-12 chlorine substituent, giving intermediate 122 with good diastereoselectivity. Selective deoxygenation of 122 at C-11 proved difficult by direct methods, demanding the use of a four-step protocol. Ketone 122 was \ue103rst chlorinated with NCS to give intermediate 123, followed by reduction with KHBPh3 to afford alcohol 124. Treatment with 2,20-dipyridyldisul\ue103de and tributylphosphine afforded a,b-unsaturated ketone 125, followed by selective 1,4 hydride reduction with KHBPh3 to give 126.

The synthesis of 2 was ach-ieved by an alkali fusion reaction of commercially available chromotropic acid sodium salt (127). The initially formed THN (1) was readily oxidised in air at room temperature to form 2. With the naphthoquinone core of the napyradiomycins already established, treatment of 2 with 3-methylcrotonaldehyde (128) and EDDA resulted in successive Knoevenagel condensation and oxa-6p-electrocyclisation reactions to give a chromene intermediate that was selectively MOM protected at the non-hydrogen bonded C-6 phenol to give 129. Asymmetric alkene chlorination was then accomplished with Cl2, BH3$THF and AcOH in the presence of the chiral ligand (S)-130 to afford the vicinal dichloride 131 in excellent yield and enantioselectivity. Substitution of the C-11 chloride substituent with acetate occurred with retention of stereochemistry to give 132, which was O-methylated and hydrolysed to give 133. The key alkyl substituent at C-3 was then introduced using an acid-catalysed Johnson\u2013Claisen rearrangement employing excess CH3-C(OMe)3. The [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of the interme-diate enol ether 134 afforded methyl ester 135 with the desired relative con\ue103guration at C-3. A series of functional group interconversions then converted methyl ester 135 to aldehyde 136 in three steps. Wittig ole\ue103nation of 136 with the ylide derived from phosphonium salt 137 gave the geranylated intermediate 138.

Furthermore, each of these total syntheses highlights the utility of MOM protecting groups for the C-6 and C-8 phenols, which can be removed under mildly acidic conditions. This protecting group strategy was later used in successful biomimetic syntheses of the napyradiomycins and marinones. 5. Biosynthetic studies and biomimetic total syntheses of the merochlorins Merochlorins A and B were the \ue103rst THN-based meroterpenoids to have their biosyntheses fully established. This insight would eventually lead to several biomimetic syntheses as well as a one-pot enzymatic total synthesis. Moreover, the establishment of the merochlorin biosynthetic logic would ultimately help unlock many questions in how meroterpenoids are universally assembled in nature. Fenical and Moore combined forces to report the structures and biosynthesis genes of the merochlorin family of molecules in 2012.9 The 57 kb merochlorin biosyn-thetic gene clustermcl was cloned and successfully expressed in the heterologous host strain Streptomyces coelicolor to produce the merochlorins. Together with gene knockout experiments in the native Streptomyces CNH-189 strain on the THN synthase-encoding mcl17, these studies identi\ue103ed the genes responsible for the construction of the merochlorin molecules. That foun-dational genetic work led to the biochemical characterisation of four enzymes responsible for converting \ue103ve molecules of Scheme 5 Biosynthesis of merochlorins A (5) and B (58).

The branched isoprene unit was shown to be assembled from an unusual head-to-torso condensation of 140 and 141 to give the newly identi\ue103ed isoprene building block isosesquilavandulyl pyrophosphate (142) by the Mcl22 prenyltransferase.60,61 The C-4 alkylation of THN (1) with the branched sesquiterpene substrate 142 was shown to be highly preferred over FPP by the prenyltransferase Mcl23 to give pre-merochlorin (143). Quite extraordinarily, the VHPO enzyme Mcl24 singlehandedly converted 143 to mero-chlorins A (5) and B (58). Synthetically, this cascade of reactions began with C-2 mono-chlorination of pre-merochlorin (143) to give 144. Subsequent oxidative dearomatisation gave carbocation 145, which a\ue09der cyclisation to 146, could then undergo stepwise [5 + 2] or [3 + 2] cycloaddition to give merochlorin A (5) or B (58), respectively. These enzymes, substrates, and cofactors could also be bundled together into a single reaction vessel to achieve the efficient enzymatic total synthesis of the merochlorins. Intriguingly, the structural complexity initiated by Mcl24 in the construction of merochlorins A and B showed further chemical diversity depending on the reaction pH.62,63 At all interrogated pHs in the presence of its requisite cosubstrates and cofactors, Mcl24 catalyses the C-2 mono-chlorination and oxidative dearomatisation of pre-merochlorin (143). However, under mildly basic conditions (pH 8.0), the dearomatised intermediate is preferentially hydrated at C-4 to give tertiary alcohol 147 instead of being intercepted by an alkene carbon (Scheme 6). Performing the reaction in the presence of H2 18O supported the hypothesis that water was the source of this C-4 Nat. Prod.

Mcl24 then facilitates a second chlorina-tion at C-2 on this dearomatised substrate 147 to give 148, and a subsequent enzyme-catalysed a-hydroxyketone rearrange-ment to give 149. This novel in vitro metabolite 149 possesses a di-chlorinated naphthoquinone moiety and C-3 attached prenyl substituent. This 1,2-suprafacial shi\ue09d is thermodynam-ically favorable only following di-substitution at the C-2 position in the THN-derived ring, established via both computational and experimental analyses.63 While unexpected, the chemical logic established within this pH-dependent 1,2-alkyl shi\ue09d rationalised the biosynthesis of the abundant C-3 prenylated metabolites within this natural product family. Initial biosyn-thetic hypotheses suggested that \u201cpromiscuous\u201d prenyl-transferases were responsible for this chemically counterintuitive electrophilic prenylation on an electrophilic C-3 carbonyl-derived carbon.58 Instead, this prenylation, dear-omatisation and a-hydroxyketone rearrangement sequence constructs the substitution pattern present in many of these THN-derived meroterpenoids. The chemical logic established within the pH dependence of Mcl24 further rationalised the biosynthesis of merochlorins C (59) and D (60), the two naphthoquinone metabolites isolated from this family. However, instead of Mcl24-catalysed C-2 dihalogenation, the mono-chlorinated, dearomatised, and hydrated product 147 would be methylated at C-2 Scheme 7 Proposed biosynthesis of merochlorins C (59) and D (60). 1348 | Nat.

Genetic evidence has implicated mcl40, a second merochlorin VHPO gene, in the entropically-challenging 15-membered macrocyclic chloro-ether ring formation in the biosynthesis of merochlorin C (59).59 However, any production of 59 by this putative activity has yet to be con\ue103rmed using in vitro recombinant enzymology due to protein insolubility and expression issues. The \ue103rst total synthesis of merochlorin A completed in 2013 by Pepper and George closely anticipated its biosynthetic pathway.64 Pivotal to the success of the synthesis was the early introduction of the merochlorin A chlorine substituent at C-2 via the Friedel\u2013Cra\ue09ds acylation of methyl 3,5-dimethox-yphenylacetate (151) with chloroacetyl chloride to give chlor-oketone 152 (Scheme 8).

Unexpectedly, some isomerisation of the C14\u2013C15 alkene occurred during the alkylation under basic conditions. Oxida-tive dearomatisation of 155 with Pb(OAc)4 in CHCl3 then gave 156, the dimethyl ether of merochlorin A, in 50% yield.

Finally, deprotection of 156 was achieved via two successive Krapcho demethylations to give racemic mero-chlorin A (5). Shortly a\ue09der the \ue103rst total synthesis of merochlorin A, Trauner and co-workers reported the \ue103rst synthesis of mero-chlorin B,65 which followed a similar biosynthetically-inspired blueprint (Scheme 9). Friedel\u2013Cra\ue09ds acylation of 151 using acetyl chloride gave 157, which was aromatised under basic conditions to give the THN derivative 158. Tandem silylation of 158 followed by directed lithiation and chlorination at C-2 gave 159, which was selectively demethylated using BBr3 in the presence of proton sponge to give naphthol 160. Alkylation of 160 at C-4 using alkyl bromide 154 gave 161, the substrate for the key oxidative cyclisation. Although the structure of 161 is very similar to compound 155 used in the George synthesis of merochlorin A, the outcome of oxidative dearomatisation was very different in this case, as treatment with a variant of Koser's reagent PhI(OH)OTs (generated in situ) gave the protected merochlorin B derivative 162. Clearly, the methyl ether Scheme 9 Trauner's biomimetic total synthesis of (None)-merochlorin B (5 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 substituent of 161 favours the [3 + 2] instead of the [5 + 2] cyc-lisation pathway by decreasing the nuclophilicity of the C-2 position, and no merochlorin A scaffolds were formed in the oxidative cyclisation. Finally, desilylation of 162 using TBAF completed this concise total synthesis of racemic merochlorin B (58). Alongside their elucidation of merochlorin biosynthesis, the Moore group reported a highly divergent and protecting-group-free biomimetic synthesis of merochlorins A and B, plus several analogues (Scheme 10).66 Conjugate addition of in situ generated lithium dimethyl cuprate to ethyl 2-butynoate (163) followed by quenching of the resultant enolate with geranyl bromide (164) gave ester 165, which was reduced with DIBAL-H to give isosesquilavandulol (166). Conversion of 166 into its carbonate 167 allowed its direct coupling to unpro-tected THN (1) via a Pd catalysed allylation in the presence of BEt3 to give pre-merochlorin (143). Notably, these Pd catalysed coupling conditions did not cause partial isomerisation of the C14\u2013C15 alkene, unlike previous merochlorin total syntheses.

View Article OnlineOxidation of 178 with I2 in MeOH gave di-O-methylated mero-chlorin A (156), which was deprotected to give racemic mero-chlorin A (5) using LiCl in DMF according to George's two-step procedure. Synthesis of merochlorin B (58) was achieved from tricycle 176 via a similar sequence involving intermolecular Diels\u2013Alder reaction with Brassard diene 177, followed by Sae-gusa oxidation and LiCl-mediated demethylation. More recently, the Carreira group achieved the \ue103rst enantio-selective total synthesis of merochlorin A using a non-biomimetic approach (Scheme 12).68 Their synthesis was designed around a key Au(I)-catalysed cascade reaction of an enynyl acetate intermediate 184. This intermediate was prepared via a modi\ue103ed Wittig\u2013Schlosser reaction between the ylide formed from triphenylphosphonium bromide 179 and aldehyde 180. The resultant E-alkenyl iodide 181 was coupled with (R)-182 using a Sonogashira reaction to give 183, which was converted into the key substrate 184 via a series of functional group interconversions. Notably, from this point in the synthesis the sole stereocentre of 184 dictated the formation of (None)-mero-chlorin A as a single stereoisomer. Au(I)-catalysed cyclisation of 184 using catalyst 185 gave bicyclic ketone 186 via a spectacular cascade featuring successive 1,3-acyloxy migration, Nazarov cyclisation and aldol reaction steps. Tri\ue104ation and elimination of the secondary alcohol of 186 followed by Tsuji\u2013Wacker oxidation gave diketone 187, which underwent La(III)-mediated Grignard addition of isopropenylmagnesium bromide to the most reactive carbonyl followed by reduction to give tetra-substituted alkene 188.

Heating 234 with MgBr2 in MeCN induced the desired retro-6p-electrocyclisation and alkene iso-merisation to give the reactive enone 216, which then under-went an intramolecular hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction to form debromomarinone (79). Cleavage of the labile C-8 methyl ether was also observed under these reaction conditions. Finally, bromination with NBS occurred exclusively at C-7 to furnish isomarinone (80). Total syntheses of 7-demethylnaphterpin (71), naphterpin (66), and naphterpins B (67) and C (68) were also achieved using this Diels\u2013Alder-based strategy. 9. Biosynthesis and total synthesis of the furaquinocins and neomarinone Early isotope labelling studies showed that the furaquinocins were similarly constructed around a symmetric THN precursor, and structurally elaborated with mevalonate-derived terpenes and methyl and methoxy substituents derived from the two C1 units of L-methionine.56 The Dairi group later reported the fur-aquinocin BGC in 2006 via heterologous expression of the 25 kb fur cluster in Streptomyces lividans TK23 to produce fur-aquinocin D (85).11 The biosynthesis has largely been proposed based on genetic manipulation and comparison to known enzymes in other meroterpenoid biosynthetic pathways. Other than the putative THN synthase (fur1), key genes were identi\ue103ed such as C-methyltransferase fur4, O-methyltransferase fur6, prenyltransferase fur7, and cytochrome P450 enzyme fur8. With this knowledge, the predicted biosynthetic pathway is as out-lined in Scheme 24. In contrast to the other described mer-oterpenoid biosyntheses wherein THN prenylation precedes further oxidation dearomatisation or halogenation reactions, in furaquinocin biosynthesis, monooxygenase Fur2 oxidises half of the naphthalene ring system to \ue104aviolin (2), which is then C-and O-methylated to generate 2-methoxy-3-methyl\ue104aviolin (235). Further investigation by Kuzuyama and co-workers into prenyltransferase Fur7 via heterologous protein expression con\ue103rmed 235 to be the preferred in vitro substrate when incubated with GPP and independent of divalent cations.14 Intriguingly, two compounds, Fur-P1 (236) and Fur-P2 (237), were produced in a 10 : 1 ratio, indicating that Fur7 has the Scheme 24 Proposed biosynthesis of the furaquinocins.

View Article Onlineazamerone (57) clearly showed 13C enrichment at C-8 and 15N enrichment at N-2, thus proving that the pyridazine ring of 57 is derived from the diazo group of 24. Presently, the mecha-nism for the conversion of 47 into 57 is unclear, although it could involve oxidative cleavage of the diazonaphthoquinone ring system of A80915D (47), followed by a 1,2-shi\ue09d of the monoterpene unit from C-4 to C-3. The pyridazine ring system could then be formed by cyclisation of the intermediate dike-tone 292, followed by aromatisation via dehydration and decarboxylation steps to give 57. The \ue103rst total synthesis of azamerone was reported in 2019 by Burns and co-workers, who employed an enantioselective, convergent approach that uni\ue103ed boronic hemiester and quinone diazide coupling partners (Scheme 32).87 The \ue103rst enantioenriched building block, the boronic hemiester, was prepared from geranyl acetate (293) in four steps. Racemic chlorocyclisation of 293 using a two-step strategy previously developed by Snyder gave chlorocycle 294. Resolution of (None)-294 by chiral derivatisation with (S)-a-methoxyphenylacetic acid gave diastereomeric esters that were separable by \ue104ash chro-matography. A\ue09der ester hydrolysis, chlorocycle 294 was ob-tained in 90% ee. Dehydration of 294 then gave exocyclic alkene 295, which was hydroborated to give the stable boronic hemi-ester 296. Quinone diazide building block was synthesised from prenylquinone 297 using an enantioselective choroether-i\ue103cation catalysed by a chiral titanium complex derived from ligand 298. The resultant chloropyran 299 was formed in 40% yield and 84% ee. Although the stereoselectivity and efficiency of this chloroetheri\ue103cation reaction is modest, it is to date the closest synthetic equivalent of the NapH4-catalysed Scheme 32 Burns's total synthesis of (None)-azamerone (57).87 Scheme 33 Gademann's synthetic approach to azamerone (57).88 Review Natural Product Reports Pu bl is he d on  30 Ju ne  202 0.

        "1. Introduction Meroterpenoids are natural products of mixed biosynthetic origin that are formed in part from a terpenoid co-substrate.1 These hybrid molecules are broadly produced in nature by bacteria, fungi, plants, algae and animals and combine terpenoid building blocks with polyketides, phenols, alkaloids, and amino acids to achieve amazing chemical diversity.2\u20135 Some notable examples include the cofactor ubiquinone andmedicines such as vincristine, mycophenolic acid and tetrahydrocannabinol. During the past four decades, several families of naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoids have been discovered from marine and soil-derived streptomycete bacteria.6 These natural products have been linked, through both biosynthetic speculation and 13C-labelling studies, to 1,3,6,8-tetrahydrox-ynaphthalene (THN, 1) as the key aromatic polyketide building block (Scheme 1). In bacteria, THN is biosynthesised by the condensation and aromatisation of \ue103ve malonyl coenzyme A subunits under the control of a THN synthase.7 Bacterial THN synthases possess a simple, type III polyketide synthase homodimeric structure.8 Several THN synthases have been implicated in the biosynthesis of bacterial meroterpenoids,",

THN undergoes spontaneous aerobic oxidation to give \ue104aviolin (2), which shares a super\ue103cial similarity in structure to several bacterial meroterpenoids such as the furaquinocins (e.g. fur-aquinocin A,12 3) and the napyradiomycins (e.g. napyradiomycin B1,13 4). Indeed, biosynthetic studies have shown that \ue104aviolin is a likely biosynthetic precursor of the furaquinocins.11,14 However, it has recently been shown that most marine mer-oterpenoids \u2013 such as the merochlorins (e.g.merochlorin A,9 5), marinones (e.g. marinone,15 6) and napyradiomycins \u2013 are rather derived directly from THN itself, with oxidation, halo-genation and cyclisation steps occurring a\ue09der the initial pre-nylation of THN.

        "Onlinewe present the early 13C-biosynthetic labelling studies of THN meroterpenoids, which gave valuable information on the origin of the polyketide and terpene building blocks, but not enough to fully elucidate the biosynthetic pathways. As a consequence, the pioneering total syntheses of napyradiomycins by Nakata,18 Tatsuta19 and Snyder20 were uninformed by \ue103rm knowledge of their biosynthesis. Thirdly, and in a roughly linear narrative, we describe how the advent of genome analysis has transformed studies on the biosynthesis and total synthesis of complex meroterpenoids. Three case studies on the merochlorins, the napyradiomycins and the marinones are presented in which the discovery of unique prenyltransferase and vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase (VCPO) enzymes from the respective gene clusters allowed the biosynthetic jigsaw puzzles to be solved piece by piece. This biosynthetic work directly inspired biomi-metic total syntheses of THN-derived meroterpenoids by several research groups, in addition to a fully enzymatic total synthesis of napyradiomycins A1 and B1. The use of a unique combina-tion of polyketide synthase, prenyltransferase and VCPO enzymes in one-pot synthetic operations represents the ideal end point in the total synthesis of THN meroterpenoids, although challenges remain in terms of scalability and product diversi\ue103cation in the synthesis of the napyradiomycins. Finally, biosynthetic and synthetic work on the furaquinocins and azamerone are summarised. In both cases, the \ue103nal key steps of the biosynthetic pathways are unknown, which presents future opportunities for the discovery of new enzymes and biomimetic chemical reactions.",

        "considered to be functionalised derivatives of naphthomevalin (7) (Fig. 1). For example, halocyclisation of the C-2 prenyl substituent gives a large group of tricyclic napyradiomycins with a 6,6,6 ring system, while the C-3 geranyl group can also undergo halocyclisation to form an additional cyclohexane ring. The C-7 position of the le\ue09d hand aromatic ring can be methyl-ated or not, while the C-5 position can undergo amination and diazotisation to form a series of unusual diazoketone natural products. Intramolecular substitution of the C-2 chlorine substituent with the C-3 tertiary alcohol can form epoxide natural products, or it can be eliminated to introduce further unsaturation. Finally, allylic oxidation of the C-3 geranyl group can occur at various positions, with oxidative macrocyclisation on this substituent also possible. Many combinations of these functionalisations can occur in biosynthesis, which leads to the great diversity of napyradiomycins found in nature. The simplest, bicyclic napyradiomycin meroterpenoids are shown in Fig. 2. Naphthomevalin (7) itself was isolated from a culture broth of a Streptomyces sp. strain Go\u0308 28, originally found in a soil sample collected at Strathgordon, Australia.

Early biosynthetic studies The early biosynthetic studies of the naphthoquinone-based streptomycete meroterpenoids focused on stable isotope label-ling with 13C-labelled acetate to establish their biosynthetic origins. In 1987, Shiomi and colleagues reported preliminary isotope incorporation results with the napyradiomycins only a year a\ue09der they were \ue103rst reported.29 Feeding experiments with [2-13C]acetate and [1,2-13C]acetate established that the napyr-adiomycins are derived from a symmetrical pentaketide, such as 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN, 1), and two isoprenes, namely the \ue103ve-carbon dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and the ten-carbon geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) (Fig. 16). Moreover, the enriched 13C-NMR signals in the napyradiomycin molecules allowed for the authors to reassign multiple carbon assignments in napyradiomycins A1 and C4. Soon therea\ue09der, two reports in 1990 by the laboratories of Seto and Omura similarly showed that naphterpin (66)55 and the furaquinocins,56 respectively, most likely also originate from the coupling of THN and GPP precursors (Fig. 17 and 18). In all three examples, the isotope labelling patterns established that the isoprene units originate from the mevalonate pathway. Debromomarinone (79) and neomarinone (99) offered a slight departure regarding the origin of their isoprene units as reported by Moore in 2003.53 While 13C-acetate symmetrically labelled the naphthoquinone moieties indicative of a THN building block, the sesquiterpene-derived carbons of 79 and 99 showed no enrichment (Fig. 19). Feeding experiments with 13C-labelled glucose alternatively enriched the terpenoid fragments consistent with a non-mevalonate or methyl D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway origin of its farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) precursor. The 13C-enrichment in the isoprene sidechain of 99 moreover had the added bene\ue103t of revealing that the original structure proposed by Fenical46 was incorrect and should be revised as depicted in Fig. 19.53 The \ue103rst connection of clustered biosynthesis genes to chemistry for a naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoid from",

The following year, the Moore group discovered and validated the napyradiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster via heterologous expression studies.10 These early meroterpenoid gene cluster studies con\ue103rmed that the common THN frag-ment is derived from a type III polyketide synthase, namely THN synthase, that had only been discovered in bacteria a few years prior by Horinouchi and colleagues.7 THN synthase is a homodimeric enzyme8 responsible for pigmented melanin production in Streptomyces bacteria in addition to being integral in meroterpenoid biosynthesis.

Early total syntheses of the napyradiomycins In 1999, Nakata and co-workers reported the \ue103rst total synthesis of a napyradiomycin natural product, A80915G (8).18 Nakata anticipated that the geranyl and prenyl substituents of 8 could be installed using sequential Stille reactions of a trihalogenated benzene derivative, followed by an intermolecular Diels\u2013Alder reaction to form the desired naphthoquinone core (Scheme 2). The synthesis began with commercially available 2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitroaniline (101) which was converted into the chlorinated intermediate 102 over two steps. Successive bromination and iodination (via intermediate 103), formed the trihalogenated 1,4-dimethoxybenzene derivative 104 in four steps. A\ue09der extensive optimisation of the reaction conditions, the selective Pd cata-lysed Stille cross-coupling between geranyl tributyltin 105 and 104 occurred exclusively at the C\u2013I bond to give 106. Prenylation with the analogous prenyl tributyltin 107 under similar Stille reaction conditions was then selective for the C\u2013Br over the C\u2013Cl bond of 106, affording 108 in good yield. Oxidative demethyla-tion with AgNO3 gave the unstable quinone 109, which was immediately subjected to an intermolecular Diels\u2013Alder reac-tion.

The initially formed THN (1) was readily oxidised in air at room temperature to form 2. With the naphthoquinone core of the napyradiomycins already established, treatment of 2 with 3-methylcrotonaldehyde (128) and EDDA resulted in successive Knoevenagel condensation and oxa-6p-electrocyclisation reactions to give a chromene intermediate that was selectively MOM protected at the non-hydrogen bonded C-6 phenol to give 129. Asymmetric alkene chlorination was then accomplished with Cl2, BH3$THF and AcOH in the presence of the chiral ligand (S)-130 to afford the vicinal dichloride 131 in excellent yield and enantioselectivity. Substitution of the C-11 chloride substituent with acetate occurred with retention of stereochemistry to give 132, which was O-methylated and hydrolysed to give 133. The key alkyl substituent at C-3 was then introduced using an acid-catalysed Johnson\u2013Claisen rearrangement employing excess CH3-C(OMe)3. The [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of the interme-diate enol ether 134 afforded methyl ester 135 with the desired relative con\ue103guration at C-3. A series of functional group interconversions then converted methyl ester 135 to aldehyde 136 in three steps. Wittig ole\ue103nation of 136 with the ylide derived from phosphonium salt 137 gave the geranylated intermediate 138. Installation of the C-2 chlorine was then achieved using Tatsuta's conditions to generate compound 139, and \ue103nally a two-step deprotection protocol yielded (None)-napyr-adiomycin A1 (14).

        "5. Biosynthetic studies and biomimetic total syntheses of the merochlorins Merochlorins A and B were the \ue103rst THN-based meroterpenoids to have their biosyntheses fully established. This insight would eventually lead to several biomimetic syntheses as well as a one-pot enzymatic total synthesis. Moreover, the establishment of the merochlorin biosynthetic logic would ultimately help unlock many questions in how meroterpenoids are universally assembled in nature. Fenical and Moore combined forces to report the structures and biosynthesis genes of the merochlorin family of molecules in 2012.9 The 57 kb merochlorin biosyn-thetic gene clustermcl was cloned and successfully expressed in the heterologous host strain Streptomyces coelicolor to produce the merochlorins. Together with gene knockout experiments in the native Streptomyces CNH-189 strain on the THN synthase-encoding mcl17, these studies identi\ue103ed the genes responsible for the construction of the merochlorin molecules.

The branched isoprene unit was shown to be assembled from an unusual head-to-torso condensation of 140 and 141 to give the newly identi\ue103ed isoprene building block isosesquilavandulyl pyrophosphate (142) by the Mcl22 prenyltransferase.60,61 The C-4 alkylation of THN (1) with the branched sesquiterpene substrate 142 was shown to be highly preferred over FPP by the prenyltransferase Mcl23 to give pre-merochlorin (143). Quite extraordinarily, the VHPO enzyme Mcl24 singlehandedly converted 143 to mero-chlorins A (5) and B (58). Synthetically, this cascade of reactions began with C-2 mono-chlorination of pre-merochlorin (143) to give 144. Subsequent oxidative dearomatisation gave carbocation 145, which a\ue09der cyclisation to 146, could then undergo stepwise [5 + 2] or [3 + 2] cycloaddition to give merochlorin A (5) or B (58), respectively. These enzymes, substrates, and cofactors could also be bundled together into a single reaction vessel to achieve the efficient enzymatic total synthesis of the merochlorins. Intriguingly, the structural complexity initiated by Mcl24 in the construction of merochlorins A and B showed further chemical diversity depending on the reaction pH.62,63 At all interrogated pHs in the presence of its requisite cosubstrates and cofactors, Mcl24 catalyses the C-2 mono-chlorination and oxidative dearomatisation of pre-merochlorin (143). However, under mildly basic conditions (pH 8.0), the dearomatised intermediate is preferentially hydrated at C-4 to give tertiary alcohol 147 instead of being intercepted by an alkene carbon (Scheme 6). Performing the reaction in the presence of H2 18O supported the hypothesis that water was the source of this C-4",

The \ue103rst total synthesis of merochlorin A completed in 2013 by Pepper and George closely anticipated its biosynthetic pathway.64 Pivotal to the success of the synthesis was the early introduction of the merochlorin A chlorine substituent at C-2 via the Friedel\u2013Cra\ue09ds acylation of methyl 3,5-dimethox-yphenylacetate (151) with chloroacetyl chloride to give chlor-oketone 152 (Scheme 8).

Other than the putative THN synthase (fur1), key genes were identi\ue103ed such as C-methyltransferase fur4, O-methyltransferase fur6, prenyltransferase fur7, and cytochrome P450 enzyme fur8. With this knowledge, the predicted biosynthetic pathway is as out-lined in Scheme 24.
