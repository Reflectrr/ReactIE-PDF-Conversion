Chemis-try is in need of a regioselective halogenation catalyst, and this workillustrates the potential and recent gains made towards using en-zymes for this goal.Key words: halogenation, catalysis, enzymes, directed evolution,protein engineeringWhile only 200 halogenated natural products were knownin 1973, today over 4000 have been discovered.1 Alongwith this increased awareness of halogenation in the natu-ral world, there has been an increased application of halo-genation in research and industry. Today, halogenation isa ubiquitous and vital process in the development of bio-logically active compounds; an estimated one quarter ofall pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals are halogenated.2In addition, halogenated intermediates are common inpharmaceutical synthesis, especially as substrates forcross-coupling reactions,3 of which examples abound inboth drug discovery4,5 and industrial-scale drug produc-tion.6 Aside from synthetic utility, halogenation can alsolead to drastic changes in the biological activity of com-pounds. This point is illustrated by the effects of chlorina-tion or bromination in drugs as diverse as antibiotics,7apoptosis inhibitors,8 and psychoactive compounds9 (Fig-ure 1). Halogenation has also been demonstrated to havea profound impact on the metabolic properties of drugcompounds10 and, as such, is widely employed duringlead optimization and drug design to improve pharmaco-kinetic profiles. In a particularly notable example, the mi-crosomal clearance of over 220,000 compounds wasexamined, and it was observed that chlorination at one po-sition could increase the metabolic half-life of a drug,while chlorination at different positions would decreasethe metabolic half-life.10Despite the utility of halogenated compounds, currentmethods to install halogen atoms leave much to be de-sired, since they often require prefunctionalized or acti-vated starting materials, or lengthy, wasteful, multistepfunctional group conversion sequences.11 For example, ar-omatic halogenation is commonly accomplished by elec-trophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which, in additionto requiring harsh, environmentally unfriendly reagentsand reaction conditions, cannot selectively halogenateelectronically disfavored positions, and can lead to prod-uct mixtures.12 This often renders EAS unsuitable for thederivitization of drug leads. Whereas a number of oxida-tive methods have been developed to mitigate the environ-mental impact of EAS, none of these approaches offer asolution to the lack of site-selectivity.13 To this day, explo-ration of halogenated derivatives of drug leads often relieson time-consuming and expensive syntheses from avail-able halogenated starting materials, in many cases neces-sitating a unique synthetic path to explore each differentlyhalogenated analogue.9Not surprisingly, given the importance and paucity of ex-isting options for selective halogenation, several groupshave explored potential methods for this transformation.In 2010, the Hartwig group published a method for site-James Payne(left) received his BS in chemistry in 2010 from theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, from which he also re-ceived a BA in astronomy in the same year and worked under thementorship of Prof. You-Hua Chu.

Jared Lewis (right) received his BS in chemistry in 2002 from theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he worked underthe mentorship of Prof. Eric Oldfield. He then earned his PhD in 2007from the University of California, Berkeley under the joint guidanceof Prof. Robert Bergman and Prof. John Ellman. From 2007 to 2010he was a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technologyin the lab of Prof. Frances Arnold. In 2010, Prof. Lewis joined the fac-ulty at the University of Chicago. His research focuses on the catalyticfunctionalization of C\u2013H bonds that are difficult to functionalize withcurrent methods, and his lab takes three main approaches toward thisgoal: organometallic chemistry, the directed evolution of natural en-zymes, and the development of artificial metalloenzymes.SYNLETT 2014, 25, 1345\u20131349Advanced online publication:03.04.20140 9 3 6 -5 2 1 4 1 4 3 7 -2 0 9 6 DOI: 10.1055/s-0033-1341024; ArtID: ST-2013-P1118-SP \u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag  Stuttgart \u00b7 New YorkD ow nl oa de d by : Uni ve rs ity  of Ill in oi s.

Halogenation,however, requires a three-step sequence of ruthenium-cat-alyzed silyation of the indole nitrogen, iridium-catalyzedborylation of the indole 7-position, and copper-catalyzedhalogenation. Although the 7-chlorination of indole wasaccomplished in this manner, this method illustrates thedifficulty of traditional chemocatalytic, site-selective ha-logenation. Five steps and three metals are required, andthe indole nitrogen is used as a directing group \u2013 indolesfunctionalized at the 1-position would not be compatiblewith this method. Furthermore, only the 7-position isfunctionalized by this method, and modifying this proce-dure to allow 6-, 5-, or 4-borylation would prove difficultor impossible. From this, we see that an optimal halogena-tion catalyst is not only site-selective, but also easily mod-ifiable in its site-selectivity. In addition, an optimalcatalyst is also efficient, scalable, environmentally be-nign, and tolerant of a wide range of substrates (and fur-thermore, modifiable in its substrate scope). Thesecharacteristics are hard to find together in a catalyst forany reaction, let alone halogenation.Thankfully, there already exist catalysts that fulfill manyof these criteria. Natural enzymes capable of oxidative ha-logenation have been discovered;15 among these, a sub-class of enzymes called FAD-dependent halogenases(FDHs) are able to perform regioselective arene halogena-tions.16 Their regioselectivity arises from the fact that theactive halogenating intermediate, a haloamine adductformed with an active site lysine residue, is proximal onlyto a single C\u2013H bond on the bound substrate.17 TheseFDHs utilize sodium chloride instead of chlorine gas as achlorine source, operate in water at room temperaturerather than in chlorinated solvents at high temperaturesand pressures, and use no heavy metals, which is especial-ly attractive in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, for whichthe removal of residual metals can be expensive and re-duce yield.18 Because these FDHs are genetically encodedcatalysts, they can be altered through the process of direct-ed evolution.19 In this process, mutations are introducedinto the genetic code, the resultant mutant enzymes arescreened for improved properties, and those that are im-proved are used as the starting point for another round ofmutation and selection. This process may be repeated asmany times as necessary to obtain a mutant with suffi-ciently improved properties. The enzymes themselves areinherently green and regioselective, while the process ofdirected evolution offers the facile modifiability of thesubstrate scope, regioselectivity, and other properties thatare necessary components of an ideal catalyst.Particularly notable are several tryptophan halogenases,which are capable of selectively halogenating the 5-, 6-, or7-position on the indole ring; of these, the tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA20 and RebH21 are the most studied(Scheme 1). This natural tryptophan 7-halogenation hasbeen exploited for the derivatization of drug molecules bythe Goss group, who integrated PrnA into the biosyntheticpathway for pacidamycin, a uridyl peptide antibiotic.22The resultant chloropacidamycin was further derivatizedby using cross-coupling chemistry to produce a range ofarylated pacidamycin analogues. However, the utility ofthis method is limited to derivatizing products that inte-grate L-tryptophan into their synthetic pathways, and theability to use halogenases on other substrates would sub-stantially increase the number of accessible compounds.The substrate scope of wild-type PrnA has been explored,and it was found to halogenate a range of substituted in-doles, including N-\u2126-methyltryptamine, 5-methyltrypt-amine, and 3-and 5-methylindole.23 With the exception ofthe native substrate L-tryptophan, however, the other in-dole substrates were all halogenated at the most electron-ically activated 2-position. In addition, several othersubstrates tested were not halogenated, including gra-mine, 1-methyltryptamine, and indole itself. Whereastryptophan itself is not the most interesting target for ha-Figure 1 Examples of aromatic halogenation improving biologicalactivity.

The first piece of evidence that RebHmight be a useful alternative for regioselectivity camefrom the O\u2019Connor group. This group had previously in-tegrated RebH into the alkaloid-producing plant Mada-gascar periwinkle in order to produce halogenatedalkaloids, but they found a buildup of 7-chlorotryptophan,because tryptophan decarboxylase is a bottleneck for al-kaloid production.24 To avoid this bottleneck, the authorssought to halogenate tryptamine directly, rather than ex-ploit tryptophan halogenation followed by subsequent de-carboxylation.25 Several active site residues were mutatedto a range of different amino acids until a mutant wasfound that preferentially halogenated tryptamine overtryptophan. Characterization of the halogenated productshowed that tryptamine was selectively halogenated at the7-position, offering the first evidence of selective haloge-nation of an unnatural substrate at an electronically disfa-vored position.We then sought to explore the substrate scope of RebHeven further, both to reexamine the range of accepted sub-strates that were halogenated only at the 2-position byPrnA as well as those not accepted by PrnA, and to ex-plore new scaffolds in which we are interested. Because ofthe wide range of substrates we wished to test, and the pre-parative scale on which we wished to perform the reac-tions, it was first necessary to improve the expression ofRebH in E. coli. We focused on E. coli as a host becauseit is easily manipulated with high transformation efficien-cies, which greatly facilitates directed evolution. Throughcoexpression of RebH with the GroEL and GroES chaper-one proteins,26 more than 100mg of soluble enzyme wereisolated per liter of culture, which is more than a seven-fold improvement over the reported conditions.27 In addi-tion, RebF, the flavin reductase partner to RebH, was con-jugated to the maltose binding protein (MBP) solubilitytag.28 This MBP-RebF conjugate afforded more than elev-en-fold greater yields than those reported for RebF, andfortuitously retained full reductase activity without cleav-age of the MBP moiety. Using large quantities of both en-zymes obtained in this manner, along with a commerciallyavailable glucose dehydrogenase to complete the cofactorregeneration system,29 we began to explore the substratescope of wild-type RebH. In addition to the halogenationof L-tryptophan and tryptamine, both reported by O\u2019Con-nor, we found that RebH halogenated 5-methyltryptamineand N-\u2126-methyltryptamine as reported for PrnA. Further-more, RebH also halogenated gramine, 1-methyltrypt-amine, and indole, all of which PrnA was reported to notaccept, as well as D-tryptophan, tryptophol, 2-methyl-tryptamine, the tricyclic alkaloid tryptoline, and severalnaphthalenes, none of which had been tested as halogena-tion substrates for either RebH or PrnA. Most significant-ly, we performed 10mg scale bioconversions of eleven ofthese substrates, isolated and characterized the productsusing conventional chemical techniques (Figure 2), andfound that, unlike for PrnA, many of these substrates wereselectively halogenated at electronically disfavored posi-tions (Figure 3). In many of these cases, such as trypt-amine, tryptophol, and 2-methyltryptamine, only theproduct of 7-halogenation was observed, as seen for thenative substrate, L-tryptophan. For 5-methyltryptamine,however, only 6-halogenation was observed, whereas amix of 5-and 6-chlorinated products of tryptoline wereisolated. We think that these alternative selectivities willoffer useful synthetic starting points and provide insightsinto ways to alter the selectivity of RebH through directedevolution. Prior to our work on the expression enhancement of RebHin E. coli, studies on protein engineering, and especiallydirected evolution, of halogenases were greatly hinderedby low yields of soluble enzyme. To alter the behavior ofRebH with unnatural substrates, the O\u2019Connor group in-troduced a mutation to cause RebH to preferentially halo-genate tryptamine, as described above. To change theregioselectivity of PrnA, the vanP\u00e9e group changed a res-idue to one present in PyrH, a tryptophan 5-halogenase,and observed a mix of 7-and 5-halogenation in an approx-imately 2:1 ratio.30 Despite the fact that FDHs had beenknown for over a decade, these two studies representedthe limit of protein engineering to alter substrate scope orregioselectivity of FDHs, and no directed evolution hadbeen reported. Following our expression enhancement,we were able to obtain sufficient quantities of solubleRebH to perform the preparative-scale bioconversions de-scribed above, as well as a 100mg bioconversion of L-tryptophan by using the crude lysate from E. coli express-ing RebH to demonstrate the preparative utility of the en-Figure 2 Products of aromatic chlorination catalyzed by PrnA orRebH. PrnA-catalyzed chlorination occurs at the electronically mostactivated 2-position23 for both substrates, whereas RebH-catalyzedhalogenation occurs selectively at the 6-position for 5-methyltryptamine27 and the 7-position for N-\u2126-methyltryptamine(unpublished results); both sites are electronically disfavored relativeto the 2-position.N H N H N H N H Cl Cl Cl Cl NH2 HN Me NH2 HN Me PrnA productsRebH productsD ow nl oa de d by : Uni ve rs ity  of Ill in oi s.

Another effect of thisexpression enhancement was that reasonable levels ofconversion of L-tryptophan could be observed when thelysate from only 1 mL of culture was used. During direct-ed evolution, 96-well plates, in which each well contained1 mL of culture of a different mutant, were used for high-throughput protein expression and screening. Our expres-sion enhancement thus allowed us to begin the directedevolution of RebH.It has been shown that the thermostability of an enzymetends to promote its evolvability;31 random mutations in-troduced into an enzyme tend to be destabilizing, so themore stable the enzyme is initially, the higher the muta-tional load it can tolerate. As only single mutations hadbeen introduced to RebH in the past, we were unsure ofthe mutational load that RebH would tolerate and there-fore the extent to which mutations could be introduced toimprove various catalytic parameters of this enzyme. Ourgroup thus set out to improve the stability of RebH. By us-ing error-prone PCR, libraries of RebH mutants were gen-erated, which were expressed in 96-well culture plates andscreened (by high-throughput HPLC) for improved activ-ity after heat pre-treatment. By using this method, a mu-tant was found after three rounds of evolution with amelting temperature (measured by circular dichroism)nearly 18\u00b0C higher than wild-type RebH32 (Figure 4). Itwas further found that several thermostabilized mutantsgave higher conversions on several unnatural substrates atelevated temperatures, in several cases giving higher con-versions than wild-type RebH does at its optimal temper-ature, apparently owing to the longer life of these mutants.The thermostabilized mutants developed through this pro-cess offer a potentially improved starting point for evolv-ing other properties of RebH.Halogenases offer an environmentally benign, site-selec-tive alternative to conventional chemocatalytic tech-niques, which suffer from a lack of site-selectivity andrequire harsh reaction conditions. Natural halogenases arehindered in their application in the laboratory by their lowactivity and narrow substrate scope, and attempts to makehalogenases more useful through directed evolution have,in turn, been hindered by the low expression of soluble en-zyme in E. coli. By using chaperone proteins, our grouphas successfully overcome the low expression of solubleRebH, a tryptophan 7-halogenase, and demonstrated thatRebH is capable of site-selective halogenation of a re-markably broad range of substrates. Our group has alsoaccomplished the first reported directed evolution ofRebH, improving its thermostability as a starting point forsubsequent evolution. Future efforts will focus on the gen-eration of mutants to accomplish site-selective halogena-tions of complex drug targets to improve the biologicalactivities of these compounds, such as those described inthe introduction. Evolved halogenases will hopefully soonenable a biological exploration of many potentially inter-esting drug targets that would otherwise have been over-looked due to the difficulty of their syntheses.Acknowledgment We acknowledge financial support from the University of Chicago,the NIH through a Pathways to Independence Award(5R00GM087551), and the Searle Scholars Program (11-SSP-202).Figure 3 Products isolated from preparative-scale RebH-catalyzed aromatic halogenation reactions, with isolated yields shown (HPLC con-versions shown in parentheses)27N H NH2 CO2H X N H NH2 CO2H Cl X = Cl, 10 mg: 74% (94%)            100 mg: 69% (75%)       Br, 85% (97%)78% (99%)N H Cl N H R Cl N H NH2 Cl N H NH 53% (64%)R = NH2, 53% (98%)       NHMe, 65% (65%)      OH, 95% (95%)60% (96%)54% (58%)NH2 Cl OH Cl 93% (98%)59% (95%)N H NH2 Cl 58% (99%)Cl Figure 4 Thermal denaturation curves (measured by CD) of wild-type RebH and three thermostabilized mutants, showing an 18\u00b0C in-crease in Tm.

In a particularly notable example, the mi-crosomal clearance of over 220,000 compounds wasexamined, and it was observed that chlorination at one po-sition could increase the metabolic half-life of a drug,while chlorination at different positions would decreasethe metabolic half-life.10Despite the utility of halogenated compounds, currentmethods to install halogen atoms leave much to be de-sired, since they often require prefunctionalized or acti-vated starting materials, or lengthy, wasteful, multistepfunctional group conversion sequences.11 For example, ar-omatic halogenation is commonly accomplished by elec-trophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which, in additionto requiring harsh, environmentally unfriendly reagentsand reaction conditions, cannot selectively halogenateelectronically disfavored positions, and can lead to prod-uct mixtures.12 This often renders EAS unsuitable for thederivitization of drug leads. Whereas a number of oxida-tive methods have been developed to mitigate the environ-mental impact of EAS, none of these approaches offer asolution to the lack of site-selectivity.13 To this day, explo-ration of halogenated derivatives of drug leads often relieson time-consuming and expensive syntheses from avail-able halogenated starting materials, in many cases neces-sitating a unique synthetic path to explore each differentlyhalogenated analogue.9Not surprisingly, given the importance and paucity of ex-isting options for selective halogenation, several groupshave explored potential methods for this transformation.In 2010, the Hartwig group published a method for",

        "Yorkselective borylation of several nitrogen-containing hetero-cycles, primarily indoles.14 This borylation process pro-vides a functional handle for allylation, cross-coupling,and also chlorination and bromination. Halogenation,however, requires a three-step sequence of ruthenium-cat-alyzed silyation of the indole nitrogen, iridium-catalyzedborylation of the indole 7-position, and copper-catalyzedhalogenation. Although the 7-chlorination of indole wasaccomplished in this manner, this method illustrates thedifficulty of traditional chemocatalytic, site-selective ha-logenation. Five steps and three metals are required, andthe indole nitrogen is used as a directing group \u2013 indolesfunctionalized at the 1-position would not be compatiblewith this method. Furthermore, only the 7-position isfunctionalized by this method, and modifying this proce-dure to allow 6-, 5-, or 4-borylation would prove difficultor impossible. From this, we see that an optimal halogena-tion catalyst is not only site-selective, but also easily mod-ifiable in its site-selectivity. In addition, an optimalcatalyst is also efficient, scalable, environmentally be-nign, and tolerant of a wide range of substrates (and fur-thermore, modifiable in its substrate scope). Thesecharacteristics are hard to find together in a catalyst forany reaction, let alone halogenation.Thankfully, there already exist catalysts that fulfill manyof these criteria. Natural enzymes capable of oxidative ha-logenation have been discovered;15 among these, a sub-class of enzymes called FAD-dependent halogenases(FDHs) are able to perform regioselective arene halogena-tions.16 Their regioselectivity arises from the fact that theactive halogenating intermediate, a haloamine adductformed with an active site lysine residue, is proximal onlyto a single C\u2013H bond on the bound substrate.17 TheseFDHs utilize sodium chloride instead of chlorine gas as achlorine source, operate in water at room temperaturerather than in chlorinated solvents at high temperaturesand pressures, and use no heavy metals, which is especial-ly attractive in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, for whichthe removal of residual metals can be expensive and re-duce yield.18 Because these FDHs are genetically encodedcatalysts, they can be altered through the process of direct-ed evolution.19 In this process, mutations are introducedinto the genetic code, the resultant mutant enzymes arescreened for improved properties, and those that are im-proved are used as the starting point for another round ofmutation and selection. This process may be repeated asmany times as necessary to obtain a mutant with suffi-ciently improved properties. The enzymes themselves areinherently green and regioselective, while the process ofdirected evolution offers the facile modifiability of thesubstrate scope, regioselectivity, and other properties thatare necessary components of an ideal catalyst.Particularly notable are several tryptophan halogenases,which are capable of selectively halogenating the 5-, 6-, or7-position on the indole ring; of these, the tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA20 and RebH21 are the most studied(Scheme 1). This natural tryptophan 7-halogenation hasbeen exploited for the derivatization of drug molecules bythe Goss group, who integrated PrnA into the biosyntheticpathway for pacidamycin, a uridyl peptide antibiotic.22The resultant chloropacidamycin was further derivatizedby using cross-coupling chemistry to produce a range ofarylated pacidamycin analogues. However, the utility ofthis method is limited to derivatizing products that inte-grate L-tryptophan into their synthetic pathways, and theability to use halogenases on other substrates would sub-stantially increase the number of accessible compounds.The substrate scope of wild-type PrnA has been explored,and it was found to halogenate a range of substituted in-doles, including N-\u2126-methyltryptamine, 5-methyltrypt-amine, and 3-and 5-methylindole.23 With the exception ofthe native substrate L-tryptophan, however, the other in-dole substrates were all halogenated at the most electron-ically activated 2-position. In addition, several othersubstrates tested were not halogenated, including gra-mine, 1-methyltryptamine, and indole itself. Whereastryptophan itself is not the most interesting target for",

        "1345\u20131349logenation, the indole moiety is highly prevalent in phar-maceuticals, and regioselective halogenation of one ofthese tryptamines at an electronically deactivated positionwould have been a promising start for evolution towardsdrug scaffolds. The first piece of evidence that RebHmight be a useful alternative for regioselectivity camefrom the O\u2019Connor group. This group had previously in-tegrated RebH into the alkaloid-producing plant Mada-gascar periwinkle in order to produce halogenatedalkaloids, but they found a buildup of 7-chlorotryptophan,because tryptophan decarboxylase is a bottleneck for al-kaloid production.24 To avoid this bottleneck, the authorssought to halogenate tryptamine directly, rather than ex-ploit tryptophan halogenation followed by subsequent de-carboxylation.25 Several active site residues were mutatedto a range of different amino acids until a mutant wasfound that preferentially halogenated tryptamine overtryptophan. Characterization of the halogenated productshowed that tryptamine was selectively halogenated at the7-position, offering the first evidence of selective haloge-nation of an unnatural substrate at an electronically disfa-vored position.We then sought to explore the substrate scope of RebHeven further, both to reexamine the range of accepted sub-strates that were halogenated only at the 2-position byPrnA as well as those not accepted by PrnA, and to ex-plore new scaffolds in which we are interested. Because ofthe wide range of substrates we wished to test, and the pre-parative scale on which we wished to perform the reac-tions, it was first necessary to improve the expression ofRebH in E. coli. We focused on E. coli as a host becauseit is easily manipulated with high transformation efficien-cies, which greatly facilitates directed evolution. Throughcoexpression of RebH with the GroEL and GroES chaper-one proteins,26 more than 100mg of soluble enzyme wereisolated per liter of culture, which is more than a seven-fold improvement over the reported conditions.27 In addi-tion, RebF, the flavin reductase partner to RebH, was con-jugated to the maltose binding protein (MBP) solubilitytag.28 This MBP-RebF conjugate afforded more than elev-en-fold greater yields than those reported for RebF, andfortuitously retained full reductase activity without cleav-age of the MBP moiety. Using large quantities of both en-zymes obtained in this manner, along with a commerciallyavailable glucose dehydrogenase to complete the cofactorregeneration system,29 we began to explore the substratescope of wild-type RebH. In addition to the halogenationof L-tryptophan and tryptamine, both reported by O\u2019Con-nor, we found that RebH halogenated 5-methyltryptamineand N-\u2126-methyltryptamine as reported for PrnA. Further-more, RebH also halogenated gramine, 1-methyltrypt-amine, and indole, all of which PrnA was reported to notaccept, as well as D-tryptophan, tryptophol, 2-methyl-tryptamine, the tricyclic alkaloid tryptoline, and severalnaphthalenes, none of which had been tested as halogena-tion substrates for either RebH or PrnA. Most significant-ly, we performed 10mg scale bioconversions of eleven ofthese substrates, isolated and characterized the productsusing conventional chemical techniques (Figure 2), andfound that, unlike for PrnA, many of these substrates wereselectively halogenated at electronically disfavored posi-tions (Figure 3). In many of these cases, such as trypt-amine, tryptophol, and 2-methyltryptamine, only theproduct of 7-halogenation was observed, as seen for thenative substrate, L-tryptophan. For 5-methyltryptamine,however, only 6-halogenation was observed, whereas amix of 5-and 6-chlorinated products of tryptoline wereisolated. We think that these alternative selectivities willoffer useful synthetic starting points and provide insightsinto ways to alter the selectivity of RebH through directedevolution. Prior to our work on the expression enhancement of RebHin E. coli, studies on protein engineering, and especiallydirected evolution, of halogenases were greatly hinderedby low yields of soluble enzyme. To alter the behavior ofRebH with unnatural substrates, the O\u2019Connor group in-troduced a mutation to cause RebH to preferentially halo-genate tryptamine, as described above. To change theregioselectivity of PrnA, the vanP\u00e9e group changed a res-idue to one present in PyrH, a tryptophan 5-halogenase,and observed a mix of 7-and 5-halogenation in an approx-imately 2:1 ratio.30 Despite the fact that FDHs had beenknown for over a decade, these two studies representedthe limit of protein engineering to alter substrate scope orregioselectivity of FDHs, and no directed evolution hadbeen reported. Following our expression enhancement,we were able to obtain sufficient quantities of solubleRebH to perform the preparative-scale bioconversions de-scribed above, as well as a 100mg bioconversion of L-tryptophan by using the crude lysate from E. coli express-ing RebH to demonstrate the preparative utility of the",

        "Yorkzyme without purification. Another effect of thisexpression enhancement was that reasonable levels ofconversion of L-tryptophan could be observed when thelysate from only 1 mL of culture was used. During direct-ed evolution, 96-well plates, in which each well contained1 mL of culture of a different mutant, were used for high-throughput protein expression and screening. Our expres-sion enhancement thus allowed us to begin the directedevolution of RebH.It has been shown that the thermostability of an enzymetends to promote its evolvability;31 random mutations in-troduced into an enzyme tend to be destabilizing, so themore stable the enzyme is initially, the higher the muta-tional load it can tolerate. As only single mutations hadbeen introduced to RebH in the past, we were unsure ofthe mutational load that RebH would tolerate and there-fore the extent to which mutations could be introduced toimprove various catalytic parameters of this enzyme. Ourgroup thus set out to improve the stability of RebH. By us-ing error-prone PCR, libraries of RebH mutants were gen-erated, which were expressed in 96-well culture plates andscreened (by high-throughput HPLC) for improved activ-ity after heat pre-treatment. By using this method, a mu-tant was found after three rounds of evolution with amelting temperature (measured by circular dichroism)nearly 18\u00b0C higher than wild-type RebH32 (Figure 4). Itwas further found that several thermostabilized mutantsgave higher conversions on several unnatural substrates atelevated temperatures, in several cases giving higher con-versions than wild-type RebH does at its optimal temper-ature, apparently owing to the longer life of these mutants.The thermostabilized mutants developed through this pro-cess offer a potentially improved starting point for evolv-ing other properties of RebH.Halogenases offer an environmentally benign, site-selec-tive alternative to conventional chemocatalytic tech-niques, which suffer from a lack of site-selectivity andrequire harsh reaction conditions. Natural halogenases arehindered in their application in the laboratory by their lowactivity and narrow substrate scope, and attempts to makehalogenases more useful through directed evolution have,in turn, been hindered by the low expression of soluble en-zyme in E. coli. By using chaperone proteins, our grouphas successfully overcome the low expression of solubleRebH, a tryptophan 7-halogenase, and demonstrated thatRebH is capable of site-selective halogenation of a re-markably broad range of substrates. Our group has alsoaccomplished the first reported directed evolution ofRebH, improving its thermostability as a starting point forsubsequent evolution. Future efforts will focus on the gen-eration of mutants to accomplish site-selective halogena-tions of complex drug targets to improve the biologicalactivities of these compounds, such as those described inthe introduction. Evolved halogenases will hopefully soonenable a biological exploration of many potentially inter-esting drug targets that would otherwise have been over-looked due to the difficulty of their",
