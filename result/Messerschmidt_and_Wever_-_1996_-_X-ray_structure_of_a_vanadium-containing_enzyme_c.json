C. Slater Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Amsterdam, 1018 TV Amsterdam, The Netherlands Communicated by Robert Huber, Max-Planck-Institut fuir Biochemie, Martinsried, Germany, August 7, 1995 (received for review June 3, 1995) ABSTRACT The chloroperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.-) from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis belongs to a class of vanadium enzymes that oxidize halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to the corresponding hypohalous acids. The 2.1 A crystal structure (R = 20%) of an azide chloroperoxidase complex reveals the geometry of the catalytic vanadium center. Azide coordinates directly to the metal center, result-ing in a structure with azide, three nonprotein oxygens, and a histidine as ligands. In the native state vanadium will be bound as hydrogen vanadate(V) in a trigonal bipyramidal coordination with the metal coordinated to three oxygens in the equatorial plane, to the OH group at one apical position, and to the e2 nitrogen of a histidine at the other apical position. The protein fold is mainly a-helical with two four-helix bundles as main structural motifs and an overall struc-ture different from other structures. The helices pack together to a compact molecule, which explains the high stability of the protein. An amino acid sequence comparison with vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase from the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum shows high similarities in the regions of the metal binding site, with all hydrogen vanadate(V) interacting resi-dues conserved except for lysine-353, which is an asparagine. Haloperoxidases form a class of enzymes that are able to oxidize halides (Cl-, Br-, I-) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to the corresponding hypohalous acids according to H202 + X + H+ ->H20 + HOX. If a convenient nucleophilic acceptor is present, a reaction will occur with HOX to form a diversity of halogenated reaction products. Many of these organohalogens have biocidal effects and thus may provide defense functions. As has only been recently discovered (1, 2), some of the haloperoxidases contain vanadium in the active site. These enzymes are widespread in the marine environment and have been found in a variety of seaweeds (3). Recently, it was shown (4) that the chloroperoxidase (CPO) secreted by the fungus Curvularia inaequalis is also a vanadium enzyme with properties similar to the bromoperoxidase. This CPO forms HOCl as a product (5), which is a strongly bactericidal and oxidizing agent. The fungus belongs to the group of dematiaceous hyphomycetes, which are pathogenic toward plants and/or are saprophytes, and it has been sug-gested (6) that the enzyme and its product are used in a mechanism to oxidize plant cell walls to facilitate penetration of the fungus into the host. The vanadium bromoperoxidases have been studied in great detail using a variety of biophysical techniques (7) including extended x-ray absorption fine structure (8, 9) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (10, 11).

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determi-nation. Hanging droplets were made from 7.5 ,ul of a protein solution (8.7 mg/ml) in 5 mM Mops (pH 8.1) and 1 mM Na3VO4 and 2.5 ,ul of precipitating buffer containing 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl plus 0.02% NaN3 (pH 8.0). Crystallization was achieved at 21\u00b0C by vapor diffusion against 1.6 M (NH4)2SO4 in 0.1 M Tris HCl plus 0.02% NaN3 (pH 8.0). Rhombohedral-shaped crystals of -0.3 mm appeared after 3 days. They were harvested in 2.0 M (NH4)2S04/0.1 M Tris-HCl/0.02% NaN3 (pH 8.0) for data collection of the native form (see Table 1). The crystals diffracted to 2.1 A resolution and belonged to the space group R3 with lattice constants a = b = 131.69 A, c = 112.97 A, a = 1 = 90', y = 1200. All x-ray measurements were done on a Hendrix/Lentfer x-ray image-plate system (Mar-Research, Hamburg, Germany) mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode generator operated at 5.4 kW (A = CuKa = 1.5418 A) and at 16\u00b0C. The x-ray intensities were processed with MOSFLM (16) and programs from the CCP4 suite (17). Heavy atom derivatives were prepared as described in Table 1 and were analyzed by difference Patterson methods and cross-phased difference Fourier maps with PROTEIN (18). Heavy atom sites and phases were refined with MLPHARE (19k. Phases were improved and extended from 3.5 A to 2.5A resolution by the density modification routines of the CCP4 suite (17). Skeletonized electron density maps (20) were used to identify the molecular envelope and to locate secondary struc-ture. The program o (21) was used on an ESV-30 Graphic system workstation (Evans & Sutherland, Salt Lake City) for all model building. The model was refined by energy-restrained crystallo-graphic refinement with XPLOR (22), and the parameters were derived by Engh and Huber (23). Equilibrium bond distances and bond angles for the vanadium site were taken from hydrogen vanadate (24) and from a vanadium(V) complex containing bound azide (25). Weak restraints (1/10th of corresponding parameters) were applied to the metal site. The current model has been refined to a crystallographicR factor of 20.0% with all data from 8.0 to 2.1 A resolution (41,486 unique reflections) and comprises 4485 nohydrogen protein atoms, 429 water oxygen Biochemistry: Messerschmidt and Wever D ow nl oa de d fr om  http s: //w w w .p na s. or g by  Uni ve rs ity  of Il lin oi s on  Jun e 1,  202 2 fr om  IP ad dr es s 12 8. 17 4. 12 4. 13 0. 394 Biochemistry: Messerschmidt and Wever 'AR W)( AR(; 113;,8,)() 1*R,)ty~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~110 FIG. 3.

Residues 1-2 and 579-609 are not contained in the model because they are not defined by electron density and are probably mobile or disor-dered. The occupancies of residues 118-127 were set to zero as their initial electron density did not refine to a clear appearance for this extemal loop. The averageB factors for main chain atoms, side chain atoms, and solvent molecules are 20.4, 22.1, and 40.3 A2, respectively.t An x-ray data set of a crystal grown with azide-free buffer was collected to a resolution of 2.0A on the same experimental setup and processed as described before. Model coordinates omitting the V03 and azide groups were refined against the FO values of the azide-free form, and a corresponding IFol -IFcI difference Fourier map was calculated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overall Protein Structure. The structure solved by multiple isomorphous replacement techniques (Table 1) reveals one molecule per asymmetric unit. The molecule has an overall cylindrical shape with a length of about 80 A and a diameter of 55 A (Fig. 1A). The molecules are arranged in the crystals as trimers around the crystallographic threefold axis. The secondary structure, which was analyzed with the program DSSP (27), is mainly helical (about 44% of the atomic model), consisting of 20 helices, a small part of {3-structures (six short 13-strands, pairwise arranged as three antiparallel 13-ladders), tThe atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Chemistry Department, Brookhaven Na-tional Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973 (identification code 1V NC).

Two four-helix bundles (a-helices B, C, E, and F and a-helices K, L, N, and 0) are the main structural motifs of the tertiary structure and are spatially related by a rotation of about 1800 around an axis perpendicular to the sketch plane in Fig. 2. These helices are between 14 and 31 residues long. a-Helices G and S are each packed against one of the four-helix bundles, and a-helices I and J are located on top of the four-helix bundles and approximately perpendicular to their helical axes. There are eight short helices found in connecting segments. Four of them are a-helical (H, M, P, and Q in Figs. 1B and 2), and the other four are 310-helices (A, D, R, and T in Figs. 1B and 2). At a first glance, the compact a-helical structure of CPO resembles those of the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli (28) and the first domain of the a subunit and the 13 subunit of the hydroxylase protein of methane monooxygenase from Meth-ylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (29), both nonheme di-iron pro-teins. However, the main motif in both nonheme di-iron proteins is an eight-helix bundle with a special topological sequence and arrangement of the a-helices different from that found here. Recently, the crystal structure of a bacterial bromoperoxidase (30) has been determined. This enzyme lacks cofactors and shows the general topology of the a/13 hydrolase fold. Apparently, the vanadium CPO and the bac-terial bromoperoxidase lack any structural similarities and are very different enzymes. Vanadium Binding Site. The vanadium center is located on top of the second four-helix bundle (Fig. 1A), and the residues forming the metal binding site are coming from helices J, L, N, and 0 and from turns 290-294, 355-363, 395-406, and 492-502 (Fig. 3). Thus, all residues building up the metal center are from the C-terminal half of the molecule. In our structure with a 2 mM azide mother liquor concentration, the vanadium has a trigonal bipyramidal coordination with three nonprotein FIG. 4.

A stereoview of the atomic model and the 21F01 -IFcI electron density map around the vanadium center is shown in Fig. 4. It demonstrates the good quality of the electron density map and the clear definition of the azide group. The negative charge of the V03 group with vanadium in the oxidation state (V) is compensated by hydrogen bonds to several positively charged protein side chains and the main chain amide nitrogen of Gly-403 (Fig. 3). Oxygen Ow1 of the V03 group makes hydrogen bonds to nitrogens N71l of Arg-360 (2.94 A) and N q2 of Arg-490 (2.93 A), oxygen 0-2 to nitrogen NC of Lys-353 (2.72 A) and nitrogen N of Gly-403 (2.99 A), and oxygen o,0 to oxygen Oy of Ser-402 (2.71 A) and nitrogen N-of Arg-490 (3.04 A). A water molecule from solvent is hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen atom Ni of the bound azide molecule. Preliminary azide inhibition studies on CPO from C. inaequalis reveal that inhibition occurs at already very low concentrations (<1 ,uM) (P. Barnett and R.W., unpublished results). The binding of the vanadium as hydrogen vanadate(V) has now been confirmed by a difference Fourier map of the azide-free form, which was calculated as described before. This difference map contains as highest peaks the V04 group and one water molecule hydrogen bonded to the apical oxygen atom. The difference density has the shape of a trigonal pyramid with the vanadium in the center of the trigonal base plane, three oxygens at the vertices of this plane, and the fourth oxygen at the apex of the pyramid. The NC2 atom from His-496 completes the trigonal bipyramidal coordination of the vana-dium. Exact bond lengths and angles of the vanadium binding site of the azide-free form will be available after crystallo-graphic refinement of the azide-free form.

This channel supplies good access and release for the substrates and products of the enzymatic reaction. One con-tiguous half of its surface is mainly hydrophobic with Pro-47, Pro-211, Trp-350, Phe-393, Pro-395, Pro-396, and Phe-397 as contributing side chains. The other half is predominantly polar with several main chain carbonyl oxygens and the ion pair Arg-490-Asp-292. It is intriguing that the vanadium(V) is bound directly as hydrogen vanadate(V) with one immediate protein ligand only. Mechanistic Aspects. Steady-state kinetic studies on CPO (5) show that in the pH range between 6 and 7 the enzyme mechanism is a ping-pong type. The available structural data allow us to speculate about the catalytic mechanism on an atomic basis. It is very likely that the azide binding site is the binding site for the peroxide as well. It is directly accessible from the solvent channel, and azide is an inhibitor for CPO. The peroxide will probably be bound in an q2 side-on fashion as in many other vanadium peroxide complexes (7, 32). However an end-on binding mode as HO2 is also conceivable. The next step in the mechanism would then be the binding of the chloride ion to the activated peroxide. Three residues near the azide or peroxide binding site deserve special interest, the hydrophobic side chains of Trp-350 and Phe-397 as well as the imidazole ring of His-404 (Fig. 3). Both hydrophobic side chains provide a hydrophobic environment, which seems to be necessary to stabilize the chloride binding. This has been found in chloride binding sites of various amylases where one side chain close to the chloride ion is donated from a hydrophobic residue (33). Similarly, in the haloalkane dehalogenase of Xanthobacter autotrophilicus two tryptophan residues are present involved in halogen and halide binding (34). His-404 is on the other side of the chloride binding site and may play a crucial role as an acid-base group in catalysis. Steady-state kinetic data of the vanadium chloroperoxidase show (5) that binding of hydrogen peroxide is inhibited when a group with a pKa larger than 5 is protonated. It may be that when His-404 is protonated binding of peroxide to the metal site is no longer possible as is also seen in heme iron peroxi-dases. This suggests some analogy to the reaction of heme-containing cytochrome c peroxidase (35) with peroxide and the vanadium enzyme. Without proper knowledge of the true nature of the perox-ide or peroxo intermediate formed, it is difficult to predict the exact sequence of events occurring after the formation of the peroxo intermediate. Steady-state studies show that the Km for Cl-is dependent on pH, suggesting that the chloride binds only when a proton has been taken up by the activated peroxo complex. A nucleophilic attack of the chloride on the activated peroxide is probably the next step. This is similar to that proposed for the reaction between Br-and the adduct of hydrogen peroxide and methylrhenium trioxide (13), although CPO BRPO Consensus Function CPO BRPO Consensus Function CPO BRPO Consensus Function Biochemistry: Messerschmidt and Wever D ow nl oa de d fr om  http s: //w w w .p na s. or g by  Uni ve rs ity  of Il lin oi s on  Jun e 1,  202 2 fr om  IP ad dr es s 12 8. 17 4. 12 4. 13 0. 396 Biochemistry: Messerschmidt and Wever the possibility cannot be excluded that halide oxidation occurs by coordination to the metal (12). Whatever the exact mech-anism, a short-lived HOCG intermediate is formed by the enzyme, and it is likely that His-404 acts as proton donor. Thermostability. CPO exhibits a high thermostability and a high stability in organic solvents (5). The structural and genetic analysis of protein stability by Matthews and associates (36) demonstrated the main factors in stabilizing globular proteins. The effect of disulfide bridges need not to be considered here since they are absent in CPO. The major factor is the hydro-phobic effect followed by a minor contribution of electrostatic interactions. The intramolecular ion pairs of CPO were ana-lyzed to assess the electrostatic effect on stabilizing the CPO structure. CPO contains 42 intramolecular ion pairs, four of them with a surface accessibility area of 0.0 A2. In comparison, ascorbate oxidase, a copper protein of similar size (552 residues) and not thermostable, has 42 intramolecular ion pairs in which eight of them exhibit a surface accessibility area of 0.0 A2 (37). Thus, the electrostatic contribution is not responsible for the high stability of CPO, and we conclude that the high stability is mainly due to the compact packing of helices, which reveals a strong stabilizing hydrophobic effect. Sequence Comparison with Vanadium-Containing Bro-moperoxidase from Ascophyllum nodosum. An amino acid sequence alignment of the sequence of CPO with the recently determined partial sequence (236 residues) of the vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum (38) has been carried out, and the regions of high similarities are shown in Fig. 6. There are three stretches of high similarity in the regions of residues providing the vanadium histidine ligand (His-496), the vanadate-interacting residues (Arg-360, Ser-402, Gly-403, Arg-490), and the catalytic His-404. Lys-353 has been mutated to an asparagine, which can form a hydrogen bond to 0-2 as well. The alignment demonstrates that the metal binding sites in both vanadium-containing haloperoxidases and the overall protein fold will be very similar, reflecting the close relation-ship of both enzymes.

        "ABSTRACT The chloroperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.-) from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis belongs to a class of vanadium enzymes that oxidize halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to the corresponding hypohalous acids. The 2.1 A crystal structure (R = 20%) of an azide chloroperoxidase complex reveals the geometry of the catalytic vanadium center. Azide coordinates directly to the metal center, result-ing in a structure with azide, three nonprotein oxygens, and a histidine as ligands. In the native state vanadium will be bound as hydrogen vanadate(V) in a trigonal bipyramidal coordination with the metal coordinated to three oxygens in the equatorial plane, to the OH group at one apical position, and to the e2 nitrogen of a histidine at the other apical position. The protein fold is mainly a-helical with two four-helix bundles as main structural motifs and an overall struc-ture different from other structures. The helices pack together to a compact molecule, which explains the high stability of the protein. An amino acid sequence comparison with vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase from the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum shows high similarities in the regions of the metal binding site, with all hydrogen vanadate(V) interacting resi-dues conserved except for lysine-353, which is an asparagine.",

        "If a convenient nucleophilic acceptor is present, a reaction will occur with HOX to form a diversity of halogenated reaction products. Many of these organohalogens have biocidal effects and thus may provide defense functions. As has only been recently discovered (1, 2), some of the haloperoxidases contain vanadium in the active site. These enzymes are widespread in the marine environment and have been found in a variety of seaweeds (3). Recently, it was shown (4) that the chloroperoxidase (CPO) secreted by the fungus Curvularia inaequalis is also a vanadium enzyme with properties similar to the bromoperoxidase. This CPO forms HOCl as a product (5), which is a strongly bactericidal and oxidizing agent. The fungus belongs to the group of dematiaceous hyphomycetes, which are pathogenic toward plants and/or are saprophytes, and it has been sug-gested (6) that the enzyme and its product are used in a mechanism to oxidize plant cell walls to facilitate penetration of the fungus into the host. The vanadium bromoperoxidases have been studied in great detail using a variety of biophysical techniques (7) including extended x-ray absorption fine structure (8, 9) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (10, 11).

Hanging droplets were made from 7.5 ,ul of a protein solution (8.7 mg/ml) in 5 mM Mops (pH 8.1) and 1 mM Na3VO4 and 2.5 ,ul of precipitating buffer containing 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl plus 0.02% NaN3 (pH 8.0). Crystallization was achieved at 21\u00b0C by vapor diffusion against 1.6 M (NH4)2SO4 in 0.1 M Tris HCl plus 0.02% NaN3 (pH 8.0). Rhombohedral-shaped crystals of -0.3 mm appeared after 3 days. They were harvested in 2.0 M (NH4)2S04/0.1 M Tris-HCl/0.02% NaN3 (pH 8.0) for data collection of the native form (see Table 1). The crystals diffracted to 2.1 A resolution and belonged to the space group R3 with lattice constants a = b = 131.69 A, c = 112.97 A, a = 1 = 90', y = 1200. All x-ray measurements were done on a Hendrix/Lentfer x-ray image-plate system (Mar-Research, Hamburg, Germany) mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode generator operated at 5.4 kW (A = CuKa = 1.5418 A) and at 16\u00b0C. The x-ray intensities were processed with MOSFLM (16) and programs from the CCP4 suite (17). Heavy atom derivatives were prepared as described in Table 1 and were analyzed by difference Patterson methods and cross-phased difference Fourier maps with PROTEIN (18). Heavy atom sites and phases were refined with MLPHARE (19k. Phases were improved and extended from 3.5 A to 2.5A resolution by the density modification routines of the CCP4 suite (17). Skeletonized electron density maps (20) were used to identify the molecular envelope and to locate secondary struc-ture. The program o (21) was used on an ESV-30 Graphic system workstation (Evans & Sutherland, Salt Lake City) for all model building. The model was refined by energy-restrained crystallo-graphic refinement with XPLOR (22), and the parameters were derived by Engh and Huber (23). Equilibrium bond distances and bond angles for the vanadium site were taken from hydrogen vanadate (24) and from a vanadium(V) complex containing bound azide (25). Weak restraints (1/10th of corresponding parameters) were applied to the metal site. The current model has been refined to a crystallographicR factor of 20.0% with all data from 8.0 to 2.1 A resolution (41,486 unique reflections) and comprises 4485 nohydrogen protein atoms, 429 water oxygen",

The molecule has an overall cylindrical shape with a length of about 80 A and a diameter of 55 A (Fig. 1A). The molecules are arranged in the crystals as trimers around the crystallographic threefold axis. The secondary structure, which was analyzed with the program DSSP (27), is mainly helical (about 44% of the atomic model), consisting of 20 helices, a small part of {3-structures (six short 13-strands, pairwise arranged as three antiparallel 13-ladders),",

        "and the rest of extended strand and loop regions (Figs. 1B and 2). Two four-helix bundles (a-helices B, C, E, and F and a-helices K, L, N, and 0) are the main structural motifs of the tertiary structure and are spatially related by a rotation of about 1800 around an axis perpendicular to the sketch plane in Fig. 2. These helices are between 14 and 31 residues long. a-Helices G and S are each packed against one of the four-helix bundles, and a-helices I and J are located on top of the four-helix bundles and approximately perpendicular to their helical axes. There are eight short helices found in connecting segments. Four of them are a-helical (H, M, P, and Q in Figs. 1B and 2), and the other four are 310-helices (A, D, R, and T in Figs. 1B and 2). At a first glance, the compact a-helical structure of CPO resembles those of the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli (28) and the first domain of the a subunit and the 13 subunit of the hydroxylase protein of methane monooxygenase from Meth-ylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (29), both nonheme di-iron pro-teins. However, the main motif in both nonheme di-iron proteins is an eight-helix bundle with a special topological sequence and arrangement of the a-helices different from that found here. Recently, the crystal structure of a bacterial bromoperoxidase (30) has been determined. This enzyme lacks cofactors and shows the general topology of the a/13 hydrolase fold. Apparently, the vanadium CPO and the bac-terial bromoperoxidase lack any structural similarities and are very different enzymes.",
        "Vanadium Binding Site. The vanadium center is located on top of the second four-helix bundle (Fig. 1A), and the residues forming the metal binding site are coming from helices J, L, N, and 0 and from turns 290-294, 355-363, 395-406, and 492-502 (Fig. 3).

The figure has been made by program MAIN (31). oxygen ligands (bond distances of about 1.65 A), one nitrogen ligand (Ne2 atom) from His-496 (bond distance of 2.25 A), and an exogenous azide ligand (bond distance to coordinating nitrogen of 1.98 A). A stereoview of the atomic model and the 21F01 -IFcI electron density map around the vanadium center is shown in Fig. 4. It demonstrates the good quality of the electron density map and the clear definition of the azide group. The negative charge of the V03 group with vanadium in the oxidation state (V) is compensated by hydrogen bonds to several positively charged protein side chains and the main chain amide nitrogen of Gly-403 (Fig. 3). Oxygen Ow1 of the V03 group makes hydrogen bonds to nitrogens N71l of Arg-360 (2.94 A) and N q2 of Arg-490 (2.93 A), oxygen 0-2 to nitrogen NC of Lys-353 (2.72 A) and nitrogen N of Gly-403 (2.99 A), and oxygen o,0 to oxygen Oy of Ser-402 (2.71 A) and nitrogen N-of Arg-490 (3.04 A). A water molecule from solvent is hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen atom Ni of the bound azide molecule. Preliminary azide inhibition studies on CPO from C. inaequalis reveal that inhibition occurs at already very low concentrations (<1 ,uM) (P. Barnett and R.W., unpublished results). The binding of the vanadium as hydrogen vanadate(V) has now been confirmed by a difference Fourier map of the azide-free form, which was calculated as described before. This difference map contains as highest peaks the V04 group and one water molecule hydrogen bonded to the apical oxygen atom. The difference density has the shape of a trigonal pyramid with the vanadium in the center of the trigonal base plane, three oxygens at the vertices of this plane, and the fourth oxygen at the apex of the pyramid. The NC2 atom from His-496 completes the trigonal bipyramidal coordination of the vana-dium. Exact bond lengths and angles of the vanadium binding site of the azide-free form will be available after crystallo-graphic refinement of the azide-free form. As Fig. 4 shows, the",

This channel supplies good access and release for the substrates and products of the enzymatic reaction. One con-tiguous half of its surface is mainly hydrophobic with Pro-47, Pro-211, Trp-350, Phe-393, Pro-395, Pro-396, and Phe-397 as contributing side chains. The other half is predominantly polar with several main chain carbonyl oxygens and the ion pair Arg-490-Asp-292. It is intriguing that the vanadium(V) is bound directly as hydrogen vanadate(V) with one immediate protein ligand only.",
        "Mechanistic Aspects. Steady-state kinetic studies on CPO (5) show that in the pH range between 6 and 7 the enzyme mechanism is a ping-pong type. The available structural data allow us to speculate about the catalytic mechanism on an atomic basis. It is very likely that the azide binding site is the binding site for the peroxide as well. It is directly accessible from the solvent channel, and azide is an inhibitor for CPO. The peroxide will probably be bound in an q2 side-on fashion as in many other vanadium peroxide complexes (7, 32). However an end-on binding mode as HO2 is also conceivable. The next step in the mechanism would then be the binding of the chloride ion to the activated peroxide. Three residues near the azide or peroxide binding site deserve special interest, the hydrophobic side chains of Trp-350 and Phe-397 as well as the imidazole ring of His-404 (Fig. 3). Both hydrophobic side chains provide a hydrophobic environment, which seems to be necessary to stabilize the chloride binding. This has been found in chloride binding sites of various amylases where one side chain close to the chloride ion is donated from a hydrophobic residue (33). Similarly, in the haloalkane dehalogenase of Xanthobacter autotrophilicus two tryptophan residues are present involved in halogen and halide binding (34).",
        "His-404 is on the other side of the chloride binding site and may play a crucial role as an acid-base group in catalysis. Steady-state kinetic data of the vanadium chloroperoxidase show (5) that binding of hydrogen peroxide is inhibited when a group with a pKa larger than 5 is protonated. It may be that when His-404 is protonated binding of peroxide to the metal site is no longer possible as is also seen in heme iron peroxi-dases. This suggests some analogy to the reaction of heme-containing cytochrome c peroxidase (35) with peroxide and the vanadium enzyme.",
        "Without proper knowledge of the true nature of the perox-ide or peroxo intermediate formed, it is difficult to predict the exact sequence of events occurring after the formation of the peroxo intermediate. Steady-state studies show that the Km for Cl-is dependent on pH, suggesting that the chloride binds only when a proton has been taken up by the activated peroxo complex. A nucleophilic attack of the chloride on the activated peroxide is probably the next step. This is similar to that proposed for the reaction between Br-and the adduct of hydrogen peroxide and methylrhenium trioxide (13), although",

        "the possibility cannot be excluded that halide oxidation occurs by coordination to the metal (12). Whatever the exact mech-anism, a short-lived HOCG intermediate is formed by the enzyme, and it is likely that His-404 acts as proton donor. Thermostability. CPO exhibits a high thermostability and a high stability in organic solvents (5). The structural and genetic analysis of protein stability by Matthews and associates (36) demonstrated the main factors in stabilizing globular proteins. The effect of disulfide bridges need not to be considered here since they are absent in CPO. The major factor is the hydro-phobic effect followed by a minor contribution of electrostatic interactions. The intramolecular ion pairs of CPO were ana-lyzed to assess the electrostatic effect on stabilizing the CPO structure. CPO contains 42 intramolecular ion pairs, four of them with a surface accessibility area of 0.0 A2. In comparison, ascorbate oxidase, a copper protein of similar size (552 residues) and not thermostable, has 42 intramolecular ion pairs in which eight of them exhibit a surface accessibility area of 0.0 A2 (37). Thus, the electrostatic contribution is not responsible for the high stability of CPO, and we conclude that the high stability is mainly due to the compact packing of helices, which reveals a strong stabilizing hydrophobic effect. Sequence Comparison with Vanadium-Containing Bro-moperoxidase from Ascophyllum nodosum. An amino acid sequence alignment of the sequence of CPO with the recently determined partial sequence (236 residues) of the vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum (38) has been carried out, and the regions of high similarities are shown in Fig. 6. There are three stretches of high similarity in the regions of residues providing the vanadium histidine ligand (His-496), the vanadate-interacting residues (Arg-360, Ser-402, Gly-403, Arg-490), and the catalytic His-404. Lys-353 has been mutated to an asparagine, which can form a hydrogen bond to 0-2 as well. The alignment demonstrates that the metal binding sites in both vanadium-containing haloperoxidases and the overall protein fold will be very similar, reflecting the close relation-ship of both enzymes.
