Introduction The use of microbial enzymes for the transformation of organic compounds has been employed as a powerful method in metabolism studies and in modern synthetic organic chemistry for decades (Smith and Rosazza, 1975; Faber, 1992). One of the enzymatic reactions that has been widely studied is a chloroperoxidase-catalyzed halogenation (Franssen, 1994). Chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago (CPO; EC 1.11.1.10) is a well-known enzyme, capable of halogenating a great variety of organic compounds such as b-ketoacids (Shaw and Hager, 1959), cyclic b-diketones (Hager et al., 1966), ster-oids (Levine et al., 1968), alkenes (Yamada et al., 1985), activated aromatic compounds (Wannstedt et al., 1990), and heterocylcic compounds (Franssen et al., 1987). The reaction mechanism of CPO involves the formation of a halogenium ion (X+) or hypohalous acid (HOX) as an intermediate which can effect electrophilic substitution with electron-rich substrates (Yamada et al., 1985; Libby et al., 1992). The enzymatic halogenation of several flavanones and flavones having electron-donating groups was investi-gated in this study. Flavonoids are very common as secondary metabolites found in nature with a great variety of structural forms and biological activities (Harborne, 1988). The vast literature related to flavo-noid biotransformations is primarily concerned with oxidation, methylation and glucosidation (Ibrahim and Abul-Hajj, 1990a,b; Ibrahim et al., 1997). One study was found on the microbial chlorination of the iso-flavone genistein by Streptomyces griseus and S. plicatus (Anyanwutaku et al., 1992). There are no previous reports on the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed halogenation of flavonoid compounds. Therefore, we examined the use of whole cells and CPO of C. fumago to brominate and chlorinate various flavanones and flavones. The enzy-matic study was also compared with chemical halogena-tion using molecular halogen and hypohalous acid. 2. Results and discussion The enzymatic bromination and chlorination of fla-vanones and flavones using C. fumago whole cells and CPO gave the results shown in Table 1.With BrNone and ClNone present as halides, both C. fumago and CPO catalyzed the halogenation of the flavanones, naringenin and hesper-etin, but were inactive toward the test flavones. The metabolic products were isolated and identified on the basis of NMR and mass spectral analyses. Mass spectra of halogenated compounds showed typical character-istics of isotope peak, suggesting a number of halogen atoms present in each metabolite. 0031-9422/01/$ -see front matter # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The biobrominations of naringenin and hesperetin gave 6,8-dibromonaringenin (1), 8-bromonaringenin (2), 6,8-dibromohesperetin (5), and 8-bromohesperetin (6), respectively. The mass spectral analysis indicated the presence of two bromine atoms in 1 and 5 and one bromine atom in 2 and 6. The 1H NMR spectra of bro-minated compounds were similar to those of naringenin and hesperetin, except for the disappearance of two proton signals in 1 and 5 and one proton signal in 2 and 6 at the H-6 and/or H-8 regions (Tables 2 and 3). These data clearly supported that 1 and 5 were dibrominated products having two bromine atoms at positions 6 and 8. The position of the bromine atoms in 2 and 6 were identified by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra. Relative to naringenin and hesperetin, the 13C NMR spectra of 2 and 6 showed a new quaternary carbon signal around 88 ppm, while one of the two methine carbon peaks in the 96 ppm region disappeared (Table 4). This suggested that the bromine atom might be at either C-6 or C-8. HMBC data of 2 showed that the hydroxyl proton at 12.15 ppm (OH-5) had long range couplings to the methine carbon at 96.30 ppm, and two quaternary car-bons at 102.97 and 162.97 ppm corresponding to C-6, C-4a, and C-5, respectively. The methine proton at 6.14 ppm (H-6) showed long range couplings with signals at 88.41 (C-8), 102.97 (C-4a), and 162.97 (C-5 and C-7) ppm. In addition, compounds 2 and 6 gave similar 13C NMR spectral patterns and the carbon signals at C-7 and C-8a of 2 and 6 were shifted upfield by 4.5 ppm compared to those of naringenin and hesperetin. These results indicated that the bromine atom in 2 and 6 must be at C-8. The enzymatic chlorinations of naringenin and hesper-etin also gave four metabolic products, 6,8-dichloronar-ingenin (3), 6-chloronaringenin (4), 6,8-dichlorohesperetin (7) and 6-chlorohesperetin (8). The mass and 1H NMR spectral analyses of 3 and 7 established the presence of two chlorine atoms at positions 6 and 8. The mass and 1H NMR spectra of 4 and 8 indicated one chlorine atom at either position 6 or 8 (Tables 2 and 3).

Yaipakdee, L.W. Robertson / Phytochemistry 57 (2001) 341\u2013347 spectra of 4 and 8 showed a quaternary carbon and a methine carbon signals in the C-6 and C-8 regions at lower field compared to those of their precursors (Table 4). The structural assignment of 4 as 6-chlor-onaringenin was supported by a COLOC experiment. The hydroxy proton at None 12.74 (OH-5) had long range couplings to the quaternary signals at 101.02, 103.52, and 160.33 ppm thus corresponding to C-6, C-4a, and C-5, respectively. Since the 13C NMR spectral pattern of 8 was similar to that of 4, the chlorine atom in 8 was placed at C-6. This was supported by the appearance of carbon signals at C-5 and C-7 of 4 and 8 at higher field by about 5 ppm compared to those of naringenin and hesperetin. It was noted that, when the CPO enzyme was employed to halogenate naringenin and hesperetin, brominated products were obtained in better yields than chlorinated ones (Table 1). This was explainable since the halogenation of CPO is electrophilic and the reactiv-ity of halogenium ions increases in the following order: Cl+, Br+ and I+(Yamada et al., 1985). However, whenC. fumago whole cells were used, yields of chlorinated meta-bolites were higher. This might be due to the weak growth of C. fumago in the medium containing KBr. Overall, the halogenated products were obtained in low yields toge-ther with starting material. The halogenation of the substrates may proceed in competition with the halo-genation of CPO itself at tyrosine residues until the enzyme is no longer active (Wannstedt et al., 1990). Furthermore, since the enzymatic reactions were carried out in suspension, the uptake of the substrates for bio-transformation may be poor.

P. Yaipakdee, L.W. Robertson / Phytochemistry 57 (2001) 341\u2013347 343 The flavone-type compounds, flavone, flavonol, 7-hydroxyflavone, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone, quercetin, and 6-chloroflavone, were not suitable as substrates of CPO. The aromatic rings of these compounds possessing a strongly conjugated system were quite stable, and were thus inert to the enzymatic reaction. The relevant flava-nones were reactive since the conjugation in the flavanone system was disrupted by removing the 2,3-double bond. The biomimetic reactions of naringenin and hesperetin with chemical halogenating agents were examined. Their reaction products were identical to those obtained from the enzymatic reactions. The halogenations of nar-ingenin and hesperetin are electrophilic and occurred at the C-6 and C-8 positions on the A-rings. With the two hydroxy groups at C-5 and C-7, the A-rings of naringenin and hesperetin are considerably more nucleophilic and hence reactive towards electrophilic halogenating species than their B-rings. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedures 1H NMR spectra were recorded on an IBM AF-270 and a JNM-A500 spectrometer. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on an IBM AF-270 at 67.9 MHz, a JNM-A500 and a Bruker AM-500 at 125 MHz. (CD3)2CO was used as solvent. MS was performed using a VG 70 250S mass spectrometer and HP 5989B MS engine at 70 eV. FTIR spectra were obtained using a Magna-IRTM spectro-meter 750, using KBr plates. Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin Elmer 241 photoelectric polari-meter. Chemicals, all test samples, flavone, flavonol, 7-hydroxyflavone, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone, quercetin, 6-chloroflavone, naringenin, and hesperetin, were obtained from Sigma. Bromine and CPO were also purchased from Sigma. Sodium hypochlorite was obtained from Carlo. Other chemicals used were reagent grade. 3.2. Micro-organism Caldariomyces fumago ATCC 11925 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Live cul-tures were maintained by subculturing on suitable slants at room temperature or storage at 4NoneC in tightly capped culture tubes. 3.3. Enzymatic halogenation of flavanones and flavones by C. fumago whole cells A two-stage fermentation technique was employed. Stage I and stage II cultures were prepared by the fol-lowing method. The surface growth from C. fumago slants on mycophil agar (BBL) was suspended in 5 ml volumes of normal saline solution. One milliliter of the suspension was transferred into 100 ml of stage I med-ium in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks. The stage I cultures were incubated at ambient temperature (20NoneC) on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm for 48\u201372 h. Approximately 10 ml volumes of the actively growing stage I cultures were transferred to 100 ml of fresh medium in 500 ml erlen-meyer flasks. All fermentation experiments were carried out in a Czapek-yeast-KCl or Czapek-yeast-KBr med-ium, consisting of glucose, 30 g; NaNO3, 3.0 g; K2SO4, 1.0 g; MgSO4, 0.5 g; KCl or KBr, 0.5 g; (Fe)2(SO4)3, 0.01 g; yeast extract, 3.3 g in 1 l H2O. Media were ster-ilized by autoclaving at 121NoneC, 15 lb/in2 for 15 min. For initial screening experiments, 10 mg of each sam-ple as a solution in DMF (50 mg/ml) was added and suspended into each flask of 24 h stage II cultures. The culture was further incubated and monitored. Ten mil-liliters of the cultures were sampled daily and extracted 344 P. Yaipakdee, L.W. Robertson / Phytochemistry 57 (2001) 341\u2013347 with 10 ml of CHCl3, twice. The extracts were con-centrated to dryness and redissolved in 0.25 ml of 95% EtOH. The solutions were subjected to silica gel TLC and developed with toluene-Me2CO (10:1) and/or CH3Cl-MeOH (40:1). TLC plates exposed to UV light and Fast Blue BB spray reagent were analyzed. Control cultures of organism without substrate and controls consisting of substrate in medium without organism were performed along with sample cultures. Preparative scale fermentations were conducted on 150\u2013190 mg of substrates, using a two-stage shaken cul-ture fermentation as described above. The stage II cul-tures with substrate were incubated for 24\u201348 h before being harvested. The whole culture broths were exhaus-tively extracted twice with an equal volume of CHCl3. The CHCl3 extracts were dried over Na2SO4, evapo-rated and purified. 3.4. Enzymatic halogenation of flavanones and flavones by CPO (Sigma) The reaction conditions were modified from the method described by Yamada et al. (1985). For initial screening, the enzymatic reaction mixture contained 10 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2.75), 100 mmol of KBr or KCl, 25\u201350 units of CPO, and 20 mmol of a sub-strate. All substrates were insoluble in water, and had to be first dissolved in 70 ml of warm EtOH, then poured and suspended in the reaction mixture. The reaction was initiated by slowly adding 100 mmol of H2O2 and con-tinued for 60 min at room temperature with constant stirring. The control test was performed without the enzyme. The reaction was monitored by TLC as above. Preparative scale halogenation was conducted on 0.8 mmol of substrates. Each substrate was dissolved in 3 ml of warm EtOH, then poured into the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture consisted of 400 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2.75), 4 mmol of KBr or KCl, and 1000 units of CPO. H2O2 (4 mmol) was then slowly added. After 60 min, the reaction mixture was extracted with CHCl3 (200 mlNone3). The extracts were concentrated to dryness and followed by a series of chromatographic methods for the isolation of the halo-genated products. 3.5. Isolation procedures 3.5.1. Halogenated products 1\u20134 of naringenin formed by C. fumago whole cells From the microbial bromination of naringenin (180 mg) with C. fumago in Czapek-yeast-KBr, the dried CHCl3 extract was subjected to silica gel PF254 chroma-tography using toluene\u2013Me2CO (10:1) as eluant. Nar-ingenin (58 mg) was recovered. Flavonoid-containing fractions (18 mg) were subjected to prep. TLC using a silica gel 60 F254 plate at 0.25 mm thickness. The chroma-togram was developed three times, using toluene\u2013Me2CO (10:1) for the first development, then, CHCl3\u2013MeOH (40:1) for the last two. The plate was visualized under UV light at 254 nm. Two major bands were observed. The compound from each band was extracted from silica gel using Me2CO. 6,8-Dibromonaringenin (1) (4.3 mg) and 8-bromonaringenin (2) (3.2 mg) were isolated. The microbial chlorination of naringenin (190 mg) was performed with C. fumago in Czapek-yeast-KCl. The dried CHCl3 extract was applied to a silica gel PF254 col-umn with toluene\u2013Me2CO (12:1) giving 6,8-dichloronar-ingenin (3) (40 mg) and 6-chloronaringenin (4) (14.5 mg). 3.5.2. Halogenated products 1\u20134 of naringenin formed by CPO (Sigma) Each preparative scale bromination and chlorination was conducted on 217 mg of naringenin according to the method described above. The dried extract of each reac-tion mixture was subjected to silica gel 60 GF254 column chromatography with toluene\u2013Me2CO (12:1) as eluant. 6,8-Dibromonaringenin (1) (20.2 mg), 8-bromonaringenin (2) (16.9 mg), and naringenin (126 mg) were isolated from the dried extract of the enzymatic bromination. 6,8-Dichloronaringenin (3) (6 mg), 6-chloronaringenin (4) (4.2 mg), and naringenin (135 mg) were isolated from the dried extract of the enzymatic chlorination mixture. 3.5.2.1. 6,8-Dibromonaringenin (1).

Chemical bromination of naringenin The biomimetic reaction of naringenin with bromine was examined under conditions similar to the chlor-operoxidase reaction. The reaction mixture consisted of 7.8 ml of 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 2.75), 1.5 mmol of H2O2, 0.76 mmol of KBr, 20 ml of H2O, and 10 ml of EtOH\u2013Me2CO (1:1). Naringenin (100 mg; 0.37 mmol) dissolved in 4.0 ml of EtOH\u2013Me2CO (1:1) was added to the reaction mixture and thoroughly mixed. Bromine solution (0.76 mmol of Br2 in 400 ml of EtOH) was then slowly added at room temperature with mild stirring. After 45 min, the reaction mixture was extracted with CHCl3 (25 mlNone2). The combined extract was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness. The residue was sub-jected to silica gel GF254 chromatography with toluene\u2013 Me2CO (12:1) as eluant to give 6,8-dibromonaringenin (1) (26 mg) and 8-bromonaringenin (2) (17.0 mg). 3.6.2. Chemical bromination of hesperetin Hesperetin (200 mg; 0.66 mmol) was dissolved in 8.0 ml of EtOH\u2013Me2CO (1:1), then poured into the reac-tion mixture. The reaction mixture contained 14 ml of 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 2.75), 2.6 mmol of H2O2, 1.3 mmol of KBr, 40 ml of H2O, and 20 ml of EtOH-Me2CO (1:1). The reaction was started by slowly adding bromine solution (1.3 mmol of Br2 in 700 ml of EtOH). After 45 min, the reaction mixture was extracted with CHCl3 (45 mlNone2). The combined extract was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness. The residue was applied to silica gel GF254 with toluene\u2013Me2CO (15:1) as eluant to afford 6,8-dibromohesperetin (5) (23.8 mg) and 8-bromonaringenin (6) (26.0 mg). 3.6.3. Chemical chlorination of naringenin The reaction mixture consisted of 14 ml of 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 2.75), 40 ml of H2O, 20 ml of EtOH\u2013Me2CO (1:1), and 200 mg of naringenin dis-solved in 8.0 ml of EtOH\u2013Me2CO (1:1). To the reaction mixture was added dropwise 3.75 ml of sodium hypo-chlorite solution, then, 3.75 ml of HOAc. After stirring the mixture for 1 h at room temperature, the mixture was extracted with CHCl3 (45 mlNone2). The combined extract was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dry-ness. The residue was subjected to silica gel GF254 chromatography with toluene\u2013Me2CO (12:1) as eluant. 6-Chloronaringenin (4) (6 mg) was isolated. Trace amounts of 6,8-dichloronaringenin (3) were observed by silica gel TLC plate. 3.6.4. Chemical chlorination of hesperetin The biomimetic chlorination of hesperetin (200 mg) was performed under similar conditions as above. The dried residue was applied to silica gel GF254 with toluene-346 P. Yaipakdee, L.W. Robertson / Phytochemistry 57 (2001) 341\u2013347 Me2CO (15:1) as eluant, yielding 6-chlorohesperetin (8) (9 mg). Trace amounts of 6,8-dichlorohesperetin (7) were observed by silica gel TLC plate.

        "The whole cells and the chloroperoxidase enzyme of Caldariomyces fumago were capable of halogenating the flavanones, nar-ingenin and hesperetin, at C-6 and C-8 in the presence of either ClNone or BrNone. However, they did not act on other test flavones. The biohalogenated products of naringenin and hesperetin were isolated and found to be identical to those obtained from chemical reactions using molecular halogen and hypohalous acid. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

        "1. Introduction",
        "The use of microbial enzymes for the transformation of organic compounds has been employed as a powerful method in metabolism studies and in modern synthetic organic chemistry for decades (Smith and Rosazza, 1975; Faber, 1992). One of the enzymatic reactions that has been widely studied is a chloroperoxidase-catalyzed halogenation (Franssen, 1994). Chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago (CPO; EC 1.11.1.10) is a well-known enzyme, capable of halogenating a great variety of organic compounds such as b-ketoacids (Shaw and Hager, 1959), cyclic b-diketones (Hager et al., 1966), ster-oids (Levine et al., 1968), alkenes (Yamada et al., 1985), activated aromatic compounds (Wannstedt et al., 1990), and heterocylcic compounds (Franssen et al., 1987). The reaction mechanism of CPO involves the formation of a halogenium ion (X+) or hypohalous acid (HOX) as an intermediate which can effect electrophilic substitution with electron-rich substrates (Yamada et al., 1985; Libby et al., 1992).",
        "The enzymatic halogenation of several flavanones and flavones having electron-donating groups was investi-gated in this study. Flavonoids are very common as secondary metabolites found in nature with a great variety of structural forms and biological activities (Harborne, 1988). The vast literature related to flavo-noid biotransformations is primarily concerned with oxidation, methylation and glucosidation (Ibrahim and Abul-Hajj, 1990a,b; Ibrahim et al., 1997). One study was found on the microbial chlorination of the iso-flavone genistein by Streptomyces griseus and S. plicatus (Anyanwutaku et al., 1992). There are no previous reports on the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed halogenation of flavonoid compounds. Therefore, we examined the use of whole cells and CPO of C. fumago to brominate and chlorinate various flavanones and flavones. The enzy-matic study was also compared with chemical halogena-tion using molecular halogen and hypohalous acid.",
        "2. Results and discussion",
        "The enzymatic bromination and chlorination of fla-vanones and flavones using C. fumago whole cells and CPO gave the results shown in Table 1.With BrNone and ClNone present as halides, both C. fumago and CPO catalyzed the halogenation of the flavanones, naringenin and hesper-etin, but were inactive toward the test flavones. The metabolic products were isolated and identified on the basis of NMR and mass spectral analyses. Mass spectra of halogenated compounds showed typical character-istics of isotope peak, suggesting a number of halogen atoms present in each metabolite.",

        "The biobrominations of naringenin and hesperetin gave 6,8-dibromonaringenin (1), 8-bromonaringenin (2), 6,8-dibromohesperetin (5), and 8-bromohesperetin (6), respectively. The mass spectral analysis indicated the presence of two bromine atoms in 1 and 5 and one bromine atom in 2 and 6. The 1H NMR spectra of bro-minated compounds were similar to those of naringenin and hesperetin, except for the disappearance of two proton signals in 1 and 5 and one proton signal in 2 and 6 at the H-6 and/or H-8 regions (Tables 2 and 3). These data clearly supported that 1 and 5 were dibrominated products having two bromine atoms at positions 6 and 8. The position of the bromine atoms in 2 and 6 were identified by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra. Relative to naringenin and hesperetin, the 13C NMR spectra of 2 and 6 showed a new quaternary carbon signal around 88 ppm, while one of the two methine carbon peaks in the 96 ppm region disappeared (Table 4). This suggested that the bromine atom might be at either C-6 or C-8. HMBC data of 2 showed that the hydroxyl proton at 12.15 ppm (OH-5) had long range couplings to the methine carbon at 96.30 ppm, and two quaternary car-bons at 102.97 and 162.97 ppm corresponding to C-6, C-4a, and C-5, respectively. The methine proton at 6.14 ppm (H-6) showed long range couplings with signals at 88.41 (C-8), 102.97 (C-4a), and 162.97 (C-5 and C-7) ppm. In addition, compounds 2 and 6 gave similar 13C NMR spectral patterns and the carbon signals at C-7 and C-8a of 2 and 6 were shifted upfield by 4.5 ppm compared to those of naringenin and hesperetin. These results indicated that the bromine atom in 2 and 6 must be at C-8.",
        "The enzymatic chlorinations of naringenin and hesper-etin also gave four metabolic products, 6,8-dichloronar-ingenin (3), 6-chloronaringenin (4), 6,8-dichlorohesperetin (7) and 6-chlorohesperetin (8). The mass and 1H NMR spectral analyses of 3 and 7 established the presence of two chlorine atoms at positions 6 and 8. The mass and 1H NMR spectra of 4 and 8 indicated one chlorine atom at either position 6 or 8 (Tables 2 and 3). The 13C NMR",

        "spectra of 4 and 8 showed a quaternary carbon and a methine carbon signals in the C-6 and C-8 regions at lower field compared to those of their precursors (Table 4). The structural assignment of 4 as 6-chlor-onaringenin was supported by a COLOC experiment. The hydroxy proton at None 12.74 (OH-5) had long range couplings to the quaternary signals at 101.02, 103.52, and 160.33 ppm thus corresponding to C-6, C-4a, and C-5, respectively. Since the 13C NMR spectral pattern of 8 was similar to that of 4, the chlorine atom in 8 was placed at C-6. This was supported by the appearance of carbon signals at C-5 and C-7 of 4 and 8 at higher field by about 5 ppm compared to those of naringenin and hesperetin.",
        "It was noted that, when the CPO enzyme was employed to halogenate naringenin and hesperetin, brominated products were obtained in better yields than chlorinated ones (Table 1). This was explainable since the halogenation of CPO is electrophilic and the reactiv-ity of halogenium ions increases in the following order: Cl+, Br+ and I+(Yamada et al., 1985). However, whenC. fumago whole cells were used, yields of chlorinated meta-bolites were higher. This might be due to the weak growth of C. fumago in the medium containing KBr. Overall, the halogenated products were obtained in low yields toge-ther with starting material. The halogenation of the substrates may proceed in competition with the halo-genation of CPO itself at tyrosine residues until the enzyme is no longer active (Wannstedt et al., 1990). Furthermore, since the enzymatic reactions were carried out in suspension, the uptake of the substrates for bio-transformation may be poor.",

The aromatic rings of these compounds possessing a strongly conjugated system were quite stable, and were thus inert to the enzymatic reaction. The relevant flava-nones were reactive since the conjugation in the flavanone system was disrupted by removing the 2,3-double bond. The biomimetic reactions of naringenin and hesperetin with chemical halogenating agents were examined. Their reaction products were identical to those obtained from the enzymatic reactions. The halogenations of nar-ingenin and hesperetin are electrophilic and occurred at the C-6 and C-8 positions on the A-rings. With the two hydroxy groups at C-5 and C-7, the A-rings of naringenin and hesperetin are considerably more nucleophilic and hence reactive towards electrophilic halogenating species than their B-rings.",
