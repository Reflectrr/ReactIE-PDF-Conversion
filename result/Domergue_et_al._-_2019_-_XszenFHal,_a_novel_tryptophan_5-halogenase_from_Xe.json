Halogenated compounds have many applications, as pharmaceutical, agrochemicals or as starting materials for the synthesis of complex molecules. By exploring the sequenced bacterial diversity, we discovered and characterized XszenFHal, a novel FHal from Xenorhabdus szentirmaii, a symbiotic bacterium of entomopathogenic nematode. The substrate scope of XszenFHal was examined and revealed activities towards tryptophan, indole and indole derivatives, leading to the formation of the corresponding 5\u2011chloro products. XszenFHal makes a valuable addition to the panel of flavin\u2011dependent halogenases already discovered and enriches the potential for biotechnology applications by allow\u2011ing access to 5\u2011halogenated indole derivatives.Keywords: Flavin\u2011dependent halogenases, Biocatalysis, Electrophilic halogenation, Regioselectivity, Indole derivatives \u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

Halogenations of aromatic cycles are still an issue in con-ventional synthesis, due to low reactivity and medium selectivity, which makes this route a real challenge on industrial scale. As a possible answer, the use of enzyme catalysed halogenation reaction is particularly inter-esting in a greener context (Fraley and Sherman 2018; Gkotsi et\u00a0al. 2018; Latham et\u00a0al. 2018; Schnepel and Sewald 2017; Weichold et\u00a0al. 2016). Flavin-dependent halogenases (FHals) are halogenating enzymes catalyz-ing electrophilic halogenation of electron-rich aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds. They use harmless alkali halides and are highly regioselective; therefore they represent a promising alternative to conventional halogenation methods (Maddox et\u00a0al. 2015; Mitchell et\u00a0al. 1979; Prakash et\u00a0al. 2004; Samanta and Yamamoto 2015; Schr\u00f6der et\u00a0al. 2012; van Pee 2012).Flavin-dependent halogenases constitute a small enzyme family belonging to the superfamily of flavin-dependent monooxygenases and only few enzymes are described which restricts their application in synthesis (Gkotsi et\u00a0al. 2018; Latham et\u00a0al. 2018; Mascotti et\u00a0al. 2016). The halogenase PrnA was the first FHal to be iden-tified. It catalyses the C7-regioselective halogenation of tryptophan in the biosynthetic pathway of pyrrolnitrin, an antifungal metabolite produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. The purification and characterization of this enzyme reveal that its activity was Flavin Adenine Dinu-cleotide (FAD) dependent and requires a NAD(P)H flavin reductase for  FADH2 supply (Hohaus et\u00a0al. 1997; Keller et\u00a0al. 2000). Structural elucidation of PrnA by X-ray crys-tallography allowed to propose a mechanism for the elec-trophilic regioselective halogenation (Dong et\u00a0al. 2005; Keller et\u00a0al. 2000). FHals are active towards electron-rich substrates such as indole and phenol derivatives, but also \u03b2-keto carbonyl moieties (Jungmann et\u00a0al. 2015; Podze-linska et\u00a0al. 2010; van Pee and Patallo 2006).Many of these enzymes are incorporated in the enzy-matic machinery of polyketide or non-ribosomal peptide Open Access*Correspondence: anne.zaparucha@genoscope.cns.fr\u2020J\u00e9r\u00e9my Domergue and Diane Erdmann contributed equally to this workG\u00e9nomique m\u00e9tabolique, Genoscope, Institut Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, CEA, CNRS, Univ Evry, Universit\u00e9 Paris\u2011Saclay, 91057 Evry, Page 2 of 11Domergue\u00a0et\u00a0al. AMB Expr           (2019) 9:175 synthases and are, therefore, not readily available for bio-catalytic purposes (Buedenbender et\u00a0al. 2009; Chiu et\u00a0al. 2001; Dorrestein et\u00a0al. 2005; Heide et\u00a0al. 2008; Hornung et\u00a0al. 2007; Jungmann et\u00a0al. 2015; Lin et\u00a0al. 2007; Podze-linska et\u00a0al. 2010; Rachid et\u00a0al. 2006; Son et\u00a0al. 2017; Yu et\u00a0 al. 2002). To access new FHals and thus broaden the range of possibilities, one option is to explore the extraor-dinary amount of available genomic resources (Zaparu-cha et\u00a0al. 2018). As halogenated secondary metabolites are widespread compounds, halogenases can be found in various organisms and there are still a lot to discover (Neubauer et\u00a0al. 2018; Smith et\u00a0al. 2013; Son et\u00a0al. 2017). In this study, we explored the sequenced bacterial diver-sity in search of novel flavin-dependent halogenases in order to find enzymes active towards aromatic electron-rich substrates.Materials and\u00a0methodsChemicals and\u00a0materialsAll reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without additional purification. d,l-tryp-tophan, d-tryptophan, l-tryptophan, d,l-tyrosine, 2-amino benzoic acid, 4-amino benzoic acid, 2-amino-5-chloro benzoic acid, 2-amino-3-chloro benzoic acid, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, tryptamine, 3-indoleacetoni-trile, 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)indole, indole, 6-chloro indole, indole-3-pyruvic acid, indole-3-acrylic acid, indole-3-bu-tyric acid, glucose, NADH and FAD were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (MilliporeSigma, StLouis, USA).

Indole-3-propionic acid was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Thermo Fisher (Kandel) GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). 5-Chloro-tryptophan and 5-chloro tryptamine were purchased from Chem Impex International Inc. (Wood Dale, USA). 5-Chloro-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)indole and 5-chloro-indole-3-acetamide were purchased from Oxchem Corporation (Wood Dale, USA). 5-Bromo-tryptophan, 5-chloro-indole-3-acetoni-trile and 5-chloroindole were purchased from Enam-ine (LLC Monmouth Jct, USA). Indole-3-acetamide was purchased from TCI Europe (Zwijndrecht, Belgium). 7-Chloro tryptophan was a generous gift from Dr. Euge-nio P. Patallo (Institut f\u00fcr Biochemie, TU Dresden, 01062 Dresden, Germany) (Zhu et\u00a0al. 2009). Regenera-tion enzyme glucose dehydrogenase 105 (GDH-105) was given by Codexis (Redwood City, USA). For the screen-ing, filter plates were used (Acroprep Advance 96 Fil-ter Plate, 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm GHP, Pall). For reactions in Eppendorf tubes, simple filters were used (0.2\u00a0\u03bcm, PTFE, Merck Millipore). Oligonucleotides were from Sigma-Aldrich (MilliporeSigma, StLouis, USA). E. coli strains BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL were from Agilent technolo-gies (Santa Clara, USA). Enzymatic spectrophotometric screenings in microplates were performed on a Spec-traMax Plus384 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA). Cell-free extracts in 96-microwell plates were heated using a tested thermocycler GeneAmpTM PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, USA). NMR spec-tra were recorded on a Bruker (Bruker, Billerica, USA) 600\u00a0 MHz spectrometer (Evry University, France) for 1H and 13C experiments. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm and referenced with residual solvent signals. Cou-pling constant values (J) are given in hertz. UHPLC-UV analyses were performed on a UHPLC U3000 RS 1034\u00a0 bar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) equipped with a thermostated Column Compartment Rapid Separation (TCC-3000RS) and a diode array detec-tor DAD3000. UHPLC-HRMS analyses were performed on a UHPLC U3000 RS 1034\u00a0bar (Thermo Fisher Sci-entific, Waltham, USA) equipped with a Thermostated Column Compartment Rapid Separation (TCC-3000RS) coupled to ultra-high resolution Orbitrap Elite hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source.Selection of\u00a0candidate enzymesA three-step process was conducted for searching new FHals (Vergne-Vaxelaire et\u00a0al. 2013). First of all, a refer-ence set was created by collecting known proteins from the literature (Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1 and Figure S1). Second, this set was used for protein-versus protein alignments, using the BL2 option (BLAST allowing gaps) and a BLOSUM62 score matrix against UniprotKB and the metagenome from Genoscope using low stringency parameters (> 30% of identity, on 80% of the length) resulting in the selection of 6574 candidate enzymes. Third, to minimize number of candidates, protein sequences were clusterized (80% of similarities) to cre-ate putative isofunctional groups using traditional all-against-all normalized BLASTP scores calculated by the LASSAP suite and a single-linkage algorithm. A repre-sentative candidate was then chosen, one by cluster, if its corresponding bacterial strain was available in the Geno-scope genomic collection. All the sequences too diver-gent to be included in the clustering were chosen if the corresponding genome was available in the Genoscope genomic collection. Missing strains were purchased from DSMZ when available. Representatives of each cluster were cloned and engaged in screening processes.Cloning, expression and\u00a0purificationPrimers were chosen and genes were cloned with a his-tidine tag in N-terminal part in a pET22b(+) (Novagen) modified for ligation independent cloning as already described (Bastard et\u00a0al. 2014). All primers and strains of the selected FHals are listed in Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2 Page 3 of 11Domergue\u00a0et\u00a0al. AMB Expr           (2019) 9:175 and named from FHal1 to FHal148. All the strains along with their identifiers were purchased from DSMZ, CIP or ATCC collections. When DNA samples corresponding to the gene encoding the selected enzyme was not available, PCR was performed on the DNA of another strain from the same species as noted in Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2. All sequences were verified. Each expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL. Cell culture, induction of protein produc-tion and cell lysis were conducted as previously published (Bastard et\u00a0al. 2014). Selected enzymes from the screen-ing (FHal13, FHal16, FHal35, FHal46, FHal57, FHal106) were then purified by loading the clear crude cell extract from 100\u00a0mL of culture onto a Ni\u2013NTA column (QIA-GEN), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The elution buffer was 50\u00a0mM phosphate (pH 7.5), 50\u00a0mM NaCl, 250\u00a0mM imidazole and 10% glycerol. The flavin reductase from E. coli strain K12 (K12Fre) (UniProtKB ID: P0AEN1) was chosen as universal reductase for all FHAls. K12Fre was cloned, overexpressed and purified following the same protocol. Large scale protein purifica-tion was conducted from a 2 \u00d7 500\u00a0mL culture and was performed using a preparative chromatography system (\u00c4kta Pure; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). A fully auto-mated two-step method was set up in which a His Trap FF 5-mL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) column was used in the first purification step. The eluted peak was redi-rected on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200-pg size exclu-sion column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and collected in 50\u00a0mM phosphate (pH 7.5), 50\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM DTT and 10% glycerol. Purified enzymes were stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the NuPAGE system. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Bio-Rad).Enzymatic screening assay on\u00a0aromatic electron\u2011rich substrates The candidate FHals were screened as cell-free extracts in 96-microwell plates. Cell-free extracts were stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C, and thawed out on ice before use. The enzy-matic reactions were carried out on three pools, A\u2013B\u2013C, composed of two substrates (vide infra) (final concen-tration 0.5\u00a0mM each), NaCl (20\u00a0mM), NADH (0.5\u00a0mM), FAD (1\u00a0\u03bcM), cell-free extract (10\u00a0\u03bcL), isopropanol (5\u00a0\u03bcL), phosphate buffer (10\u00a0mM, pH = 7.4) in a final volume of 100\u00a0\u03bcL at RT for 24\u00a0h. TFA (1\u00a0\u03bcL) was then added in each well, followed by 100\u00a0\u03bcL of water (Fig.\u00a01). The microplates were centrifuged at 6000g for 10\u00a0min and the superna-tants were filtrated in new microplates using filter plates (Acroprep Advance 96 Filter Plate, 0.2\u00a0\u00b5m GHP, Pall). A volume of 2\u00a0\u03bcL was then injected on UHPLC according to the conditions described below. Hits were determined by comparison with the reaction with cell-free extract without overexpressed protein. UHPLC analyses were conducted on an Accucore PFP (Thermo Scientific) col-umn (50 * 2.1\u00a0mm, 2.6\u00a0\u03bcm) with eluents A  (H2O + 0.1% formic acid) and B  (CH3CN). Halogenated products were identified by UHPLC by comparison on their retention time with the ones of halogenated standards when avail-able, and by mass spectroscopy.

Proteins have been clustered based on sequence identity (\u2265 80%) and one representative per cluster, for which genomic DNA was available in the Genoscope strain collection, was chosen. From the 417 candidates selected to represent sequence diversity, 148 genes were successfully cloned in an expression vector (Additional file\u00a0 1: Table\u00a0S2). After overexpression of recombinant genes in Escherichia coli strain BL21, cells were lyzed and the proteins were quantified. No extra flavin reductase (Fre) was added as E. coli contains naturally occurring flavin reductases. The candidate enzymes were screened as cell-free extracts against six aromatic electron-rich substrates grouped in three pools of two compounds (Fig.\u00a01). Halogenase activity was assayed by UHPLC-UV. Only four enzymes were found to be very weakly or mod-erately active compared to a blank reaction, FHal13 (Uni-ProtKB ID: Q4J6K2), FHal35 (UniProtKB ID: B7J6K4) and FHal46 (UniProtKB ID: C7PAY7) towards substrates from pool C, and FHal16 (UniProtKB ID: W1J423) towards substrates from pools A and C. The four enzymes cloned with a polyhistidine tag were purified by nickel affinity chromatography for further studies and their activities were verified on single substrate. In our reaction conditions, only FHal16 confirmed to have a halogenase activity and was found to be active towards tryptophan. FHal16, from X. szentirmaii DSM16338, has been named XszenFHal.Characterization of\u00a0XszenFHalXszenFHal, from X. szentirmaii DSM16338, shares ~ 60% sequence identity with PyrH (Uniprot ID: A4D0H5), its closest homolog in the reference set (Gualtieri et\u00a0al. 2014). PyrH is involved in the pyrroindomycin B bio-synthesis, an antibiotic compound produced by Strepto-myces rugosporus LL-42D005, where it catalyzes the C5 chlorination of tryptophan (Zehner et\u00a0al. 2005) (Addi-tional file\u00a01: Figures\u00a0S3 and S4). X. szentirmaii is a symbi-otic bacterium of entomopathogenic nematode (Lengyel et\u00a0 al. 2005). It is known to produce various secondary metabolites, xenofuranones A and B, two phenylpyruvate dimers, szentiamide, a depsipeptide and fabclavines, PK-NRP-polyamine hybrids (Brachmann et\u00a0al. 2006; Ohlen-dorf et\u00a0al. 2011; Wenski et\u00a0al. 2019) (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S4). From all these metabolites, only szentiamide has a tryptophan moiety but it is non chlorinated. The analysis of the genomic context of gene encoding Xsze-nFHal did not reveal any clear metabolic role. Its native substrate is so difficult to hypothesize.Purified XszenFHal was obtained on large scale using fully automated two-step method combining nickel affin-ity and size exclusion chromatography. To evaluate the substrate range of XszenFHal, we screened it against various substrates. Because the preliminary screening showed that XszenFHal was only active towards trypto-phan and had no activity towards tyrosine and aniline derivatives, we focused our study on indole derivatives (Fig.\u00a0 1). Purified XszenFHal and K12Fre were used to optimize the reaction conditions of tryptophan chlo-rination on small scale including glucose dehydrogenase as cofactor regeneration system (Payne et\u00a0al. 2013; van der Donk and Zhao 2003; Yeh et\u00a0al. 2005) (Scheme\u00a01). Standard conditions were then used since no variation in parameters (NADH, FAD, NaCl) has allowed any improvement. Scheme\u00a01 Chlorination of l\u2011tryptophan catalyzed by Page 6 of 11Domergue\u00a0et\u00a0al. AMB Expr           (2019) 9:175 i. Stereospecificity  XszenFHal showed a clear stereopreference for the l-enantiomer with a 98% conversion into the chloro derivative within 6\u00a0h, while the conversion only reached 12% for the d-enantiomer over 24\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a02). ii. Substrate activity profile  XszenFHal was screened against various indole derivatives (7\u201316) (Fig.\u00a01). The enzyme exhib-ited broad scope, seven of the 11 substrates being halogenated with low (entries 2 and 8) to medium (entries 10 and 11) conversions over 24\u00a0h and up to good (entries 10 and 12) conversions over 48\u00a0h (Table\u00a0 1). None of the indole derivatives substi-tuted with carboxylic acid functions was found to be substrate (entries 4\u20137). It is worthy to note that XszenFHal was active towards all the simple indole derivatives with moderate to good conversions (entries 9\u201311) except in the case of the tryptamine for which a low conversion was obtained (entry 8). iii. Regioselectivity  Chlorination by XszenFHal is C5 regioselective as demonstrated by comparison on UHPLC-UV anal-ysis of the products with the UHPLC chromato-grams of halogenated standards (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S2). iv. Halide tolerance  We tested XszenFHal for its ability to catalyze bromination and iodination of l-tryptophan, in addition to chlorination. Under standard condi-tions, XszenFHal fully converted l-tryptophan to the 5-chloro derivative while bromination under the same conditions led to a 64% conversion (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S5). No conversion was observed with NaI.Kinetic constants i. Specific activities  Specific activities were determined with l-trypto-phan under NaCl and NaBr conditions and under NaCl conditions for the other substrates (Table\u00a02). Specific activities were found moderate with l-tryptophan (entries 1\u20132) with ca. 2 times lower activity with NaBr (1.076\u00a0mU/mg) compared to NaCl (2.385\u00a0mU/mg). For indole derivatives, the specific activities were significantly lower, with val-ues at least 10 times lower (entries 3\u20136). ii. Kinetic constants with l-tryptophan  Under NaCl conditions, the kinetic parameters were measured with respective values of  Vm 4.44\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0min-1 (88.8\u00a0U/mg enzyme); Km 58.22\u00a0\u03bcM; kcat 4.44\u00a0min-1 which results in a catalytic effi-ciency of kcat/Km 0.076\u00a0min-1.M-1 (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S6).Discussion In this work, we present the discovery and characteriza-tion of XszenFHal, a novel 5-regioselective tryptophan halogenase belonging to the flavin-dependent haloge-nase family. Only one tryptophan 5-halogenase active towards isolated amino acid has been characterized so far, PyrH (UniProtKB ID A4D0H5) from Streptomy-ces rugosporus, but without study of its substrate range (Zehner et\u00a0al. 2005). Recently, two other 5-regioselective tryptophan halogenases have been identified in biosyn-thetic pathways but they are implied in tailoring modi-fications of metabolites and are active towards tethered peptides. MibH (UniProtKB ID: W2EQU4) is responsible of the 5-chlorination of tryptophan in lantibiotic NAI-107, a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally Fig. 2 a d\u2011 and l\u2011tryptophan conversions by XszenFHal with NaCl over 24 h. b Time course of l\u2011tryptophan conversion by XszenFHal with NaCl over 24 Page 7 of 11Domergue\u00a0et\u00a0al. AMB Expr           (2019) 9:175 modified peptide (RiPP) produced by the actinomycete Microbispora sp. 107891, and Ulm24 (UniProtKB ID: A0A2D3E318) was identified in the genome of Strepto-myces sp. KCB13F003 which produced ulleungmycins A and B, two chlorinated non-ribosomal peptides (NRP) (Ortega et\u00a0al. 2017; Son et\u00a0al. 2017). XszenFHal shares nearly 60% identity with PyrH and Ulm24, and only 30% identity with MibH (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S7).Similar to tryptophan 5-, 6-and 7-halogenases, Xsze-nFHal exhibits residual activity towards substrates in addition to tryptophan (Andorfer et\u00a0al. 2017; Frese et\u00a0 al. 2014; Menon et\u00a0al. 2016; Neubauer et\u00a0al. 2018; Smith et\u00a0al. 2017). Nevertheless, as the examination of the metabolic context of the gene encoding for Xszen-FHal did not provide any indication, there is no formal Table 1 Conversion of\u00a0various substrates by\u00a0XszenFHal with\u00a0NaClEntry Substrate Product Conversion 24h Conversion 48 h 1 1 100% 2 7 4% 5% 3 8 18. 6% 28.8 % 4 9 nd nd 5 10 nd nd 6 11 nd nd 7 12 nd nd 8 4 3.6% 6.8% 9 13 32% 48.5 % 10 14 54.4 % 79.3 % 11 15 54 .1% 58.3 % 12 16 11. 4% 67.5 % Page 8 of 11Domergue\u00a0et\u00a0al. AMB Expr           (2019) 9:175 evidence that tryptophan is the metabolic substrate of XszenFHal. However, XszenFHal kinetic data are con-sistent to the ones of halogenases for which tryptophan is the metabolic substrate (Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S3) (Dong et\u00a0al. 2005; Heemstra and Walsh 2008; Luhavaya et\u00a0 al. 2019; Yeh et\u00a0al. 2005; Zeng and Zhan 2011; Zhu et\u00a0al. 2009). When compared to PyrH, the other 5-regi-oselective tryptophan halogenase, XszenFHal exhib-its kinetic values fairly similar with kcat of 4.44\u00a0min-1 for XszenFHal and 3.56\u00a0min-1 for PyrH, and substrate binding value, Km 58.22\u00a0\u03bcM for XszenFHal and 109 for PyrH, resulting in a higher catalytic efficiency for XszenFHal, kcat/Km 0.076\u00a0min-1\u00a0 M-1 for XszenFHal compared to 0.033\u00a0min-1 for PyrH (Zhu et\u00a0al. 2009). The specific activity values of XszenFHal on the differ-ent substrates show significant differences, with value at least 10 times higher for tryptophan, indicating that it is the best substrate within the tested ones. Trypto-phan (1) and 7-chloro tryptophan (8) were halogen-ated with a 5-regioselectivity, while the 5-hydroxy Table 2 Specific activities of\u00a0XszenFHal on\u00a0various substratesEntry Substrate NaX Specific activity mU/mg1 1 NaCl 2.385 2 1 NaBr 1.076 3 8 NaCl 0.200 4 13 NaCl 0.127 5 14 NaCl 0.121 6 15 NaCl 0.077 One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of 1\u00a0\u00b5M of substrate per Page 9 of 11Domergue\u00a0et\u00a0al. AMB Expr           (2019) 9:175 tryptophan (7) was halogenated with a 7-regioselectiv-ity, which corresponds to the other activated position. In our conditions, the conversion was total for trypto-phan in 24\u00a0h, and much lower for substrates (7) and (8) (Table\u00a01). Very interestingly, XszenFHal exhibited activ-ity towards indole (16) and 3-substituted derivatives (4; 13-15) (Tables\u00a01, 2). These results are promising for synthetic applications. Indeed, under conventional chemistry conditions, no 5-regioselective chlorination of simple indole derivatives is possible except in the case of tryptamine (4) (Somei et\u00a0al. 1995; Hasegawa et\u00a0 al. 1999); for substrates (13\u201315) the 5-regioselec-tive chlorination can occur only when the indole moi-ety is part of a more complex molecule (Bell and Stump Craig; Chatterjee et\u00a0al.; Clerin et\u00a0al.; Laronze et\u00a0al. 2005); regarding simple indole (16), the direct chlorina-tion by conventional synthetic methods undergoes to the formation of 5,7-dichloro indole (2000; Vennemann et\u00a0al.). In addition, halogenated-5 indole and derivatives could be easily modified by metal-catalyzed coupling reactions to produce various compounds (Batail et\u00a0al. 2011). It is worthy to note that combination of bioca-talysis and palladium catalysis gave access to new C\u2013H activation transformations than cannot be achieved by single catalysis (Durak et\u00a0al. 2016; Latham et\u00a0al. 2016; Roy et\u00a0al. 2010).Our studies led to the identification of XszenFHal, a novel tryptophan 5-halogenase from X. szentirmaii. Study of XszenFHal substrate scope revealed that, in addition to tryptophan, XszenFHal is also active towards substituted tryptophan, indole and indole derivatives. It thus completes the range of regioselec-tivities achievable in biocatalysis by allowing the syn-thesis of 5-halogenated tryptophan, indole and indole derivatives. These results show the potential of XszenF-Hal for synthetic applications.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https ://doi.org/10.1186/s1356 8\u2011019\u20110898\u2011y.Additional file\u00a01: Scheme S1.

        "Abstract Flavin\u2011dependent halogenases (FHals) catalyse the halogenation of electron\u2011rich substrates, mainly aromatics. Halogenated compounds have many applications, as pharmaceutical, agrochemicals or as starting materials for the synthesis of complex molecules. By exploring the sequenced bacterial diversity, we discovered and characterized XszenFHal, a novel FHal from Xenorhabdus szentirmaii, a symbiotic bacterium of entomopathogenic nematode. The substrate scope of XszenFHal was examined and revealed activities towards tryptophan, indole and indole derivatives, leading to the formation of the corresponding 5\u2011chloro products. XszenFHal makes a valuable addition to the panel of flavin\u2011dependent halogenases already discovered and enriches the potential for biotechnology applications by allow\u2011ing access to 5\u2011halogenated indole derivatives.Keywords: Flavin\u2011dependent halogenases, Biocatalysis, Electrophilic halogenation, Regioselectivity, Indole derivatives",

        "made.Introduction Halogenated compounds are a major category of mol-ecules in organic chemistry as finished products with applications in pharmacy and agrochemistry, but also as intermediates in metal-catalyzed coupling reactions. Halogenations of aromatic cycles are still an issue in con-ventional synthesis, due to low reactivity and medium selectivity, which makes this route a real challenge on industrial scale. As a possible answer, the use of enzyme catalysed halogenation reaction is particularly inter-esting in a greener context (Fraley and Sherman 2018; Gkotsi et\u00a0al. 2018; Latham et\u00a0al. 2018; Schnepel and Sewald 2017; Weichold et\u00a0al. 2016). Flavin-dependent halogenases (FHals) are halogenating enzymes catalyz-ing electrophilic halogenation of electron-rich aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds. They use harmless alkali halides and are highly regioselective; therefore they represent a promising alternative to conventional halogenation methods (Maddox et\u00a0al. 2015; Mitchell et\u00a0al. 1979; Prakash et\u00a0al. 2004; Samanta and Yamamoto 2015; Schr\u00f6der et\u00a0al. 2012; van Pee",
        "2012).Flavin-dependent halogenases constitute a small enzyme family belonging to the superfamily of flavin-dependent monooxygenases and only few enzymes are described which restricts their application in synthesis (Gkotsi et\u00a0al. 2018; Latham et\u00a0al. 2018; Mascotti et\u00a0al. 2016). The halogenase PrnA was the first FHal to be iden-tified. It catalyses the C7-regioselective halogenation of tryptophan in the biosynthetic pathway of pyrrolnitrin, an antifungal metabolite produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. The purification and characterization of this enzyme reveal that its activity was Flavin Adenine Dinu-cleotide (FAD) dependent and requires a NAD(P)H flavin reductase for  FADH2 supply (Hohaus et\u00a0al. 1997; Keller et\u00a0al. 2000). Structural elucidation of PrnA by X-ray crys-tallography allowed to propose a mechanism for the elec-trophilic regioselective halogenation (Dong et\u00a0al. 2005; Keller et\u00a0al. 2000). FHals are active towards electron-rich substrates such as indole and phenol derivatives, but also \u03b2-keto carbonyl moieties (Jungmann et\u00a0al. 2015; Podze-linska et\u00a0al. 2010; van Pee and Patallo",
        "2006).Many of these enzymes are incorporated in the enzy-matic machinery of polyketide or non-ribosomal peptide",

To access new FHals and thus broaden the range of possibilities, one option is to explore the extraor-dinary amount of available genomic resources (Zaparu-cha et\u00a0al. 2018). As halogenated secondary metabolites are widespread compounds, halogenases can be found in various organisms and there are still a lot to discover (Neubauer et\u00a0al. 2018; Smith et\u00a0al. 2013; Son et\u00a0al. 2017).

        "source.Selection of\u00a0candidate enzymesA three-step process was conducted for searching new FHals (Vergne-Vaxelaire et\u00a0al. 2013). First of all, a refer-ence set was created by collecting known proteins from the literature (Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1 and Figure S1). Second, this set was used for protein-versus protein alignments, using the BL2 option (BLAST allowing gaps) and a BLOSUM62 score matrix against UniprotKB and the metagenome from Genoscope using low stringency parameters (> 30% of identity, on 80% of the length) resulting in the selection of 6574 candidate enzymes. Third, to minimize number of candidates, protein sequences were clusterized (80% of similarities) to cre-ate putative isofunctional groups using traditional all-against-all normalized BLASTP scores calculated by the LASSAP suite and a single-linkage algorithm. A repre-sentative candidate was then chosen, one by cluster, if its corresponding bacterial strain was available in the Geno-scope genomic collection. All the sequences too diver-gent to be included in the clustering were chosen if the corresponding genome was available in the Genoscope genomic collection. Missing strains were purchased from DSMZ when available. Representatives of each cluster were cloned and engaged in screening",
        "processes.Cloning, expression and\u00a0purificationPrimers were chosen and genes were cloned with a his-tidine tag in N-terminal part in a pET22b(+) (Novagen) modified for ligation independent cloning as already described (Bastard et\u00a0al. 2014). All primers and strains of the selected FHals are listed in Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2",

        "and named from FHal1 to FHal148. All the strains along with their identifiers were purchased from DSMZ, CIP or ATCC collections. When DNA samples corresponding to the gene encoding the selected enzyme was not available, PCR was performed on the DNA of another strain from the same species as noted in Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2. All sequences were verified. Each expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL. Cell culture, induction of protein produc-tion and cell lysis were conducted as previously published (Bastard et\u00a0al. 2014). Selected enzymes from the screen-ing (FHal13, FHal16, FHal35, FHal46, FHal57, FHal106) were then purified by loading the clear crude cell extract from 100\u00a0mL of culture onto a Ni\u2013NTA column (QIA-GEN), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

When compared to PyrH, the other 5-regi-oselective tryptophan halogenase, XszenFHal exhib-its kinetic values fairly similar with kcat of 4.44\u00a0min-1 for XszenFHal and 3.56\u00a0min-1 for PyrH, and substrate binding value, Km 58.22\u00a0\u03bcM for XszenFHal and 109 for PyrH, resulting in a higher catalytic efficiency for XszenFHal, kcat/Km 0.076\u00a0min-1\u00a0 M-1 for XszenFHal compared to 0.033\u00a0min-1 for PyrH (Zhu et\u00a0al. 2009). The specific activity values of XszenFHal on the differ-ent substrates show significant differences, with value at least 10 times higher for tryptophan, indicating that it is the best substrate within the tested ones. Trypto-phan (1) and 7-chloro tryptophan (8) were halogen-ated with a 5-regioselectivity, while the 5-hydroxy",

        "tryptophan (7) was halogenated with a 7-regioselectiv-ity, which corresponds to the other activated position. In our conditions, the conversion was total for trypto-phan in 24\u00a0h, and much lower for substrates (7) and (8) (Table\u00a01). Very interestingly, XszenFHal exhibited activ-ity towards indole (16) and 3-substituted derivatives (4; 13-15) (Tables\u00a01, 2). These results are promising for synthetic applications. Indeed, under conventional chemistry conditions, no 5-regioselective chlorination of simple indole derivatives is possible except in the case of tryptamine (4) (Somei et\u00a0al. 1995; Hasegawa et\u00a0 al. 1999); for substrates (13\u201315) the 5-regioselec-tive chlorination can occur only when the indole moi-ety is part of a more complex molecule (Bell and Stump Craig; Chatterjee et\u00a0al.; Clerin et\u00a0al.; Laronze et\u00a0al. 2005); regarding simple indole (16), the direct chlorina-tion by conventional synthetic methods undergoes to the formation of 5,7-dichloro indole (2000; Vennemann et\u00a0al.). In addition, halogenated-5 indole and derivatives could be easily modified by metal-catalyzed coupling reactions to produce various compounds (Batail et\u00a0al. 2011). It is worthy to note that combination of bioca-talysis and palladium catalysis gave access to new C\u2013H activation transformations than cannot be achieved by single catalysis (Durak et\u00a0al. 2016; Latham et\u00a0al. 2016; Roy et\u00a0al.",
        "2010).Our studies led to the identification of XszenFHal, a novel tryptophan 5-halogenase from X. szentirmaii. Study of XszenFHal substrate scope revealed that, in addition to tryptophan, XszenFHal is also active towards substituted tryptophan, indole and indole derivatives. It thus completes the range of regioselec-tivities achievable in biocatalysis by allowing the syn-thesis of 5-halogenated tryptophan, indole and indole derivatives. These results show the potential of XszenF-Hal for synthetic",
