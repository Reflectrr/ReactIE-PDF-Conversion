Walsh* and Timothy A. Wencewicz Covering: up to the end of May 2012 Riboflavin-based coenzymes, tightly bound to enzymes catalyzing substrate oxidations and reductions, enable an enormous range of chemical transformations in biosynthetic pathways. Flavoenzymes catalyze substrate oxidations involving amine and alcohol oxidations and desaturations to olefins, the latter setting up Diels\u2013Alder cyclizations in lovastatin and solanapyrone biosyntheses. Both C4a and N5 of the flavin coenzymes are sites for covalent adduct formation. For example, the reactivity of dihydroflavins with molecular oxygen leads to flavin-4a-OOH adducts which then carry out a diverse range of oxygen transfers, including Baeyer\u2013Villiger type ring expansions, olefin epoxidations, halogenations via transient HOCl generation, and an oxidative Favorskii rerrangement during enterocin assembly. 1 Introduction 2 Canonical features of \ue104avoenzymes 3 Common types of redox transformations catalyzed by \ue104avoenzymes 3.1 Reductive half reactions 3.2 Reoxidative half reactions 4 Biosynthetic niches for \ue104avoprotein oxidoreductases: The reductive half reaction 4.1 Flavin-mediated desaturations to conjugated ole\ue103ns 4.1.1 Chain length regioselectivity of an enoyl reductase in lovastatin biosynthesis sets up the Diels\u2013Alder cycli-zation intermediate 4.1.2 Homologous in trans enoyl reductase \ue104avoproteins 4.1.3 Desaturation of a tethered glutamine in indigoidine biosynthesis 4.1.4 Protein backbone thiazoline and oxazoline aroma-tizing desaturations 4.1.5 The desaturase CpaO triggers the pentacyclic scaffold in cyclopiazonate 4.2 Flavin-mediated oxidations at HC\u2013XH (X \u00bc O,N,S) centers 4.2.1 Amine oxidations 4.2.2 Alcohol oxidations 4.2.2.1 A Diels\u2013Alder cyclization set up by alcohol oxidation to aldehyde 4.2.3 Thiol oxidations olecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical 2115, USA.

View Article Onlinethe nascent scaffolds can occur during one or more elongation cycles or can occur in a set of post-assembly enzymatic tailoring steps.3,4 Among the common tailoring paradigms are acylations, glycosylations, methylations, and redox reactions. The redox transformations are typically oxidations of scaf-folds (e.g. hydroxylation, epoxidation, oxygen insertions), but less o\ue09den can be reductive, for example, in the release of pep-tidyl thioesters from nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly lines as aldehydes or alcohols.5,6 While nicotinamide coenzymes (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)) are the most common coen-zymes involved in redox transformations in primary metabolic pathways, \ue104avin-dependent enzymes are heavily utilized in secondary pathways and they are the focus of this review, as they enable a broad swath of chemistry. In turn \ue104avins and iron, both in heme and nonheme contexts, overlap in their abilities to reductively activate and insert oxygen into natural product scaffolds; we will note the cases where \ue104avin coenzymes provide sufficient activation. 2 Canonical features of flavoenzymes In contrast to nicotinamide coenzymes, which typically disso-ciate from partner enzymes a\ue09der each catalytic turnover,7 \ue104avin coenzymes are bound so tightly (mostly noncovalently but some covalent linkages to the apoproteins are known) that, except in rare purposeful exceptions, they do not dissociate from their protein partners.8 This tight binding has likely evolved due to the lability of dihydro\ue104avins (FMN and FAD) to undergo rapid, uncontrolled autoxidation outside the controlled microenvi-ronments of enzyme active sites.9 In turn, it means that \ue104a-voenzymes operate in each catalytic cycle by way of two half reactions.10 In the \ue103rst a substrate is oxidized while the bound oxidized \ue104avin (most of the time FAD rather than FMN) becomes reduced; this is sometimes referred to as the reductive half reaction (Fig. 1a). In a second reoxidative half reaction, the Christopher T. Walsh, born in 1944, majored in biology at Harvard and completed his PhD in biochemistry in the group of Fritz Lipmann at The Rockefeller University. A\ue09der spending two years in the laboratory of Robert H. Abeles at Brandeis University as a Helen Hay Whitney post-doctoral fellow he joined the MIT Faculty (1972\u20131987) and since then has been at Harvard Medical School. He served as Chair of the Department of Chemistry at MIT (1978\u20131982), Chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry & Molecular Pharma-cology at Harvard Medical School (1987\u20131995), and President of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (1992\u20131995). His research interests lie in deciphering the molecular logic and enzymatic machinery of natural product biosynthesis. 176 | Nat. Prod. Rep., 2013, 30, 175\u2013200 reoxidation of the reduced \ue104avin back to the oxidized form occurs as some cosubstrate is reduced (Fig. 1b). Thus the \ue104avins act as true coenzymes not cosubstrates (unlike stoichiometric NADH oxidation to NAD) and do not show up in reaction stoichiometries. The tricyclic isoalloxazine ring system of FMN and FAD offers great redox versatility, explaining why \ue104avoproteins sit at so many cellular redox crossroads.10 Both one-electron and two-electron redox manifolds are kinetically and thermodynami-cally accessible (Fig. 2), so the one-electron reduced semi-quinone (FlH_) and the two-electron reduced dihydro\ue104avin (FlH2) are both biologically relevant. Flavoproteins can thus serve as step down transformers between two-electron only manifolds (e.g. the hydride-donating (NAD(P)H), and obligate one-electron redox partners (e.g. FeIII/FeII). From the point of view of mechanism, depending on the chemical features of the cosubstrates, \ue104avin-containing Timothy A. Wencewicz, born in 1983, graduated from Southeast Missouri State University in 2006 with a B.S. in chemistry and applied mathematics. He obtained his PhD in 2011 under the supervision of Marvin J. Miller at the University of Notre Dame as a NIH-sponsored Chemistry-Biochemistry-Biology Interface Program fellow where he focused on developing path-ogen-targeted antibacterial drug delivery technologies based on bacterial siderophores. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in the laboratory of Christopher T. Walsh where his research has focused on studying the biosynthesis of unusual, nonproteinogenic amino acids.

View Article Onlineenzymes can generate and react with substrate carbanion equivalents, radical equivalents, and hydride equivalents. The one-electron reactivity of both the FlH2 and FlH_oxidation states is the key determinant in allowing these enzyme-coenzyme systems to react with O2, in contrast to air-stable NAD(P)H coenzymes.7,11 Covalent adducts form in some \ue104avoenzyme-mediated transformations between sites on the isoalloxazine ring of the coenzyme and a reacting center of the substrate. In particular N5 is a site of hydride addition for Flox and a site of hydride ejection from FlH2 in the reverse direction.12 N5 is also the site of covalent addition by substrate carbanions.13 In parallel, the bridgehead C4a position is the site of covalent connection with thiols14 and also with radical oxygen species, such as superoxide equivalents to yield 4a-peroxides (Fig. 3).9 We will note the double-headed reactivity of the Fl-4a-OOH intermediates in speci\ue103c cases below. A small set of \ue104avoenzymes have the isoalloxazine ring covalently tethered to an amino acid side chain (e.g. His or Cys) through the 8a-methyl or C6, indicating that those atoms can be electrophilic.15 3 Common types of redox transformations catalyzed by flavoenzymes 3.1 Reductive half reactions In the reductive half reactions, four types of cosubstrates are typically oxidized by two-electrons, as noted in Fig. 4a. Substrates with acid groupings (free acids or, more easily, thioesters) are desaturated to the conjugated carbonyl products (e.g. succinate to fumarate). These typically start with removal of one of the prochiral methylene hydrogens from Ca as a proton. The Cb-H could be ejected as a hydride equivalent or it could move as a hydrogen atom, as suggested for acyl CoA dehydro-genases,16 re\ue104ecting net oxidation of the Ca carbanion/thioester enolate in two one-electron steps. A second large category of oxidations occur at H-C-XH centers, where X\u00bcO (alcohol), N This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 (amine) or S (thiol). There are also \ue104avin-dependent aldehyde (RCHO) oxidases, generating carboxylic acid products. Depending on the nature of the heteroatom, reaction manifolds can be viewed as involving (a) H+ and substrate carbanion, (b) H_ and C_ radicals, or (c) HNone and a carbonium ion like transition state, within this large substrate class, with hydride transfer as the most common mechanism. The third group encompasses oxidation of dithiols to disul\ue103des, typically involving Fl-4a-thiol adducts as schematized in Fig. 3. The last major group involves a large family of \ue104avoenzymes oxidizing NADPH to NADP, by hydride transfer from the reduced nicotinamide coenzymes to N5 of the bound FAD. 3.2 Reoxidative half reactions For most \ue104avoenzymes the second half reaction involves directed reoxidation of bound FADH2/FMNH2, generated by the suite of reductive half reactions noted above. These could involve formal reversal of the \ue103rst half reactions. One such fate, in the second half reaction, is a net transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH or NADH. This involves hydride transfer back out from N5 of FlH2 and represents the two-electron at a time manifold. Nat. Prod.

View Article OnlineFumarate reductases in anaerobic bacteria create succinate as the end product as they dump electrons from their respiratory chains. Glutathione reductases spend NADPH to generate bound FlH2, which in turn drives the reduction of the oxidized inter-molecular disul\ue103de form of glutathione back to the thiol-con-taining tripeptide (GSH) to high levels of that thiol in cells. The one-electron manifold is seen in such enzymes as succinate dehydrogenases, which during reoxidation of FlH2 transfer one electron at a time to iron-sulfur clusters, in a separate domain (three in succinate dehydrogenase before electron transfer to a membrane soluble quinone). Of particular interest for \ue104avoenzyme transformations in biosynthetic pathways is the one-electron reoxidation manifold for reaction with O2. This is formulated as one-electron transfer from FlH2 to yield superoxide anion (one-electron reduced dioxygen, pKa \u00bc 4.8)) and the \ue104avin semiquinone, FlH_ (Fig. 4b), followed by radical recombination at the bridgehead C4a to yield the 4a-\ue104avin hydroperoxide.9,17 We will note four distinct fates for this peroxide in speci\ue103c examples below. 178 | Nat. Prod. Rep., 2013, 30, 175\u2013200 The simplest outcome is release of H2O2 by elimination and proton transfer, a net \ue104avoenzyme oxidase reaction, as Flox is regenerated for the next catalytic cycle. Alternatively cleavage of the O\u2013O bond in the \ue104avin-4a-OOH can occur with transfer of an electrophilic oxygen atom to an electron rich cosubstrate (e.g. in phenol hydroxylations to catechols). This is a monooxygenase outcome. We will note two additional variant fates for the Fl-4a-OOH: conversion to an HOCl equivalent in halogenase active sites for substrate halogenation; and behavior of the peroxy-\ue104avin as a nucleophilic equivalent in Baeyer\u2013Villigerase trans-formations. Many of the interesting biosynthetic tailoring reactions that result in oxygen transfer to nascent product scaffolds involve directed reactivity of the tightly bound Fl-4a-OOH equivalent along these four outcomes in the reoxidative half reactions. 4 Biosynthetic niches for flavoprotein oxidoreductases: The reductive half reaction 4.1 Flavin-mediated desaturations to conjugated ole\ue103ns The \ue104avoenzyme-mediated desaturation of adjacent sp3 carbon centers ab to a carbonyl group in substrates is a key energy yielding step in the citric acid cycle (succinate to fumarate). This process is also central to the harvesting of energy in fatty acyl CoA b-oxidations. The reverse, saturation of the ab-enoyl-S-carrier proteins by FAD-containing enoyl-ACP reductases, is the physiologic mechanism for adding hydrogens and electrons to be stored in the long methylene chains of saturated fatty acyl-S-ACP during fatty acid biosynthesis. These enoyl reductases are important catalysts in both fatty acid and polyketide scaffold constructions. Acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) are 8\u201310 kDa proteins where a speci\ue103c serine side chain has been post-translationally modi\ue103ed with the phosphopantetheine moiety from coenzyme A to provide a reactive thiol arm on which to assemble and grow the acyl chains.18,19 4.1.1 CHAIN LENGTH REGIOSELECTIVITY OF AN ENOYL REDUC-TASE IN LOVASTATIN BIOSYNTHESIS SETS UP THE DIELS\u2013ALDER CYCLIZATION INTERMEDIATE. With parallel logic and protein machinery to the fatty acid synthases, polyketide synthases (PKS), both the disassembled type II PKS and the multimodular type I PKS assembly lines,19 similarly have enoyl-S-ACP reduc-tases. However, in the fungal type I PKS enzyme LovB in lova-statin assembly, the ER domain within the LovB protein is inactive.20 Instead, a separate protein LovC21 is an enoyl reductase that acts in trans to reduce the conjugated enoyl group only at the tetraketide, pentaketide, and heptaketide stages (Fig. 5), but not at the diketide, triketide or hexaketide stages of chain elongation. (The basis for this selectivity is not under-stood but is highly consequential.) Therefore, the conjugated bis-ole\ue103n built by the triketide stage of chain elongation persists and subsequent failure to act at the hexaketide stage then creates a triole\ue103nic intermediate. It is this triene that undergoes a Diels\u2013Alder cyclization.21 LovC then acts reductively again at the heptaketide and octaketide stages. The Diels\u2013Alder cyclization is enabled by the selective inactivity of LovC and the consequent persistence of the three ole\ue103ns at the hexaketide stage.

A comparable strategy exists in the generation of the polyole\ue103nic NRP-PK hybrid bacillaene by B. subtilis. During chain elongation an in trans enoyl reductase PksE acts regio-speci\ue103cally to saturate the C14, C15 ole\ue103n while eight other ole\ue103ns in the scaffold are untouched.22 A homolog PfaD has also been shown to act in trans in controlled reduction of nascent double bonds in bacterial biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Sorting out the recognition rules for selective ole\ue103n reduction is one of the remaining challenges in \ue103guring out how to redirect enoyl reductase regiochemistries for combina-torial biosynthesis. 4.1.3 DESATURATION OF A TETHERED GLUTAMINE IN INDIGOI-DINE BIOSYNTHESIS. The purple pigment indigoidine (Fig. 6) is generated as a virulence factor, possibly as an oxygen radical scavenger, by the phytopathogenic bacterium Erwinia chrys-anthemi and also other pathogens and saprophytic bacteria such as S. lavendulae.23\u201325 The indigoidine chromophore arises from dimerization (nonenzymatic?) of 5-amino-3H-pyridine-2,6-one, which is the nascent product released from a mono-modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) protein IndC. IndC has four predicted functional domains, C-A-Ox-T. The N-terminal condensation domain (C) seems incomplete and likely inactive. The adenylation (A) domain activates glutamine and tethers it on the phosphopantetheinyl thiolate arm of the holo form of the thiolation (T) domain.24 The oxidase (Ox) domain is analogous to several \ue104avoprotein domains noted in the next section that oxidize thiazolines to thiazoles,26,27 and so has been proposed to be a \ue104avin-dependent desaturase, converting Cb-and CgNoneCH2 groups to the conjugated ole\ue103n. This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 This could happen before intramolecular capture of the thio-ester by the d-carboxamide nitrogen during the release step from the NRPS, or a\ue09der release of the saturated cyclic piper-idinedione (Fig. 6). The dimerization is proposed to be nonen-zymatic and can be catalyzed in air. It is the extensive conjugation, introduced by the \ue104avin oxidase (desaturase) domain, in the dimerized indigoidine that gives the purple color and the chemical ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species. 4.1.4 PROTEIN BACKBONE THIAZOLINE AND OXAZOLINE AROMA-TIZING DESATURATIONS. There are two contexts in which the side chains of Cys, Ser, and Thr residues can be cyclized onto the upstream peptide bond to create backbone heterocycles. One is in the posttranslational modi\ue103cation of ribosomally produced small bacterial proteins of 50\u201360 residues.26,27 The second is on NRPS and hybrid NRPS-PKS assembly lines.28 In both contexts, an RCONH-Cys amide is cyclodehydrated to a thiazoline and RCONH-Ser and -Thr amides are cyclized to the corresponding oxazoline/methyloxazoline (Fig. 7a). The thiazoline and oxazo-line rings can persist, as they do in some of the nonribosomal peptide cases where these dihydroheterocycles form part of the ligand set for tight binding to FeIII in siderophores, e.g. in yer-siniabactin and vibriobactin (Fig. 7b) which act as bacterial and fungal virulence factors.28 These thiazoline/oxazoline rings can also be converted to the heteroaromatic thiazoles, oxazoles, and methyloxazoles by action of \ue104avoprotein desaturases (Fig. 7a). In the nonribosomal peptide synthetase context, as in the example of IndC above, a \ue104avin-dependent oxidase (Ox) domain is inserted into a loop of the adenylation domain of an NRPS module. Thus, in the assembly line for the hybrid peptide/polyketide antitumor epothilones, the EpoB subunit is a C-A-Ox-T four domain module (just like IndC above). It activates and tethers cysteine and interacts with an upstream PKS subunit EpoA bearing an acetyl-S-pantetheinyl group (Fig. 8a). The C domain of EpoB transfers the acetyl moiety to the NH2 of the tethered Cys and Nat. Prod.

View Article Onlinethen cyclodehydrates it to the thiazolinyl-S-T domain species.29 Now the Ox domain acts as a typical \ue104avoprotein desaturase, presumably abstracting the acidic Ca-H as a proton and ejecting the Cb-H as a hydride to N5 of the bound \ue104avin coenzyme. The result of this desaturation is the conversion of the dihy-drothiazoline to the heteroaromatic planar methylthiazolyl-S-EpoB. This acyl group is then transferred downstream to the polyketide synthase machinery, ultimately building the 16-member macrocyclic framework. The methylthiazole is a key activity determinant for this antimitotic cancer drug. Analo-gously, the bithiazole moiety of the antitumor drug bleomycin (Fig. 8b) is assembled from Cys-Cys residues on an NRPS protein by tandem cyclodehydration and desaturation.30,31 The bithiazole has the right dimensions to be a DNA intercalator and this drug acts to cause double strand breaks via oxidative damage of DNA.32 Comparable logic and machinery27 is employed for post-translational maturation of the preprotein forms of microcin B17,33 thiazolyl peptide antibiotics,34 goadsporin,35 and planta-zolicin (Fig. 9).36,37 In these cases a 50\u201360 residue protein emerges from the bacterial ribosome as a precursor. The N-180 | Nat. Prod. Rep., 2013, 30, 175\u2013200 terminal 25\u201340 residues act as a leader peptide38 (that ultimately gets removed by proteolysis) while the C-terminal 15\u201340 resi-dues undergo posttranslational maturations which include formation of thiazoles, oxazoles, and methyloxazoles. In these cases, the leader peptide is most likely an amphipathic helix that functions as a recognition element for recruitment of the cyclodehydratases and desaturases that make thiazolines and oxazolines and then convert them to the thiazole and oxazole rings. These rings replace hydrolyzable peptide backbones, rigidify the peptide scaffolds and restrict conformational \ue104exi-bility, likely increasing affinity for their biological targets. The microcin B17 system is the one best characterized for the cyclodehydration and desaturation enzyme activities and also for its antibiotic action on its target DNA gyrase.39 In both contexts the \ue104avoprotein desaturases act at the last step, and the redox change drives the morphing of amide/peptide backbones into nonhydrolyzable heterocycles. 4.1.5 THE DESATURASE CPAO TRIGGERS THE PENTACYCLIC SCAFFOLD IN CYCLOPIAZONATE. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is an Aspergillus metabolite that acts as a vertebrate toxin because of nanomolar affinity to the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase.40 This pentacyclic indole tetramic acid scaffold is assembled in a short efficient three enzyme pathway by the producing fungi. The CpaS enzyme is a hybrid PKS-NRPS that uses malonyl CoA and tryptophan to form and release the tetramic acid cyclo-acetoa-cetyl-Trp (Fig. 10a).41 CpaD is a regioselective prenyl transferase that installs the dimethylallyl group at C4 of the indole ring of the CpaS product to yield b-CPA.42 The third and last enzyme in the pathway is CpaO, with a covalently bound FAD,43 which converts b-CPA to a-CPA, in the process creating the middle two -6-5-rings in the \ue103nal 6-5-6-5-5 pentacyclic scaffold. Although the mechanism of CpaO is not fully determined, one can propose a variant of the typical desaturase pathway for the transformation (Fig. 10b). The oxidation would start with removal of one of the two prochiral hydrogens from the b-methylene of the indole moiety with electron \ue104ow into the indole and ejection of the hydrogen on the indole nitrogen as a hydride to N5 of the bound FAD. This set of steps would yield the conjugated imine as transient product along with FADH2, which gets reoxidized by O2 (see next section of \ue104avoprotein oxygen reactions). That conjugated imine is an excellent electron sink and the double cyclization could be initiated by intramolecular attack of the weak amide nucleophile from the tetramate onto the ole\ue103n of the dime-thylallyl moiety with those p-electrons in turn attacking the newly generated conjugated imine. This double cyclization cascade creates the fused pentacyclic framework of the fungal toxin. The examples noted in this section indicate the versatility of \ue104avin coenzymes acting formally in conjugated ole\ue103n-creating desaturations. In the speci\ue103c natural product biosynthetic contexts discussed, these redox changes in nascent product frameworks create potentially reactive functionalities for Diels\u2013 Alder cyclizations, for morphing peptide backbones into \ue103ve-membered ring heterocycles, and for initiating a ring-forming cascade in cyclopiazonate formation. We will note another \ue104avoprotein-enabled Diels\u2013Alder cyclization in the next section.

For our biosynthetic purposes these reductive half reactions are not particularly noteworthy mech-anistically but we describe examples in natural product contexts where subsequent transformations of note are thereby enabled. 4.2.1 AMINE OXIDATIONS. There are a variety of natural products that contain pyrrole moieties that arise from the readily available amino acid proline.44 These include the pyrrole moieties in prodigiosin and pyrrolomycin and in the antibiotics clorobiocin, coumermycin, and kibdelomycin (Fig. 11a).45 The origin of these pyrrole heterocycles thus differs from the ami-nolevulinate pathway leading to porphobilinogen and ulti-mately the tetrapyrrole macrocycles in the porphyrins, corrins, and chlorophyll frameworks. The conversion of proline to pyrrole carboxylate occurs while the proline is tethered in thioester to the pantetheinyl thiol arm on NRPS modules,46 in some analogy to the logic discussed in the previous sections. Proline is selected by an adenylation domain, activated as prolyl-AMP and captured by the thiol of the pantetheinyl prosthetic group of a holo T domain to yield the prolyl-S-protein (Fig. 11b). Now a free standing FAD-linked dehydrogenase converts the prolyl-S-PCP to a two electron oxidized product. This undergoes further two electron oxidation to the pyrrolyl-S-carrier protein in a process that may re\ue104ect uncatalyzed oxidative aromatization to the pyrrole. Because of its kinetic instability it is not yet clear if the two electron This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 oxidized intermediate arises from the \ue104avoproteins acting as amine dehydrogenases (DH), conversion of the HC\u2013NH to the C]N group via a D2-pyrrolinyl-S-PCP, or whether this is an a,b-desaturase, yielding the 2,3-dehydroprolyl-S-PCP as nascent product. In either case the subsequent two electron oxidation yields the pyrrole in an activated acyl linkage for subsequent transfer to a nucleophilic cosubstrate. A related double oxida-tion of the cyclic imine arising from Lys oxidation yields the pyridine carboxylate monomer on the way to the unusual 2,20-bipyridyl moiety of collismycin A.47 The biosynthesis of the hexacyclic aglycone scaffold of the antitumor indolocarbazoles,48,49 exempli\ue103ed by rebeccamycin and staurosporine (Fig. 12) involves an alternating set of two \ue104avoproteins and two hemeproteins to couple two tryptophans in a process resulting in removal of 10\u201314 electrons as the indolocarbazole framework is assembled.50 This short pathway starts with the action of the \ue104avoprotein RebO, followed by the hemeprotein RebD, to convert two molecules of L-Trp to chro-mopyrrolic acid (Fig. 12a). RebO is a conventional amine oxidase, converting each Trp to the imino acid. Condensation of one imine with a tautomeric enamine (before hydrolysis yields the inactive indolepyruvates) could yield the indicated adduct which can be captured by hemeprotein RebD acting via high valent iron intermediates to conduct one-electron chemistry, generating a benzylic radical that can lead to the C\u2013C bond in the incipient pyrrole of chromopyrrolic acid, six electrons oxidized from the starting pair of tryptophans.51 The further processing requires a reprise of the two types of \ue104avin and heme enzymes: RebC a \ue104avoprotein oxygenase and RebP a hemeprotein. RebP is involved in the aryl-aryl coupling to convert the chromopyrrolic acid scaffold to the Nat. Prod.

The four enzymes, two FAD-enzymes and two heme enzymes, of the rebeccamycin pathway remove 14 electrons from the substrates/ intermediates as the indolocarbazole framework is generated. The last example of a \ue104avoenzyme involved in a HC\u2013NH oxidation to be featured in this section is orf Af12070, from Aspergillus fumigatus, involved in late stages of fumiquinazoline peptide alkaloid biosynthesis.52 Like the indolocarbazole biosynthetic pathway noted above, this also is a short, efficient one, with only four enzymes needed to convert anthranilate, tryptophan, and two alanines to the heptacyclic scaffold of fumiquinazoline C (FQC). The substrate for Af12070 is fumi-quinazoline A (FQA) and it appears that the puri\ue103ed enzyme acts as an amine oxidase, oxidizing the secondary amine in the pyrazinone ring to the corresponding imine (Fig. 13). That undergoes intramolecular capture by the indicated \u2013OH group (in turn introduced by an earlier \ue104avoenzyme action in this pathway, noted in the oxygenase section below), generating a hemiaminal linkage in a seven membered ring and in so doing 182 | Nat. Prod. Rep., 2013, 30, 175\u2013200 joining two tricyclic entities in the substrate to yield the remarkably complex architecture of the FQC product. The nascent imine is in equilibrium with the FQC hemiaminal because over a period of days the FQC kinetic product converts to the aminal in the thermodynamic product, fumiquinazoline D (FQD), an alternate heptacyclic framework. Af12070 is a complexity-generating redox catalyst and the HC\u2013NH moiety oxidized is not a standard amine, but instead has elements of an amide system within the pyrazinone heterocycle. 4.2.2 ALCOHOL OXIDATIONS. One recent example of note for a \ue104avoprotein alcohol oxidase is Dbv2953 (Dbv for dalbavancin) which acts late in the maturation pathway for the glycopeptide antibiotic A40926, a teicoplanin and vancomycin analog (Fig. 14a). A40926 has the N-acylated glucosamine sugar char-acteristic of teicoplanins but also has C6 of that sugar at the acid rather than the usual alcohol oxidation state. Dbv29 contains FAD covalently tethered to both His91 and Cys151, and is a four-electron oxidation catalyst, generating the C6 acid via an inter-mediate aldehyde. It is likely that the gem diol form of the aldehyde is the substrate for the second two-electron oxidation, with the two electrons removed as hydride ions (to FAD-N5) in This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Fig. 10 Steps in assembly of the pentacyclic fungal toxin cyclopiazonic acid A(a-CPA): (a) conversion of tryptophan to the tetramic acid cycloacetyl tryptophan (cAATrp) by action of a hybrid NRPS-PKS assembly line; (b) mechanistic proposal for the flavoenzyme CpaO-mediated-conversion of b-CPA to a-CPA with formation of the final two rings of the mature toxin.

The FADH2 form of the enzyme is regenerated by reduction of cosubstrate O2 to H2O2 in each turnover so that two two-electron oxidations (alcohol to aldehyde; gem diol to acid) can happen before release of product. The bound aldehyde intermediate is accessible to various nucleophilic amines diffusing in from solution. The resulting hemiaminal can either be released as the imine or the hemi-aminal can stay in the active site and be processed in the second redox step. In this case the product is the amide not the free acid (Fig. 14b). Turnover in the presence of amines thus gives access to glycopeptides with long chain amides at both the 2-amino and C6 (as carboxamides) of the glucosyl ring. It turns out that some of the bis-lipidated glycopeptides have desirable antibiotic properties. An additional \ue104avoenzyme that carries out a net four-elec-tron oxidation on a substrate, starting with a two-electron oxidation of a sugar alcohol to the ketone, is aclacinomycin (Acl) oxidase.54 Aclacinomycins are tetracyclic aromatic polyketides with antibiotic and antitumor activity. Appended to the tetra-cyclic polyketide scaffold is a trisaccharide that provides binding speci\ue103city to DNA. The initial trisaccharide chain in the late stage intermediate aclacinomycin N is rhodosamine-2-deoxyfucose-rhodinose. The terminal rhodinose is a trideoxy hexose with a single alcohol substituent. The oxidase converts this \u2013OH to the ketone, thereby generating the trideoxyketose cinerulose A (AclA; Fig. 14c). Surprisingly, the oxidase acts a second time, now not as an aldehyde oxidase but as a typical \ue104avin-dependent desaturase, generating an ole\ue103n ab to the newly introduced ketone to produce the ab-enone functionality in the terminal sugar, now L-aculose. This is aclacinomycin Y, the biosynthetic endproduct. Thus the oxidase can be viewed as This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 carrying out a hydride transfer from the rhodinose \u2013CHOH to its covalently bound FAD in the \ue103rst cycle, undergoing air reox-idation, and then in a second cycle, still with the terminal sugar, acting once more as a proton/hydride redox catalyst, but on a distinct CH2\u2013CH2 functionality rather than a CH\u2013OH group. No other examples of such a four-electron two functional group redox \ue104avoenzyme are known. A third \ue104avoprotein alcohol oxidase of note is found in pacidamycin biosynthesis.55 It is not so much the mechanism that is of interest but the substrate is uridine and the product is uridine-50-aldehyde (Fig. 15), a metabolite proposed several times as a necessary intermediate in peptidyl nucleoside anti-biotic biogenesis,56 but until recently not known. Indeed a parallel route to this aldehyde has also been reported from UMP,57 but in that case it involves an iron-based oxygenase to yield the phosphorylated form of the gem diol as a labile form of the aldehyde, re\ue104ecting the complementary routes and roles of iron enzymes and \ue104avoenzymes as redox catalysts. Inter alia the uridine aldehyde is then used for PLP-mediated C\u2013C bond formations to connect amino acid moieties to the 50-aldehydic carbon and build distinct peptidyl nucleoside scaffolds.56 4.2.2.1 A Diels\u2013Alder cyclization set up by alcohol oxidation to aldehyde. The fungus Alternaria solani, a causative agent of blight in potato and tomato, makes the polyketide solanapyrone A58 (Fig. 16) with a decalin core which has been proposed to form via a [4+2] cyclization analogous to the lovastatin scaffold construction (Fig. 5). It was presumed that a comparable PKS catalyst would be responsible for this biological Diels\u2013Alder cyclization, but instead that PKS assembly line releases the triene prosolanapyrone. The CH3 of that metabolite is converted to an alcohol, prosolanapyrone II, by an iron-based oxygenase, Nat. Prod.

At one level this seems to be a simple alcohol to aldehyde oxidase. However, the aldehyde product is now in conjugation via the pyrone ring with the isolated ole\ue103n; that is thought to have a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital now tuned to react as a dienophile with the diene for the [4+2] cyclization to create the bicyclic decalin in solanapyrone A. Thus, the sequellae to \ue104avin-mediated oxidation of alcohol to conjugated aldehyde are remarkable. Redox control sets the rearrangement of the diene and dienophile in motion. 4.2.3 THIOL OXIDATIONS. Among recently described thiol oxidases are two \ue104avoproteins involved in the late stages of assembly of the fungal epithiodiketopiperazines such as glio-toxin and also the dithiolopyrrolone antibiotic holomycin from Streptomyces clavuligerus (Fig. 17). The gliotoxin dithiol oxidase GliT59,60 is the last enzyme in toxin assembly and has recently 184 | Nat. Prod. Rep., 2013, 30, 175\u2013200 been shown to play a self-protective role in the producer Aspergillus fumigatus, validating that the disul\ue103de is a prodrug and that it is the reduced dithiol form that is the problem metabolite. Analogously, conversion of the enedithiol in reduced holomycin to the bicyclic disul\ue103de at the end of the biosynthetic pathway is self-protective to S. clavuligerus.61 A related \ue104avoprotein oxidase62 functions analogously in genera-tion of the macrocyclic disul\ue103de form of the HDAC inhibitor FK228 (Fig. 17). It is likely that the thiol forms are the proximal active metabolites for mixed disul\ue103de interchange and/or redox cycling to generate reactive oxygen species in target cells and these dithiol to disul\ue103de \ue104avoenzymes are protective to the producers. A distinct variant of thiol-oxidizing \ue104avoproteins involve thiol oxidation of a cysteine moiety to create the thioaldehyde as an electron sink b to the carboxylate to set up a low energy decarboxylation path and create the enethiol tautomer of a vinylcysteamine63 (Fig. 18a). In the case of pantotheinoyl-cysteine decarboxylase64,65 in coenzyme A biosynthesis, the thi-oaldehyde is re-reduced by the FADH2 to generate the cyste-amine terminus that persists in the \ue103nal coenzyme A structure. In the case of posttranslational processing of the C-terminal cysteines in lantipeptide maturation, the Z-enethiol product can undergo Michael reactions with dehydroalanyl residues else-where in the preprotein to yield the crosslinked aminovinyl Cys residue (Fig. 18b).63 A homolog of this \ue104avoenzyme class is also found in the holomycin cluster66 where it is proposed to perform a similar oxidative decarboxylation function on a Cys-Cys-dipeptide scaffold. In fact, the conversion of a Cys-Cys dipeptidyl moiety to holomycin is a formal eight-electron oxidation; there are four \ue104avoproteins encoded in the holomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (including the dithiol oxidase HmlI noted above) sug-gesting \ue104avin redox chemical versatility is employed in each of the four two-electron oxidations on the way to the mature bicyclic ene-disul\ue103de framework of this antibiotic (Fig. 18c). 4.3 N5 of Flavin as a site of covalent adduct formation during catalytic turnover As noted in the next section, the many dozens of \ue104avoenzymes known to oxidize NAD(P)H in the reductive half reaction transfer a hydride to N5 of the \ue104avin, emphasizing this end of the double imine moiety of N5-C4a-C1a-N1 as electrophilic in oxidized \ue104avins. Two cases where carbon nucleophiles (carb-anion equivalents) are shown/proposed to add covalently to N5 of the oxidized \ue104avin coenzymes are nitroalkane oxidase and acyldihydroxyacetone-P synthase. The nitroalkane oxidase from the fungus Fusarium oxy-sporum forms an N5-covalent adduct with substrate in the \ue104avin reductive half reaction.67\u201369 This enzyme oxidizes nitroalkanes in the presence of O2 to aldehydes and H2O2 with concomitant elimination of nitrite anion (Fig. 19). Catalysis starts with abstraction of one of the Ca-H hydrogens of the bound nitro-alkane substrate as a proton because the resultant carbanion can be stabilized by delocalization into the nitro group. The carbanion then adds to N5 of FAD to yield the N5-adduct with This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Fig. 12 Oxidative dimerization of two tryptophans to indolocarbazole scaffolds: (a) action of RebO and RebD to generate chromopyrrolic acid: (b) action of RebP and RebC to make the final C\u2013C bond in the indolocarbazole scaffold and control the redox state in the oxopyrrole ring.

The lone pair of elec-trons on N5 in this adduct, available because N5 is now in the electron rich dihydro redox state, act in neighboring group assistance to expel the nitrite anion. The resulting adduct to the \ue104avin is an N5-iminium dihydro\ue104avin. Hydrolysis via water addition yields the aldehyde and FADH2, which can be reoxi-dized to FAD by cosubstrate O2. The iminium adduct can be trapped by cyanide ion to yield the stable inactive covalent \ue104avin adduct.68 This mechanism is precedent for N5 adducts to This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 substrate during turnover, the presence of N5 product imines on pathway, and the role of the N5 lone pair as internal nucleophile. A second \ue104avoenzyme proposed to function via an iminium adduct of a dihydro\ue104avin coenzyme to substrate during the catalytic cycle is alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase70 which converts some fraction of the diacylglycerol phospho-lipids in cell membranes to the monoacyl, monoalkyl ether P lipids (Fig. 20). This is a net replacement of a long chain fatty acid substituent by a long chain fatty alcohol. The catalytic cycle is proposed to start with oxidized FAD tightly bound in the active site and the removal of the diacylglycerol phospholipid (acyl DHAP) substrate hydrogen at C1 as a proton. Addition of the resultant carbanion to N5 yields the initial adduct. Partici-pation of the N5 lone pair, just as in the nitroalkane oxidase adduct, breaks the ester bond, expelling the RCOOH product and giving an N5-\ue104avin iminium adduct. This can be attacked by the oxygen of the fatty alcohol substrate once it has diffused into the active site and replaced the departed RCOOH. The resultant adduct is a carbinolamine and reoxidation of the \ue104avin with C\u2013N bond cleavage (Fig. 20) would generate a product carba-nionic transition state that needs to be reprotonated to drive the release of the alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate product (alkyl DHAP). 4.4 NADPH Oxidizing \ue104avoenzymes Most of the NADPH-oxidizing \ue104avoenzymes found in biosyn-thetic pathways are involved in co-substrate oxygenation reac-tions.

Many of the \ue104avopro-teins discussed above, with focus on their reductive half reac-tions, are reoxidized by this route and so function as oxidases.

It is known that a tetracyclic species (e.g. premithramycin B) is precursor to the mature tricyclic framework of mithramycin DK. Cleavage of the cyclohexadione ring in the tetracyclic scaffold is accomplished by an FAD-dependent Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxygenase. Oxidative insertion generates the seven membered ketolactone. Hydrolytic opening and equilibration with the carboxylate now uncovers a b-keto acid grouping. Facile decarboxylation completes the fragmentation and is one keto reductive step away from the mithramycin end product. Thus, the biological Baeyer\u2013 Villiger chemistry is used to set up a carbocyclic ring for an oxygen insertion, hydrolysis, decarboxylation sequence to open the tet-racyclic scaffold regioselectively. An even more remarkable cascade of carbon-carbon bond cleavages occur in the maturation of the rubromycin group of planar aromatic polyketides into the twisted spiroketal frame-work found for example in griseorhodin A89 (Fig. 24c). An angular hexacyclic aromatic polyketide intermediate undergoes oxidation to a quinone, rearrangement to a six-six ring spi-roketal, and then contraction to a \ue103ve-six ring spiroketal. Four C\u2013C bonds are cleaved during the multistep process. At least one and possibly two of the enzymes involved are \ue104avoproteins and both may act as Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxygen insertion catalysts. An FAD-dependent Baeyer\u2013Villiger ketone to lactone ring expansion is also implicated in oxygenative tailoring of the C15 farnesyl scaffold in generation of the sesquiterpene epox-ylactone pentalenolactone.90 This metabolite is produced by many Streptomyces strains and kills cells by capture of the reactive active site Cys thiolate of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydro-genase. Amidst several maturative oxygenative transformations enacted by iron enzymes, a \ue104avoenzyme oxygenase is proposed to convert the indicated tricyclic ketoacid to pentalenolactone D (Fig. 24d). Surprisingly, when the homologous enzyme was puri\ue103ed from S. avermitilis it carried out a Baeyer\u2013Villiger ring expansion but with oxygen insertion on the other side of the ketone to give neopentalenolactone D. This is noncanonical since the more electron rich C\u2013C bond generally migrates as the Criegee-type tetrahedral adduct breaks down in chemical and other enzymatic Baeyer\u2013Villiger insertions.91 It may be that steric crowding dictates formation of the alternate lactone regioisomer in this case. 5.3 Flavoprotein epoxidases Oxygen transfer to a C]C double bond to create an epoxide is usually thought of as the province of P450 type heme iron monooxygenases.78 However, a famous precedent that a \ue104avo-protein can carry out such epoxidations is the enzyme squalene epoxidase92 which epoxidizes one of the terminal double bonds in the C30 hexaene squalene to create squalene-2,3-oxide (Fig. 25a) which is then the substrate for the electrocyclization that simultaneously forms the tetracyclic framework of sterols.93 Styrene epoxidation and hypothemycin epoxidations are like-wise catalyzed by \ue104avoenzymes94 where delivery of the terminal \u2013OH of Fl-4a-OOH as electrophilic oxygen to the p-electrons of the ole\ue103n is the proposed polarity for oxygen transfer.

View Article OnlineA recent example of another \ue104avoenzyme with comparable epoxidase activity stems from study of the earlier steps in the fungal fumiquinazoline biosynthetic pathway. The FAD-enzyme Af1206095 acts on fumiquinazoline F (FQF) in the presence of cosubstrates NADPH and O2 to generate an unstable oxygenated intermediate that is then processed by an alanine-activating NRPSmodule Af12050 to produce fumiquinazoline A (FQA). The net result of action by these two enzymes is an annulation of the indole by the incoming alanine to produce a tricyclic imidazo-lindolone moiety, with a hydroxyl substituent at what had been the b-carbon of the indole (Fig. 25b). Af12060 is proposed to start the process by transfer of an oxygen atom across the double bond in the pyrrole ring of the indole. This can be formulated as transfer of an \u201cOH+\u201d equivalent from the FAD-4a-OOH to the electron rich Cb of the indole acting as nucleophile. The resultant product may be a hybrid between the epoxyindole and the hydroxyiminium contributor. This is the species that can be captured by the alanyl-thioester installed on the carrier protein domain of Af12060.

Rep., 2013, 30, 175\u2013200 A related family of tremorgenic fungal peptidyl alkaloids appear to be assembled by this indole epoxidation/annulation strategy.96 The Af12060 enzyme represents the \ue103rst example of a characterized \ue104avin-dependent \u201cindole epoxidase\u201dcatalyst. Paired with Af12070 noted above52 as the amine/amide oxidase converting FQA to heptacyclic FQC, the two \ue104avoenzymes in the short (four enzymes total) fumiquinazoline biosynthetic pathway illustrate how FAD redox chemistry can be utilized in biological framing of complex scaffolds. Analogously, NotB in the notoamide pathway is proposed to generate an indole epoxide intermediate from notoamide A (Fig. 25c). Two fates are proposed. One involves intramolecular conversion to the hydroxyiminium species with subsequent capture by the amide of the diketopiperazine moiety to produce notoamide D. The alternative alkoxyiminium tautomer could be quenched by intramolecular migration of the prenyl group on the way to notoamide C.97 The last epoxidase example (Fig. 25d) occurs in the lasalocid pathway where Lsd18 acts twice in succession to in C.

View Article Onlinerut genes.100 Two of the required proteins are an NADH/FMN reductase, RutF, and a partner protein, RutA, which can use the provided FMNH2, generate the FMN-4a-OOH, and use that to cleave uracil to Z-3-ureidoacrylate.101 This pair is representative of a subgroup of \ue104avin-utilizing enzymes split into two part-ners.17 The NAD(P)H-FMN reductases generate FMNH2 by typical hydride transfer but are unusual in allowing rapid release of the dihydro\ue104avin from the reductase active site. Now the FMNH2 must diffuse to the active site of the partner protein which captures it by one-electron redox manifold with O2 to yield the FMN-4a-OOH when the speci\ue103c oxygen transfer work of the partner protein begins. The FMNH2 while diffusing between the partner proteins is running an autoxidation gauntlet in solution and in principle represents an inefficient way to get dihydro\ue104avin equivalents to the oxygenative active site. In a formal sense the unraveling of uracil by this two enzyme partnership is a hydrolytic cleavage of the N3-C4 amide bond. However, the reaction path is not hydrolytic but instead oxida-tive. The proposal is that the FMN-4a-OOH acts as nucleophile towards the uracil C4-carbonyl (akin to the reactivity in the Baeyer\u2013Villiger reactions above) to yield a tetrahedral adduct.101 Expulsion of N3 from this adduct cleaves the N3-C4 amide bond and leaves a \ue104avin-acrylate perester. Reoxidation to FMN would release the peracid form of the product. An as yet uncharac-terized reduction of the ureidoacrylate peracid to the acid product would complete the reaction. The authors note chem-ical precedent for oxidative cleavage of amide bonds but this is This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 the \ue103rst documented biological example. It is a testimony to the utility of the Fl-4a-OOH for nucleophilic oxidative chemistry. 5.5 Using \ue104avin-4a-OOH to create an electrophilic biological chlorinating agent More than 4000 natural products are known that contain carbon\u2013halogen bonds, the great majority being carbon\u2013chlo-rine bonds, generated during biosynthetic processes.102 The enzymatic machinery utilized for such halogenations is matched to the electronic demands of substrate. Three distinct types of cofactors are employed by halogenases103,104 acting in biosynthetic pathways: (1) vanadium in haloperoxidases; (2) nonheme mononuclear iron in a-ketoglutarate-dependent hal-ogenases; and (3) \ue104avin coenzymes. The vanadium and iron-dependent halogenases are beyond the scope of this discussion but there are recent reviews delineating structures, mecha-nisms, and types of carbon centers that are halogenated by such catalysts.103,104 The \ue104avin dependent halogenases can be thought of as variants of \ue104avin hydroxylases. The substrate range is compa-rable to \ue104avin-mediated hydroxylations.103 Electron rich phenols, pyrroles, and indoles incorporate one or more halo-gens regiospeci\ue103cally and suggest, as in the case of transfer of an electrophilic \u201cOH+\u201d by the oxygenases, that an electrophilic \u201cCl+\u201d equivalent is generated and transferred in the active site of the \ue104avin-dependent halogenases (Fig. 27a). Typically these are two component enzyme systems:105 an FMN/FAD reductase uses NAD(P)H to generate the FlH2 which diffuses away from the reductase and to the active site of the apo form of the halo-genase (analogy to RutF and RutA above). The FlH2 then reacts with O2 in the halogenase active site in two one-electron steps to generate the canonical Fl-4a-OOH. Now chloride ion is a cosubstrate, bound between two tryptophan side chains in the active site106,107 and attacks the distal oxygen of the \ue104avin peroxide, cleaving the weak O\u2013O bond, leaving the Fl-4a-OH and generating hypochlorous acid, HOCl, as the nascent product. This constitutes transfer of \u201cOH+\u201d to the attacking ClNone, in keeping with the polarity of the Fl-OOH.103 Intriguingly, once that has happened, the chlorine in HOCl is instead a \u201cCl+\u201d equivalent, consistent with the subsequent reactivity towards electron rich phenols and pyrroles in the substrates that get chlorinated. There is indirect evidence in the tryptophan 7-halogenase that starts rebeccamycin biosynthesis (vide supra) that the nascent HOCl, in diffusing down an active site tunnel to get to the bound tryptophan substrate, encounters the 3-NH2 of a Lys side chain conserved in these dihydro\ue104avin-dependent halo-genases.108 Thus, formation of a Lys-NH-Cl chloramine inter-mediate may occur and be the proximal chlorinating agent, still polarized to deliver a \u201cCl+\u201d equivalent, as shown in Fig. 27a for regiospeci\ue103c chlorination at C7 of the indole side chain. In biosynthesis of the hexadepsipeptide antifungal agent kutz-neride109 there are a pair of FlH2-dependent halogenases that act in tandem to generate the 7-Cl-Trp and then the 6,7-dichloro-Trp residue that gets incorporated into the hexadep-sipeptide antifungal kutzneride scaffold.110 Analogously, a Nat.

ClmS is proposed to act on acetyl CoA converting it to dichloroacetyl CoA as the proximal acylating reagent in the pathway (Fig. 27c). Utilization of acetyl CoA as halogenation substrate would allow the readily acces-sible thioester enolate to act as a nucleophile towards the ClmS chloramine intermediates as a donor of \u201cCl+\u201d. 5.6 Biological oxidative Favorskii rearrangement during enterocin assembly The bacteriostatic agent enterocin is an octaketide from Strep-tomyces maritimus that has undergone extensive rearrangement during biosynthetic maturation. The EncM \ue104avoenzyme appears to be the major change agent, acting on a polyketidyl-S-ACP substrate that has undergone prior reduction of one of the eight ketones to the C9-OH.113 This kind of regiospeci\ue103c reduction of one speci\ue103c ketone in a polyketonic chain is typical as a set point for determining cyclization connectivity in tetra-cyclic aromatic polyketides.114 In this system, that \u2013OH group becomes a crucial internal nucleophile during the EncM-mediated scaffold rearrangements (Fig. 28). It is thought115 that EncM has monooxygenase activity, with the Fl-4a-OOH trans-ferring an \u201cOH+\u201d equivalent to an enolate to yield a hydroxy C12 species, sandwiched between the C11 and C13 ketones. Further oxidation of that alcohol (a second hydroxylation to the gem diol, or an alcohol to ketone type of dehydrogenation) is proposed to yield the 11,12,13 triketo intermediate. 194 | Nat. Prod. Rep., 2013, 30, 175\u2013200 Now a Favorskii-type rearrangement116 is envisioned. In the thioester enolate tautomer C14 is nucleophilic and could attack the C12 keto to yield a hydroxycyclopropanone species. In turn this could then be captured by the C9-OH as nucleophile attacking the strained C13 carbonyl within the cyclopropanone. Lactone formation would be coupled to C13\u2013C14 bond cleavage. This alters the backbone chain connectivity and sets the central hydroxy-keto-lactone framework in enterocin. This interme-diate, while still bound in the EncM active site, could then undergo two directed aldol condensations (C6\u2013C11 and C7\u2013C13 in the pre-enterocin framework) to construct the remaining two six membered rings of the enterocin tricyclic core. Presumably the folded acyclic polyketidyl chain conformer that is stabilized in the EncM active site is crucial not only for the original oxygenation/oxidation to yield the triketo intermediate, but also to enable the proposed Favorskii rearrangement and the subsequent double aldol condensations. The cascade of chemistry that is unleashed a\ue09der the \ue104avin coenzyme-mediated redox steps is reminiscent of the post-redox cycliza-tion to the decalin framework in the solanapyrone synthase active site.58 5.7 Morphing FMN into dimethylbenzimidazole: A \ue104avin \u201cdestructase\u201d Vitamin B12 binds a redox active cobalt atom in the equatorial plane of the tetrapyrrolic corrin macrocycle.

B12 is produced only by microbes and so is essential for humans. The last piece of B12 biosynthesis to be uncovered was the mechanism of formation of the dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) bicyclic ring system. It had been known for years that FMN is the precursor for DMB and that C10 of the ribityl chain of FMN becomes the C2 of the imidazole moiety of DMN, but the responsible enzyme, BluB, has only recently been identi\ue103ed in a DMB auxotroph of Sinorhizobium meliloti.117 BluB turns out to be the \ue104avin \u201cdestructase\u201d, cleaving the ribityl chain between C10 and C20 to release erythrose-40-phosphate and to contract the tricyclic isoalloxazine to the bicyclic DMB (Fig. 29b). In keeping with the theme of two component \ue104avoenzymes noted in previous sections (e.g. the halogenases and the Rut enzymes), a separate NADH-dependent reductase generates FMNH2 which diffuses to the active site of BluB that then reacts FMNH2 with O2. The mechanism of BluB as \ue104avin \u201cdestructase\u201d has not been resolved but it is reasonable to postulate the canonical FMN-4a-OOH as an early intermediate.118 It is possible that this undergoes an intramolecular Baeyer\u2013Villiger type oxygen insertion into its pyrimidine ring to yield the 7-member lactone (Fig. 29c). This sets up that ring for a series of hydrolytic steps that would take apart both the ring-expanded pyrimidine and the central pyrazine: loss of oxalic acid, urea, and CO2 could generate the indicated dia-minobenzene. Oxidation and retroaldol cleavage would precede cyclization and aromatizing oxidation to dimethylbenzimidazole. The examples in this Section 5 deal with the different reaction manifolds open to Fl-4a-OOH intermediates and the control of their reactivity in enzyme microenvironments. The utilization of \ue104avin hydroperoxides, as both electrophilic and nucleophilic oxygenation reagents on a diverse range of cosubstrates to effect some remarkable chemical transformations, explains the many crossroads of natural product tailoring and maturation occupied by \ue104avoenzymes. This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 6 Nucleophilic and general base catalysis for FlH2 in flavoenzymes In Section 5 we focused on the one-electron manifold of reduced \ue104avins and the two step reactions that lead to the covalent Fl-4a-OOH intermediate. The other well known 4a adducts in \ue104a-voenzyme chemistry are the Fl-4a-thiol adducts that form during the catalytic cycles of dithiol oxidases/disul\ue103de reductases such as the well studied glutathione reductase,119 lipoamide dehydro-genase,120 mercuric ion reductases,121,122 and plant photo-tropins.123 All of these FAD enzymes in their resting state have an active site disul\ue103de proximal to the bound \ue104avin coenzyme isoalloxazine ring system. Once the FADH2 has been generated in the reductive half reaction, the reoxidative half reaction involves adduct formation in a two-electron manifold with C4a of the dihydroFMN/FAD acting as nucleophile (Fig. 3). The 4a-thiol-\ue104avin adduct is then subjected to the indicated participation of the second thiol to regenerate the resting oxidation state of this enzyme subclass, with FAD and active site disul\ue103de reformed. N5 of Flavins is the other port of entry and exit of electrons as repeatedly noted above in the transfer of hydride ions to and from nicotinamide coenzymes as substrates and also in the covalent adducts formed during nitroalkane oxidation and alkyl ether phospholipid biosynthesis. Recent evidence has accrued that N5 in FADH2 and FMNH2 can also act as a general acid/base catalyst for proton transfer, without reoxidation or net change in the FlH2 oxidation state. 6.1 N5 of FMNH2 as a proton transfer catalyst The case for FlH2 as a proton transfer catalyst has beenmade for the enzyme IDI-2,124 catalyzing the interconversion of D2-and D3-isopentenyl diphosphates (Fig. 30), generating the pool of isomers needed for all isoprenoid pathways.

The enzyme converts the predominant form of galactose (gal), the pyranose cyclic hemiacetal (galp), to the minor furanose hemiketal (galf; Fig. 31).

Two of the virtues of interconversion of galp and galf starting and ending at the nucleotide diphosphosugar level are that (a) UDP is a good leaving group to lower the energy barrier for attack by N5 of FADH2 and (b) then the product has the galf activated at C10 for subsequent galactosyl transfer and oligomerization. This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 7 Concluding remarks Flavin coenzymes are immensely versatile heterocycles that enable many kinds of chemical transformations as complexity is built into biosynthetic scaffolds. The tricyclic isoalloxazine with its fused pyrazine-pyrimidine rings can access more diverse reaction manifolds than any other organic or metal-centered coenzyme. This includes both two-and one-electron transfer pathways that position \ue104avins at all the metabolic redox crossroads where \ue104ux steps down from two-electron only (e.g. NAD(P)H) to one-electron only (e.g. FeIII) redox partners. Flavins are responsive to cosubstrate demands, as exempli\ue103ed by their ability to participate in transfer of hydrogens with two electrons (HNone), one electron (H_), or no electrons (H+). FAD and FMN are electrophilic in the oxidized state and nucleophilic in the reduced state. Both N5 and bridgehead C4a are ports of entry and exit of electrons, as evidenced by covalent adducts at those positions to substrates. The oxygen reactivity in the FlH2 reoxidative half reaction via one-electron transfer and radical recombination to the Fl-4a-OOH opens up biosynthetically useful sets of oxygen transfers. While transfer of an electrophilic \u201cOH+\u201d equivalent to nucleo-philic cosubstrates is the predominant oxygen transfer mode, the behavior of the Fl-4a-peroxyanion as nucleophile towards electrophilic centers in cosubstrates is the basis of Baeyer\u2013Vil-liger oxygenative ring expansions of ketones to lactones and conversions of aldehydes to esters. The discovery of a large class of \ue104avoenzymes with halogenase activity highlights the ability of the Fl-OOH intermediates to transfer \u201cOH+\u201d to chloride anions and thereby generate \u201cCl+\u201d equivalents as nascent HOCl and then likely enzyme-chloramines as proximal chlorinating agents. Flavoenzymes are key complexity-generating enzymes in natural product maturations, setting up [4+2] cyclizations by distinct routes in lovastatin and solanapyrone assembly. They are active, virtuoso catalysts in the creation of tricyclic and then heptacyclic peptide alkaloid scaffolds in fumiquinazolines C and D, of the pentacyclic and heptacyclic scaffolds in chromo-pyrrolic acid and the subsequent indolocarbazole frameworks of rebeccamycin and staurosporine. They engineer oxygenative opening of tetracyclic precursors in angucycline maturation. EncM catalyzes a four-ring circus with a Favorskii rearrange-ment at the heart of enterocin assembly. The UDP-gal mutase mediates a remarkable ring contraction in producing galf monomers for mycobacterial cell wall assembly. The bis-nitrogen heterocyclic portion of the isoalloxazine core in the \ue104avin coenzymes is without peer in the scope of biological redox catalysis enabling control of framework archi-tecture and functional group disposition of a huge range of natural products. As more microbial genome sequences turn up predicted \ue104avoprotein orfs in biosynthetic gene clusters, addi-tional new biosynthetic chemistry is likely to emerge. 8 Acknowledgements Work in theWalsh laboratory has been supported by NIH grants GM20011 and GM49338.

The one-electron reactivity of both the FlH2 and FlH_oxidation states is the key determinant in allowing these enzyme-coenzyme systems to react with O2, in contrast to air-stable NAD(P)H coenzymes.7,11 Covalent adducts form in some \ue104avoenzyme-mediated transformations between sites on the isoalloxazine ring of the coenzyme and a reacting center of the substrate. In particular N5 is a site of hydride addition for Flox and a site of hydride ejection from FlH2 in the reverse direction.12 N5 is also the site of covalent addition by substrate carbanions.13 In parallel, the bridgehead C4a position is the site of covalent connection with thiols14 and also with radical oxygen species, such as superoxide equivalents to yield 4a-peroxides (Fig. 3).9 We will note the double-headed reactivity of the Fl-4a-OOH intermediates in speci\ue103c cases below.

Substrates with acid groupings (free acids or, more easily, thioesters) are desaturated to the conjugated carbonyl products (e.g. succinate to fumarate). These typically start with removal of one of the prochiral methylene hydrogens from Ca as a proton.

Depending on the nature of the heteroatom, reaction manifolds can be viewed as involving (a) H+ and substrate carbanion, (b) H_ and C_ radicals, or (c) HNone and a carbonium ion like transition state, within this large substrate class, with hydride transfer as the most common mechanism. The third group encompasses oxidation of dithiols to disul\ue103des, typically involving Fl-4a-thiol adducts as schematized in Fig. 3. The last major group involves a large family of \ue104avoenzymes oxidizing NADPH to NADP, by hydride transfer from the reduced nicotinamide coenzymes to N5 of the bound FAD.",

These could involve formal reversal of the \ue103rst half reactions. One such fate, in the second half reaction, is a net transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH or NADH.

        "OnlineFumarate reductases in anaerobic bacteria create succinate as the end product as they dump electrons from their respiratory chains. Glutathione reductases spend NADPH to generate bound FlH2, which in turn drives the reduction of the oxidized inter-molecular disul\ue103de form of glutathione back to the thiol-con-taining tripeptide (GSH) to high levels of that thiol in cells. The one-electron manifold is seen in such enzymes as succinate dehydrogenases, which during reoxidation of FlH2 transfer one electron at a time to iron-sulfur clusters, in a separate domain (three in succinate dehydrogenase before electron transfer to a membrane soluble quinone). Of particular interest for \ue104avoenzyme transformations in biosynthetic pathways is the one-electron reoxidation manifold for reaction with O2. This is formulated as one-electron transfer from FlH2 to yield superoxide anion (one-electron reduced dioxygen, pKa \u00bc 4.8)) and the \ue104avin semiquinone, FlH_ (Fig. 4b), followed by radical recombination at the bridgehead C4a to yield the 4a-\ue104avin hydroperoxide.9,17 We will note four distinct fates for this peroxide in speci\ue103c examples below.",

This is a monooxygenase outcome. We will note two additional variant fates for the Fl-4a-OOH: conversion to an HOCl equivalent in halogenase active sites for substrate halogenation; and behavior of the peroxy-\ue104avin as a nucleophilic equivalent in Baeyer\u2013Villigerase trans-formations.

This process is also central to the harvesting of energy in fatty acyl CoA b-oxidations. The reverse, saturation of the ab-enoyl-S-carrier proteins by FAD-containing enoyl-ACP reductases, is the physiologic mechanism for adding hydrogens and electrons to be stored in the long methylene chains of saturated fatty acyl-S-ACP during fatty acid biosynthesis. These enoyl reductases are important catalysts in both fatty acid and polyketide scaffold constructions. Acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) are 8\u201310 kDa proteins where a speci\ue103c serine side chain has been post-translationally modi\ue103ed with the phosphopantetheine moiety from coenzyme A to provide a reactive thiol arm on which to assemble and grow the acyl chains.18,19",

However, in the fungal type I PKS enzyme LovB in lova-statin assembly, the ER domain within the LovB protein is inactive.20 Instead, a separate protein LovC21 is an enoyl reductase that acts in trans to reduce the conjugated enoyl group only at the tetraketide, pentaketide, and heptaketide stages (Fig. 5), but not at the diketide, triketide or hexaketide stages of chain elongation.

IndC has four predicted functional domains, C-A-Ox-T. The N-terminal condensation domain (C) seems incomplete and likely inactive. The adenylation (A) domain activates glutamine and tethers it on the phosphopantetheinyl thiolate arm of the holo form of the thiolation (T) domain.24 The oxidase (Ox) domain is analogous to several \ue104avoprotein domains noted in the next section that oxidize thiazolines to thiazoles,26,27 and so has been proposed to be a \ue104avin-dependent desaturase, converting Cb-and CgNoneCH2 groups to the conjugated ole\ue103n.",

The thiazoline and oxazo-line rings can persist, as they do in some of the nonribosomal peptide cases where these dihydroheterocycles form part of the ligand set for tight binding to FeIII in siderophores, e.g. in yer-siniabactin and vibriobactin (Fig. 7b) which act as bacterial and fungal virulence factors.28",

Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is an Aspergillus metabolite that acts as a vertebrate toxin because of nanomolar affinity to the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase.40 This pentacyclic indole tetramic acid scaffold is assembled in a short efficient three enzyme pathway by the producing fungi. The CpaS enzyme is a hybrid PKS-NRPS that uses malonyl CoA and tryptophan to form and release the tetramic acid cyclo-acetoa-cetyl-Trp (Fig. 10a).41 CpaD is a regioselective prenyl transferase that installs the dimethylallyl group at C4 of the indole ring of the CpaS product to yield b-CPA.42 The third and last enzyme in the pathway is CpaO, with a covalently bound FAD,43 which converts b-CPA to a-CPA, in the process creating the middle two -6-5-rings in the \ue103nal 6-5-6-5-5 pentacyclic scaffold. Although the mechanism of CpaO is not fully determined, one can propose a variant of the typical desaturase pathway for the transformation (Fig. 10b).",

For our biosynthetic purposes these reductive half reactions are not particularly noteworthy mech-anistically but we describe examples in natural product contexts where subsequent transformations of note are thereby enabled. 4.2.1 AMINE OXIDATIONS. There are a variety of natural products that contain pyrrole moieties that arise from the readily available amino acid proline.44 These include the pyrrole moieties in prodigiosin and pyrrolomycin and in the antibiotics clorobiocin, coumermycin, and kibdelomycin (Fig. 11a).45 The origin of these pyrrole heterocycles thus differs from the ami-nolevulinate pathway leading to porphobilinogen and ulti-mately the tetrapyrrole macrocycles in the porphyrins, corrins, and chlorophyll frameworks. The conversion of proline to pyrrole carboxylate occurs while the proline is tethered in thioester to the pantetheinyl thiol arm on NRPS modules,46 in some analogy to the logic discussed in the previous sections. Proline is selected by an adenylation domain, activated as prolyl-AMP and captured by the thiol of the pantetheinyl prosthetic group of a holo T domain to yield the prolyl-S-protein (Fig. 11b). Now a free standing FAD-linked dehydrogenase converts the prolyl-S-PCP to a two electron oxidized product. This undergoes further two electron oxidation to the pyrrolyl-S-carrier protein in a process that may re\ue104ect uncatalyzed oxidative aromatization to the pyrrole.

The FADH2 form of the enzyme is regenerated by reduction of cosubstrate O2 to H2O2 in each turnover so that two two-electron oxidations (alcohol to aldehyde; gem diol to acid) can happen before release of product. The bound aldehyde intermediate is accessible to various nucleophilic amines diffusing in from solution. The resulting hemiaminal can either be released as the imine or the hemi-aminal can stay in the active site and be processed in the second redox step. In this case the product is the amide not the free acid (Fig. 14b). Turnover in the presence of amines thus gives access to glycopeptides with long chain amides at both the 2-amino and C6 (as carboxamides) of the glucosyl ring.

The FAD-enzyme Af1206095 acts on fumiquinazoline F (FQF) in the presence of cosubstrates NADPH and O2 to generate an unstable oxygenated intermediate that is then processed by an alanine-activating NRPSmodule Af12050 to produce fumiquinazoline A (FQA). The net result of action by these two enzymes is an annulation of the indole by the incoming alanine to produce a tricyclic imidazo-lindolone moiety, with a hydroxyl substituent at what had been the b-carbon of the indole (Fig. 25b). Af12060 is proposed to start the process by transfer of an oxygen atom across the double bond in the pyrrole ring of the indole. This can be formulated as transfer of an \u201cOH+\u201d equivalent from the FAD-4a-OOH to the electron rich Cb of the indole acting as nucleophile.

Now the FMNH2 must diffuse to the active site of the partner protein which captures it by one-electron redox manifold with O2 to yield the FMN-4a-OOH when the speci\ue103c oxygen transfer work of the partner protein begins. The FMNH2 while diffusing between the partner proteins is running an autoxidation gauntlet in solution and in principle represents an inefficient way to get dihydro\ue104avin equivalents to the oxygenative active site. In a formal sense the unraveling of uracil by this two enzyme partnership is a hydrolytic cleavage of the N3-C4 amide bond. However, the reaction path is not hydrolytic but instead oxida-tive. The proposal is that the FMN-4a-OOH acts as nucleophile towards the uracil C4-carbonyl (akin to the reactivity in the Baeyer\u2013Villiger reactions above) to yield a tetrahedral adduct.101 Expulsion of N3 from this adduct cleaves the N3-C4 amide bond and leaves a \ue104avin-acrylate perester.

Three distinct types of cofactors are employed by halogenases103,104 acting in biosynthetic pathways: (1) vanadium in haloperoxidases; (2) nonheme mononuclear iron in a-ketoglutarate-dependent hal-ogenases; and (3) \ue104avin coenzymes. The vanadium and iron-dependent halogenases are beyond the scope of this discussion but there are recent reviews delineating structures, mecha-nisms, and types of carbon centers that are halogenated by such catalysts.103,104",

The substrate range is compa-rable to \ue104avin-mediated hydroxylations.103 Electron rich phenols, pyrroles, and indoles incorporate one or more halo-gens regiospeci\ue103cally and suggest, as in the case of transfer of an electrophilic \u201cOH+\u201d by the oxygenases, that an electrophilic \u201cCl+\u201d equivalent is generated and transferred in the active site of the \ue104avin-dependent halogenases (Fig. 27a). Typically these are two component enzyme systems:105 an FMN/FAD reductase uses NAD(P)H to generate the FlH2 which diffuses away from the reductase and to the active site of the apo form of the halo-genase (analogy to RutF and RutA above). The FlH2 then reacts with O2 in the halogenase active site in two one-electron steps to generate the canonical Fl-4a-OOH. Now chloride ion is a cosubstrate, bound between two tryptophan side chains in the active site106,107 and attacks the distal oxygen of the \ue104avin peroxide, cleaving the weak O\u2013O bond, leaving the Fl-4a-OH and generating hypochlorous acid, HOCl, as the nascent product. This constitutes transfer of \u201cOH+\u201d to the attacking ClNone, in keeping with the polarity of the Fl-OOH.103 Intriguingly, once that has happened, the chlorine in HOCl is instead a \u201cCl+\u201d equivalent, consistent with the subsequent reactivity towards electron rich phenols and pyrroles in the substrates that get chlorinated.",
        "There is indirect evidence in the tryptophan 7-halogenase that starts rebeccamycin biosynthesis (vide supra) that the nascent HOCl, in diffusing down an active site tunnel to get to the bound tryptophan substrate, encounters the 3-NH2 of a Lys side chain conserved in these dihydro\ue104avin-dependent halo-genases.108 Thus, formation of a Lys-NH-Cl chloramine inter-mediate may occur and be the proximal chlorinating agent, still polarized to deliver a \u201cCl+\u201d equivalent, as shown in Fig. 27a for regiospeci\ue103c chlorination at C7 of the indole side chain.

Presumably the folded acyclic polyketidyl chain conformer that is stabilized in the EncM active site is crucial not only for the original oxygenation/oxidation to yield the triketo intermediate, but also to enable the proposed Favorskii rearrangement and the subsequent double aldol condensations.

The last piece of B12 biosynthesis to be uncovered was the mechanism of formation of the dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) bicyclic ring system. It had been known for years that FMN is the precursor for DMB and that C10 of the ribityl chain of FMN becomes the C2 of the imidazole moiety of DMN, but the responsible enzyme, BluB, has only recently been identi\ue103ed in a DMB auxotroph of Sinorhizobium meliloti.117 BluB turns out to be the \ue104avin \u201cdestructase\u201d, cleaving the ribityl chain between C10 and C20 to release erythrose-40-phosphate and to contract the tricyclic isoalloxazine to the bicyclic DMB (Fig. 29b). In keeping with the theme of two component \ue104avoenzymes noted in previous sections (e.g. the halogenases and the Rut enzymes), a separate NADH-dependent reductase generates FMNH2 which diffuses to the active site of BluB that then reacts FMNH2 with O2. The mechanism of BluB as \ue104avin \u201cdestructase\u201d has not been resolved but it is reasonable to postulate the canonical FMN-4a-OOH as an early intermediate.118 It is possible that this undergoes an intramolecular Baeyer\u2013Villiger type oxygen insertion into its pyrimidine ring to yield the 7-member lactone (Fig. 29c). This sets up that ring for a series of hydrolytic steps that would take apart both the ring-expanded pyrimidine and the central pyrazine: loss of oxalic acid, urea, and CO2 could generate the indicated dia-minobenzene. Oxidation and retroaldol cleavage would precede cyclization and aromatizing oxidation to dimethylbenzimidazole. The examples in this Section 5 deal with the different reaction manifolds open to Fl-4a-OOH intermediates and the control of their reactivity in enzyme microenvironments. The utilization of \ue104avin hydroperoxides, as both electrophilic and nucleophilic oxygenation reagents on a diverse range of cosubstrates to effect some remarkable chemical transformations, explains the many crossroads of natural product tailoring and maturation occupied by \ue104avoenzymes.",

        "6 Nucleophilic and general base catalysis for FlH2 in flavoenzymes In Section 5 we focused on the one-electron manifold of reduced \ue104avins and the two step reactions that lead to the covalent Fl-4a-OOH intermediate. The other well known 4a adducts in \ue104a-voenzyme chemistry are the Fl-4a-thiol adducts that form during the catalytic cycles of dithiol oxidases/disul\ue103de reductases such as the well studied glutathione reductase,119 lipoamide dehydro-genase,120 mercuric ion reductases,121,122 and plant photo-tropins.123 All of these FAD enzymes in their resting state have an active site disul\ue103de proximal to the bound \ue104avin coenzyme isoalloxazine ring system. Once the FADH2 has been generated in the reductive half reaction, the reoxidative half reaction involves adduct formation in a two-electron manifold with C4a of the dihydroFMN/FAD acting as nucleophile (Fig. 3). The 4a-thiol-\ue104avin adduct is then subjected to the indicated participation of the second thiol to regenerate the resting oxidation state of this enzyme subclass, with FAD and active site disul\ue103de reformed.",

Now, recapture of the galactosyl group by the UDP initially expelled at the start of the cycle, but still held in the enzyme active site, will generate the product UDP-galf. Two of the virtues of interconversion of galp and galf starting and ending at the nucleotide diphosphosugar level are that (a) UDP is a good leaving group to lower the energy barrier for attack by N5 of FADH2 and (b) then the product has the galf activated at C10 for subsequent galactosyl transfer and oligomerization.",

        "7 Concluding remarks Flavin coenzymes are immensely versatile heterocycles that enable many kinds of chemical transformations as complexity is built into biosynthetic scaffolds. The tricyclic isoalloxazine with its fused pyrazine-pyrimidine rings can access more diverse reaction manifolds than any other organic or metal-centered coenzyme. This includes both two-and one-electron transfer pathways that position \ue104avins at all the metabolic redox crossroads where \ue104ux steps down from two-electron only (e.g. NAD(P)H) to one-electron only (e.g. FeIII) redox partners. Flavins are responsive to cosubstrate demands, as exempli\ue103ed by their ability to participate in transfer of hydrogens with two electrons (HNone), one electron (H_), or no electrons (H+). FAD and FMN are electrophilic in the oxidized state and nucleophilic in the reduced state. Both N5 and bridgehead C4a are ports of entry and exit of electrons, as evidenced by covalent adducts at those positions to substrates.",
        "The oxygen reactivity in the FlH2 reoxidative half reaction via one-electron transfer and radical recombination to the Fl-4a-OOH opens up biosynthetically useful sets of oxygen transfers. While transfer of an electrophilic \u201cOH+\u201d equivalent to nucleo-philic cosubstrates is the predominant oxygen transfer mode, the behavior of the Fl-4a-peroxyanion as nucleophile towards electrophilic centers in cosubstrates is the basis of Baeyer\u2013Vil-liger oxygenative ring expansions of ketones to lactones and conversions of aldehydes to esters. The discovery of a large class of \ue104avoenzymes with halogenase activity highlights the ability of the Fl-OOH intermediates to transfer \u201cOH+\u201d to chloride anions and thereby generate \u201cCl+\u201d equivalents as nascent HOCl and then likely enzyme-chloramines as proximal chlorinating agents.",
