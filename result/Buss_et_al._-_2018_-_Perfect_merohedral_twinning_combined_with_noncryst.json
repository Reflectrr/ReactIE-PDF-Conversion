New halogenases with novel substrate specificities will add to the toolbox of enzymes available to organic chemists. HalX, the product of the xcc-b100_4193 gene, is a putative flavin-dependent halogenase from Xanthomonas campestris. The enzyme was recombinantly expressed and crystallized in order to aid in identifying its hitherto unknown substrate. Native data collected to a resolution of 2.5 A\u030a showed indications of merohedral twinning in a hexagonal lattice. Attempts to solve the phase problem by molecular replacement failed. Here, a detailed analysis of the suspected twinning is presented. It is most likely that the crystals are trigonal (point group 3) and exhibit perfect hemihedral twinning so that they appear to be hexagonal (point group 6). As there are several molecules in the asymmetric unit, noncrystallographic symmetry may complicate twinning analysis and structure determination. 1. Introduction Enzymatic halogenation by flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs) has several advantages over chemical halogenation (Weichold et al., 2016). It proceeds under mild conditions, requiring only FADH2, O2 and harmless halide salts such as NaCl or NaBr as substrates, and it occurs with high regio-selectivity that cannot easily be achieved otherwise. This makes FDHs attractive tools for organic chemists in the transition from classical processes to green chemistry (Latham et al., 2018). However, there are also drawbacks that limit the use of FDHs in biocatalysis, such as low enzyme activity and poor long-term stability. Nevertheless, regioselective chlorin-ation of tryptophan has already been successful on the gram scale using cross-linked enzyme aggregates (Frese & Sewald, 2015). The crystal structures of the tryptophan halogenases PrnA (Dong et al., 2005), RebH (Yeh et al., 2007; Bitto et al., 2008) and PyrH (Zhu et al., 2009) have greatly advanced our understanding of the reaction mechanism and the regioselec-tivity. To broaden the scope of FDHs as biocatalysts, enzymes accepting substrates other than tryptophan are required (Latham et al., 2018). Some FDHs, such as CndH (Bueden-bender et al., 2009), PltA (Pang et al., 2015), Bmp2 and Mpy16 (El Gamal et al., 2016), are part of multi-enzyme systems. They ISSN 2053-230X # 2018 International Union of Crystallography belong to the so-called variant B FDHs that accept their substrate only if bound to a carrier protein, which limits their general applicability. More recently, several halogenases accepting free substrates other than tryptophan have been identified (Zeng & Zhan, 2010; Menon et al., 2017; Fraley et al., 2017). Some of these have a broader substrate spectrum than other FDHs. Novel FDHs can be identified from genomes or metagenomes by sequence analysis as they contain conserved signature sequences (Zehner et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2017). We annotated the xcc-b100_4193 gene from Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris strain B100 (Vorho\u0308lter et al., 2008; Alkhateeb et al., 2017) as a putative FDH and called the resulting protein HalX owing to its origin from Xanthomonas and its unknown substrate. In HalX the conserved sequences GxGxxG and WxWxIP are 12GGGLAG17 and 237WFWLIP242, respectively. Sequence alignment also showed that a lysine residue (Lys79) is present in HalX at the position where the catalytically essential lysine residue is invariantly located in other FDHs. HalX has 21 and 22% sequence identity to the prototypic tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA and RebH, respectively. In the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the FDH CmlS is the protein with the highest sequence identity to HalX (Podzelinska et al., 2010). We assume that the putative FDH HalX is an active enzyme and accepts as yet unidentified substrates that most likely differ from tryptophan. HalX may thus be a welcome addition to the biocatalysis toolbox. To aid in identifying the substrate of HalX, we set out to crystallize the protein for structure determination by X-ray crystallo-graphy. Here, we describe the expression, purification and crystallization of HalX. Unexpectedly, structure solution by molecular replacement failed. We attribute this to suspected perfect merohedral twinning in combination with non-crystallographic symmetry. The indications of twinning are discussed in detail. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Macromolecule production The sequence coding for HalX was subcloned from a pET-28a expression vector with a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal His6 tag into the expression vector pETM-11 (Gunter Stier, EMBL Heidelberg) using the primers listed in Table 1. The resulting fusion protein has an N-terminal His6 tag followed by the recognition sequence for Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Table 1). HalX was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells. The bacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in LB medium with 30 mg l None1 kanamycin and 34 mg lNone1 chloramphenicol at 310 K. The cultures were shifted to 293 K, induced with 100 mM isopropyl None-d-1-thiogalacto-pyranoside and incubated with shaking (90 rev minNone1; IFS-1-V Ku\u0308hner) overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifuga-tion. After resuspension in 15 ml lysis buffer [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche) and 400 mg DNaseI (Macherey-Nagel)] per litre of bacterial culture, the cells were lysed in an SPCH ultrahigh-pressure cell homogenizer (Stansted Fluid Power) for three to five cycles at a pressure of approximately 120 MPa. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (60 min, 30 000g). All chromatographic steps were performed at 277 K. The supernatant was applied onto 15 ml PureCube Ni\u2013NTA agarose (Cube Biotech) equili-brated with PBS. The matrix was washed three times with 20 ml of each of the following buffers: (i) PBS pH 8.0 plus an additional 300 mM NaCl, (ii) 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, (iii) 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole. Immediately after elution with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, EDTA was added to the protein-containing fractions to a final concentration of 5 mM. HalX was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a self-packed Source Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0. HalX was eluted with a gradient of 0\u2013 40% high-salt buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl) over 20 column volumes. The N-terminal His6 tag was removed by TEV protease cleavage (HalX:TEV mass ratio of 50:1) at 277 K overnight. Uncleaved HalX and His-tagged TEV protease were removed by binding to 15 ml Ni\u2013NTA agarose at 277 K for 60 min. The flowthrough was collected, concentrated with research communications 346 Buss et al. None HalX from Xanthomonas campestris Acta Cryst. (2018).

The amino-acid sequence of HalX used in this publication is based on predictions published in 2008 (Vorho\u0308lter et al., 2008). The exact same amino-acid sequence is predicted in many other X. campestris pv. campestris strains. A refined annotation of the complete genome of X. campestris pv. campestris strain B100 based on RNA-sequencing data now predicts a HalX protein that is eight amino acids shorter at the N-terminus (Alkhateeb et al., 2017). This refined sequence, which is currently accessible in the public database, would require the codon GTG coding for Val9 in our sequence to act as a start codon. an ultrafiltration device (Vivaspin, molecular-weight cutoff 10 kDa; Sartorius) and applied onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 prep-grade column (GE Healthcare) equili-brated with 12.5 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 125 mM NaCl. The protein was concentrated to 24 mg mlNone1 by ultrafiltration as above and stored in small aliquots at 253 K. The protein concentration was determined using absorption measure-ments with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (PEQLAB) at a wavelength of 280 nm and the theoretical molar extinction coefficient of HalX as calculated by the ProtParam tool on the ExPASy server (Gasteiger et al., 2005). The yield of purified protein from 1 l of bacterial culture was 15 mg. 2.2. Crystallization For crystallization, the frozen protein stock was diluted in 12.5 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 125 mM NaCl and supplemented with 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM iodoacetamide to suppress the nonspecific proteolysis that was observed upon prolonged storage at 293 K in the absence of protease inhibitors. Crystal screening was performed in MRC 2-well plates (Swissci) using commercial screens and a Crystal Gryphon robot (Art Robbins) with drop sizes of 100 nl protein solution and 100 nl reservoir solution or 100 nl protein solution and 200 nl reservoir solution. Crystal optimization with larger drops took place in MRC 2-well plates or Cryschem M 24-well sitting-drop plates. The final crystallization conditions are listed in Table 2. 2.3. Data collection and processing For cryoprotection, we initially used a solution containing sodium potassium phosphate and ammonium sulfate at the same concentrations as in the reservoir solution plus an additional 25% glycerol. Later, we switched to reservoir solution plus 40% xylitol, which somewhat reduced the problem of the rapid formation of phosphate crystals during the mounting procedure (Table 2). Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Fine-sliced data were collected at 100 K on various beamlines at the ESRF using pixel-array detectors (Dectris). Data were indexed and integrated with XDS and scaled with XSCALE (Kabsch, 2010). Twinning was analysed with phenix.xtriage (Adams et al., 2010). Molecular replace-ment was attempted with Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) run through the CCP4i interface (Winn et al., 2011) and the MorDa automatic molecular-replacement pipeline that relies on the program MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Protein production and crystallization HalX was recombinantly expressed as a His6-tagged protein and was purified by Ni\u2013NTA affinity chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration, from which it eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular weight consistent with that of a monomer. The protein appeared as a single band on Coomassie-stained gels, but showed degrada-tion upon prolonged storage at 293 K. This nonspecific proteolysis could be suppressed by the addition of 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM iodoacetamide. Initial crystals grew as small needles at 293 K with a protein concentration of 10 mg mlNone1 in conditions A12 and B1 of the commercial screen The MbClass Suite (Qiagen) and condition B1 of The MbClass II Suite (Qiagen). All conditions contained 1 M sodium potassium phosphate and 0.1 M ammonium phosphate or ammonium sulfate at pH values of 7.5\u20138.5. The crystallization conditions were further refined to those described in Table 2. Crystal growth varied greatly and somewhat erratically between neighbouring conditions in finely sampled two-dimensional grid screens of pH (steps of 0.1) versus precipitant concen-tration (steps of 10 mM sodium potassium phosphate).

The left crystal shows the cross-section looking down the long axis of a needle. example, in one 24-well grid screen sampling pH from 6.9 to 7.4 against sodium potassium phosphate concentration from 690 to 720 mM there were drops with no crystals, drops with many small needles and drops with one or a few thick hexa-gonal needles reaching up to 900 None 60 mm in size (Fig. 1). Occasionally these thick needles appeared to be single crys-tals, but often their ends suggested that they were actually made up of many aligned thin hexagonal needles. The large crystals were yellowish, most likely owing to the presence of the cofactor FAD. 3.2. Space-group determination and twinning analysis The data for crystal 1, which grew under conditions similar to the initial screening hits, scaled equally well in point groups 3 and 6 but considerably worse in point group 622 (Table 3). Systematic absences suggested space groups P31, P32, P62 or P64. Matthews probability analysis suggested six and three molecules per asymmetric unit in points groups 3 and 6, respectively, with a Matthews coefficient of 2.43 A\u030a3 DaNone1 and a solvent content of 49%. There was no indication of pseudo-translation, with the largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function being around 3% of the height of the origin peak. The twin indicators in phenix.xtriage hinted towards twinning, although not perfect twinning (Table 4). One possibility for the true point group could be 6 with twin operator (h, Noneh None k, Nonel), emulating point group 622. However, the twin-law-dependent twin fraction calculated for this operator by phenix.xtriage was very low (Table 4; Britton None 0.04, H None 0.06, ML None 0.02). Alternatively, the true point group might be 3 with twinning around a twofold axis along the crystallographic threefold axis [twin law (Noneh, Nonek, l)]. The scaling statistics suggest that twinning around this operator would be (almost) perfect, with a twin fraction close to 0.5, as the Rmeas for point group 3 and point group 6 is virtually identical (Table 3). However, the twin-law-independent twin indicators calculated by phenix.xtriage deviate from the values expected for a perfect twin (Table 4). The twin-law-dependent calculation of the twin fraction for operator (Noneh, Nonek, l) yielded values of between 0.44 and 0.48, suggesting almost perfect twinning (Table 4). As we were unable to solve the structure by molecular replacement (see below), we collected data from a further 13 crystals, hoping to find a less twinned specimen. This set comprised crystals grown under conditions similar to those for crystal 1 and under conditions similar to those for crystal 2 (Table 2). Since the twin fraction sometimes varies within a crystal (Keller, 2017), we collected several complete data sets at different positions along the long axis of the large needles of a couple of crystals. All crystals but one behaved very similarly to crystal 1. Generally, scaling in point group 6 increased the hIi/hNone(I)i over that from scaling in point group 3, without any significant increase in Rmeas. Only one crystal (crystal 2 in Tables 2 and 3), which was grown at a higher protein concentration and lower precipitant concentration than crystal 1 and that was block-shaped rather than needle-shaped, showed a different behaviour, with a decreased hIi/hNone(I)i and a doubling of Rmeas in P6x compared with P3x. This strongly suggested that twinning occurred around a twofold axis along the crystallographic threefold axis [operator (Noneh, Nonek, l)], which would be consistent with the crystal morphology described above. Although the twin fraction calculated for this particular twin law was lower for crystal 2 (between 0.25 and 0.32; Table 3) than for crystal 1, the twin-law-independent twin indicators were closer to the values expected for a perfect twin for crystal 2 than for crystal 1 (Table 3). The correlation between the data sets of crystals 1 and 2 in point group 3 (Table 3) reported by XSCALE was 0.997. Interestingly, a second data set collected from a different position of crystal 2 showed scaling behaviour similar to that of all of the other 13 crystals, with a higher hIi/hNone(I)i and no significant increase of Rmeas in P6x compared with scaling in P3x.

Attempts to solve the structure The structures of several other FDHs have been solved by molecular replacement despite low sequence identity with the respective search models (Pang et al., 2015; El Gamal et al., 2016). In the case of MibH this approach allowed the location of four chains in the asymmetric unit (Ortega et al., 2017). For molecular replacement in Phaser, we created an ensemble of superposed search models based on the four best hits found by HHpred (Alva et al., 2016), namely MalA (PDB entry 5wgx; Fraley et al., 2017), CndH (PDB entry 3e1t; Buedenbender et al., 2009), Bmp2 (PDB entry 5bva; El Gamal et al., 2016) and PltA (PDB entry 5dbj; Pang et al., 2015). Flexible loops and regions that show a high divergence in secondary-structure elements were deleted manually in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010). A very similar approach had previously allowed us to solve the phase problem for crystals of an None/None-hydrolase with less than 20% sequence identity to any known structure and three molecules in the asymmetric unit (Thoms et al., 2011). For HalX, we tried molecular replacement in various possible space groups. We put particular effort into solving the struc-ture in P31 and P32. The Phaser run took several days, indi-cating major problems in solving the structure. We also ran the automated molecular-replacement pipeline MorDa in space groups P3, P31 and P32. We did not obtain a promising solu-tion that refined to reasonable R factors or allowed further model building using either Phaser or MorDa. 4. Conclusion Molecular replacement is more difficult for twinned crystals, and it is especially tricky with low-homology search models (Zwart et al., 2008). Trying to find a crystal even less twinned than crystal 2 is not a viable option, as 13 of the 14 crystals that were tested showed (almost) perfect twinning at all positions from which we collected data. Only one of two data sets collected from crystal 2 showed a lower twin fraction, esti-mated at between 0.25 and 0.32 (Table 4). Even with this lower twin fraction, molecular replacement failed. Thus, structure solution will have to await the availability of better search models or the generation of another crystal form that does not suffer from twinning. As an alternative, we are pursuing the production of selenomethionine (SeMet)-labelled protein for use in anomalous diffraction experiments. Phasing by multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) or single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) is more difficult with twinned crystals (McCoy & Read, 2010). Nevertheless, MAD phasing worked for hemihedrally twinned crystals with twin fractions of about 0.36\u20130.4 without detwinning the data (Yang et al., 2000; Rudolph et al., 2003). SAD phasing was even possible from model data that were artificially perfectly twinned (Dauter, 2003). For the two crystals that are described here, the twin-law-independent twin indicators do not seem to behave as expected. Scaling statistics suggest that crystal 1 is (almost) perfectly twinned, while crystal 2 must have a lower twin fraction. Still, the twin-law-independent twin indicators of crystal 2 are closer to the values expected for a perfect twin than those of crystal 1. This unexpected behaviour could be owing to the presence of rotational noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) elements parallel to the twin axis (Lebedev et al., 2006). As the asymmetric unit in point group 3 is most likely to contain six molecules, the presence of a non-crystallographic twofold, threefold or even sixfold axis parallel to the crystallographic threefold axis and the twin axis seem possible or even likely. Rotational NCS is often present in crystals that exhibit merohedral twinning (Lebedev et al., 2006). Rotational NCS has been shown to result in an underestimation of the twin fraction by twin-law-independent twin indicators because it relates reflection intensities that are assumed to be unrelated (Lebedev et al., 2006). The presence or absence of rotational NCS parallel to the crystallographic threefold axis and the suspected twofold twin axis cannot be established from the self-rotation function, as the NCS axis would be masked by the crystallographic threefold axis and the twin operator. Finally, if the true point group is 3, not only hemihedral but also tetartohedral twinning with four twin domains instead of only two will be possible (Roversi et al., 2012). The determination of the true space group, the kind of twinning present and the actual twin fractions will have to await structure solution and refinement.

        "Flavin-dependent halogenases can be used as biocatalysts because they regioselectively halogenate their substrates under mild reaction conditions. New halogenases with novel substrate specificities will add to the toolbox of enzymes available to organic chemists. HalX, the product of the xcc-b100_4193 gene, is a putative flavin-dependent halogenase from Xanthomonas campestris. The enzyme was recombinantly expressed and crystallized in order to aid in identifying its hitherto unknown substrate. Native data collected to a resolution of 2.5 A\u030a showed indications of merohedral twinning in a hexagonal lattice. Attempts to solve the phase problem by molecular replacement failed. Here, a detailed analysis of the suspected twinning is presented. It is most likely that the crystals are trigonal (point group 3) and exhibit perfect hemihedral twinning so that they appear to be hexagonal (point group 6). As there are several molecules in the asymmetric unit, noncrystallographic symmetry may complicate twinning analysis and structure determination.",
        "1. Introduction Enzymatic halogenation by flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs) has several advantages over chemical halogenation (Weichold et al., 2016). It proceeds under mild conditions, requiring only FADH2, O2 and harmless halide salts such as NaCl or NaBr as substrates, and it occurs with high regio-selectivity that cannot easily be achieved otherwise. This makes FDHs attractive tools for organic chemists in the transition from classical processes to green chemistry (Latham et al., 2018). However, there are also drawbacks that limit the use of FDHs in biocatalysis, such as low enzyme activity and poor long-term stability. Nevertheless, regioselective chlorin-ation of tryptophan has already been successful on the gram scale using cross-linked enzyme aggregates (Frese & Sewald, 2015). The crystal structures of the tryptophan halogenases PrnA (Dong et al., 2005), RebH (Yeh et al., 2007; Bitto et al., 2008) and PyrH (Zhu et al., 2009) have greatly advanced our understanding of the reaction mechanism and the regioselec-tivity. To broaden the scope of FDHs as biocatalysts, enzymes accepting substrates other than tryptophan are required (Latham et al., 2018). Some FDHs, such as CndH (Bueden-bender et al., 2009), PltA (Pang et al., 2015), Bmp2 and Mpy16 (El Gamal et al., 2016), are part of multi-enzyme systems. They",

        "belong to the so-called variant B FDHs that accept their substrate only if bound to a carrier protein, which limits their general applicability. More recently, several halogenases accepting free substrates other than tryptophan have been identified (Zeng & Zhan, 2010; Menon et al., 2017; Fraley et al., 2017). Some of these have a broader substrate spectrum than other FDHs. Novel FDHs can be identified from genomes or metagenomes by sequence analysis as they contain conserved signature sequences (Zehner et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2017).",
        "We annotated the xcc-b100_4193 gene from Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris strain B100 (Vorho\u0308lter et al., 2008; Alkhateeb et al., 2017) as a putative FDH and called the resulting protein HalX owing to its origin from Xanthomonas and its unknown substrate. In HalX the conserved sequences GxGxxG and WxWxIP are 12GGGLAG17 and 237WFWLIP242, respectively. Sequence alignment also showed that a lysine residue (Lys79) is present in HalX at the position where the catalytically essential lysine residue is invariantly located in other FDHs. HalX has 21 and 22% sequence identity to the prototypic tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA and RebH, respectively. In the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the FDH CmlS is the protein with the highest sequence identity to HalX (Podzelinska et al., 2010). We assume that the putative FDH HalX is an active enzyme and accepts as yet unidentified substrates that most likely differ from tryptophan. HalX may thus be a welcome addition to the biocatalysis toolbox. To aid in identifying the substrate of HalX, we set out to crystallize the protein for structure determination by X-ray crystallo-graphy. Here, we describe the expression, purification and crystallization of HalX. Unexpectedly, structure solution by molecular replacement failed. We attribute this to suspected perfect merohedral twinning in combination with non-crystallographic symmetry. The indications of twinning are discussed in detail.",

        "The sequence coding for HalX was subcloned from a pET-28a expression vector with a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal His6 tag into the expression vector pETM-11 (Gunter Stier, EMBL Heidelberg) using the primers listed in Table 1. The resulting fusion protein has an N-terminal His6 tag followed by the recognition sequence for Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Table 1). HalX was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells. The bacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in LB medium with 30 mg l None1 kanamycin and 34 mg lNone1 chloramphenicol at 310 K. The cultures were shifted to 293 K, induced with 100 mM isopropyl None-d-1-thiogalacto-pyranoside and incubated with shaking (90 rev minNone1; IFS-1-V Ku\u0308hner) overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifuga-tion. After resuspension in 15 ml lysis buffer [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche) and 400 mg DNaseI (Macherey-Nagel)] per litre of bacterial culture, the cells were lysed in an SPCH ultrahigh-pressure cell homogenizer (Stansted Fluid Power) for three to five cycles at a pressure of approximately 120 MPa. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (60 min, 30 000g). All chromatographic steps were performed at 277 K. The supernatant was applied onto 15 ml PureCube Ni\u2013NTA agarose (Cube Biotech) equili-brated with PBS. The matrix was washed three times with 20 ml of each of the following buffers: (i) PBS pH 8.0 plus an additional 300 mM NaCl, (ii) 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, (iii) 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole. Immediately after elution with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, EDTA was added to the protein-containing fractions to a final concentration of 5 mM. HalX was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a self-packed Source Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0. HalX was eluted with a gradient of 0\u2013 40% high-salt buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl) over 20 column volumes. The N-terminal His6 tag was removed by TEV protease cleavage (HalX:TEV mass ratio of 50:1) at 277 K overnight.

The protein appeared as a single band on Coomassie-stained gels, but showed degrada-tion upon prolonged storage at 293 K.

The large crystals were yellowish, most likely owing to the presence of the cofactor FAD.",

        "The data for crystal 1, which grew under conditions similar to the initial screening hits, scaled equally well in point groups 3 and 6 but considerably worse in point group 622 (Table 3). Systematic absences suggested space groups P31, P32, P62 or P64. Matthews probability analysis suggested six and three molecules per asymmetric unit in points groups 3 and 6, respectively, with a Matthews coefficient of 2.43 A\u030a3 DaNone1 and a solvent content of 49%. There was no indication of pseudo-translation, with the largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function being around 3% of the height of the origin peak. The twin indicators in phenix.xtriage hinted towards twinning, although not perfect twinning (Table 4). One possibility for the true point group could be 6 with twin operator (h, Noneh None k, Nonel), emulating point group 622. However, the twin-law-dependent twin fraction calculated for this operator by phenix.xtriage was very low (Table 4; Britton None 0.04, H None 0.06, ML None 0.02). Alternatively, the true point group might be 3 with twinning around a twofold axis along the crystallographic threefold axis [twin law (Noneh, Nonek, l)]. The scaling statistics suggest that twinning around this operator would be (almost) perfect, with a twin fraction close to 0.5, as the Rmeas for point group 3 and point group 6 is virtually identical (Table 3). However, the twin-law-independent twin indicators calculated by phenix.xtriage deviate from the values expected for a perfect twin (Table 4). The twin-law-dependent calculation of the twin fraction for operator (Noneh, Nonek, l) yielded values of between 0.44 and 0.48, suggesting almost perfect twinning (Table 4).",
        "As we were unable to solve the structure by molecular replacement (see below), we collected data from a further 13 crystals, hoping to find a less twinned specimen. This set comprised crystals grown under conditions similar to those for crystal 1 and under conditions similar to those for crystal 2 (Table 2). Since the twin fraction sometimes varies within a crystal (Keller, 2017), we collected several complete data sets at different positions along the long axis of the large needles of a couple of crystals. All crystals but one behaved very similarly to crystal 1. Generally, scaling in point group 6 increased the hIi/hNone(I)i over that from scaling in point group 3, without any significant increase in Rmeas. Only one crystal (crystal 2 in Tables 2 and 3), which was grown at a higher protein concentration and lower precipitant concentration than crystal 1 and that was block-shaped rather than needle-shaped, showed a different behaviour, with a decreased hIi/hNone(I)i and a doubling of Rmeas in P6x compared with P3x. This strongly suggested that twinning occurred around a twofold axis along the crystallographic threefold axis [operator (Noneh, Nonek, l)], which would be consistent with the crystal morphology described above. Although the twin fraction calculated for this particular twin law was lower for crystal 2 (between 0.25 and 0.32; Table 3) than for crystal 1, the twin-law-independent twin indicators were closer to the values expected for a perfect twin for crystal 2 than for crystal 1 (Table 3). The correlation between the data sets of crystals 1 and 2 in point group 3 (Table 3) reported by XSCALE was 0.997. Interestingly, a second data set collected from a different position of crystal 2 showed scaling behaviour similar to that of all of the other 13 crystals, with a higher hIi/hNone(I)i and no significant increase of Rmeas in P6x compared with scaling in P3x.

        "The structures of several other FDHs have been solved by molecular replacement despite low sequence identity with the respective search models (Pang et al., 2015; El Gamal et al., 2016). In the case of MibH this approach allowed the location of four chains in the asymmetric unit (Ortega et al., 2017). For molecular replacement in Phaser, we created an ensemble of superposed search models based on the four best hits found by HHpred (Alva et al., 2016), namely MalA (PDB entry 5wgx; Fraley et al., 2017), CndH (PDB entry 3e1t; Buedenbender et al., 2009), Bmp2 (PDB entry 5bva; El Gamal et al., 2016) and PltA (PDB entry 5dbj; Pang et al., 2015). Flexible loops and regions that show a high divergence in secondary-structure elements were deleted manually in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010). A very similar approach had previously allowed us to solve the phase problem for crystals of an None/None-hydrolase with less than 20% sequence identity to any known structure and three molecules in the asymmetric unit (Thoms et al., 2011). For HalX, we tried molecular replacement in various possible space groups. We put particular effort into solving the struc-ture in P31 and P32. The Phaser run took several days, indi-cating major problems in solving the structure. We also ran the automated molecular-replacement pipeline MorDa in space groups P3, P31 and P32. We did not obtain a promising solu-tion that refined to reasonable R factors or allowed further model building using either Phaser or MorDa. 4. Conclusion Molecular replacement is more difficult for twinned crystals, and it is especially tricky with low-homology search models (Zwart et al., 2008). Trying to find a crystal even less twinned than crystal 2 is not a viable option, as 13 of the 14 crystals that were tested showed (almost) perfect twinning at all positions from which we collected data. Only one of two data sets collected from crystal 2 showed a lower twin fraction, esti-mated at between 0.25 and 0.32 (Table 4). Even with this lower twin fraction, molecular replacement failed. Thus, structure solution will have to await the availability of better search models or the generation of another crystal form that does not suffer from twinning. As an alternative, we are pursuing the production of selenomethionine (SeMet)-labelled protein for use in anomalous diffraction experiments. Phasing by multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) or single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) is more difficult with twinned crystals (McCoy & Read, 2010). Nevertheless, MAD phasing worked for hemihedrally twinned crystals with twin fractions of about 0.36\u20130.4 without detwinning the data (Yang et al., 2000; Rudolph et al., 2003). SAD phasing was even possible from model data that were artificially perfectly twinned (Dauter, 2003).",
        "For the two crystals that are described here, the twin-law-independent twin indicators do not seem to behave as expected. Scaling statistics suggest that crystal 1 is (almost) perfectly twinned, while crystal 2 must have a lower twin fraction. Still, the twin-law-independent twin indicators of crystal 2 are closer to the values expected for a perfect twin than those of crystal 1. This unexpected behaviour could be owing to the presence of rotational noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) elements parallel to the twin axis (Lebedev et al., 2006). As the asymmetric unit in point group 3 is most likely to contain six molecules, the presence of a non-crystallographic twofold, threefold or even sixfold axis parallel to the crystallographic threefold axis and the twin axis seem possible or even likely. Rotational NCS is often present in crystals that exhibit merohedral twinning (Lebedev et al., 2006). Rotational NCS has been shown to result in an underestimation of the twin fraction by twin-law-independent twin indicators because it relates reflection intensities that are assumed to be unrelated (Lebedev et al., 2006). The presence or absence of rotational NCS parallel to the crystallographic threefold axis and the suspected twofold twin axis cannot be established from the self-rotation function, as the NCS axis would be masked by the crystallographic threefold axis and the twin operator. Finally, if the true point group is 3, not only hemihedral but also tetartohedral twinning with four twin domains instead of only two will be possible (Roversi et al., 2012). The determination of the true space group, the kind of twinning present and the actual twin fractions will have to await structure solution and refinement.",
