About 20% of all pharma-ceutical small molecule drugs and around 30% of all active compounds in agrochemistry are halogenated. Chemical halogenation procedures usually are characterized by the use of hazardous or even highly toxic chemicals. Recently, a biocatalytic process for L-tryptophan halogenation at the gram-scale using FAD-dependent halogenase and NADH-dependent flavin reductase enzymes has been described. Many proteinogenic amino acids are produced by fermentation using Corynebacterium glutamicum. The fermentative production of L-glutamate and L-lysine, for example, is operated at the million-ton scale. However, fermentative production of halogenated amino acids has not yet been described. In this study, fermentative production of the halogenated amino acid 7-chloro-L-tryptophan from sugars, ammonium and chloride salts was achieved. This required metabolic en-gineering of an L-tryptophan producing C. glutamicum strain for expression of the genes coding for FAD-de-pendent halogenase RebH and NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes. Chlorination of L-tryptophan to 7-chloro-L-tryptophan by recombinant C. glutamicum was improved by opti-mizing the RBS of rebH. Metabolic engineering enabled production of 7-chloro-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophan from the alternative carbon sources arabinose, glucosamine and xylose. 1. Introduction Halogenated amino acids are sought after by the pharmaceutical, chemical and agrochemical industries (Diederich and Stang, 2008). They are found in various natural products including the antibiotics chloramphenicol and pyrroindomycin, the plant growth-regulating thienodolin, and the antifungal pyrrolnitrin (Hammer et al., 1997; van P\u00e9e and H\u00f6lzer, 1999). Rebeccamycin is an indolocarbazole alkaloid antibiotic that inhibits DNA topoisomerase I and is produced naturally by Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes (Nishizawa et al., 2005; Onaka et al., 2003). 7-Chloro-L-tryptophan (7-Cl-Trp) is a precursor of rebeccamycin. Halogenation of L-tryptophan (Trp) requires two enzymes encoded in the reb cluster of L. aerocolonigenes: the FADH-dependent halogenase RebH and NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF (Nishizawa et al., 2005). Halogenase RebH uses FADH2, molecular oxygen (O2) and chloride (Cl-) to halogenate its substrate Trp yielding 7-Cl-Trp. In turn, recycling of the reduced cofactor FADH2 requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent flavin reductase RebF. Recently, a biocatalytic process for L-tryptophan halogenation at the gram-scale has been described based on the purified enzymes and cross-linked enzyme aggregates including alcohol dehydrogenase for NADH recycling with isobutanol (Frese and Sewald, 2015; Schnepel and Sewald, 2017). However, production of the halogenated amino acid 7-Cl-Trp by fer-mentation has neither been described for the native L. aerocolonigenes nor for other microorganisms. Corynebacterium glutamicum is the work horse of fermentative amino acid production (Eggeling and Bott, 2015; Hermann, 2003; Lee et al., 2016; Wendisch et al., 2016). Besides its use in the million-ton scale L-glutamate and L-lysine processes, this bacterium has been engineered for production of various compounds including alcohols (Inui et al., 2004; Jojima et al., 2015; Siebert and Wendisch, 2015; Wendisch et al., 2016), diamines (Wendisch et al., 2018) like putrescine (Schneider and Wendisch, 2010), organic acids (Wieschalka et al., 2013), terpenoids (Heider et al., 2014) such as patchoulol (Henke et al., 2018) or non-https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.12.008 Received 30 July 2018; Received in revised form 11 December 2018; Accepted 14 December 2018 \u204e Corresponding author at: Chair of Genetics of Prokaryotes, Faculty of Biology & CeBiTec, Bielefeld University, Germany.

All rights reserved.T proteinogenic amino acids (Wendisch, 2016) such as GABA (Jorge et al., 2016, 2017; Kim et al., 2013; P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2016). C. glu-tamicum has also been engineered to produce aromatic amino acids including Trp and aromatic compounds amenable from intermediates of the shikimate and chorismate pathways (Lee and Wendisch, 2017). Recently, a metabolic engineering strategy to overproduce Trp and related compounds such as 4-hydroxybenzoate has been described (Purwanto et al., 2018). Strain engineering for Trp production included plasmid-based expression of trpD from E. coli and genome-based ex-pression of trpEFBR coding for feedback-resistant anthranillate synthase, together with deletion of csm encoding chorismate mutase and ex-pression of aroGFBR encoding feedback-resistant 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase from E. coli in the vdh-deleted genome locus (Purwanto et al., 2018). Here, we describe metabolic engineering of 7-Cl-Trp producing strains based on the above described Trp producing strain (Fig. 1). Overexpression of the genes encoding the FADH-dependent halogenase RebH and the NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF from L. aero-colonigenes enabled halogenation of Trp to 7-Cl-Trp. Moreover, pro-duction of 7-Cl-Trp and Trp from the alternative carbon sources like arabinose, xylose and glucosamine that do not have competing uses for human and animal nutrition was established. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditions Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 (Hanahan, 1983) was used for cloning of 2.3.2. Determination of the specific activity of RebH The measurements were done in triplicates. The reaction mixture had a final volume of 0.5ml and contained 5mM Trp, 1 U/ml ADH from Rhodococcus sp. (s. below), 2.5 U/ml PrnF from P. fluorescens (s. below), 0.01mM FAD, 1mM NAD, 5% isopropanol, 0.005mM PMSF, 5mM Na2HPO4, 15mM NaCl and 250 \u03bcl of crude extract. It was in-cubated at 30 \u00b0C for 10min. The reaction was stopped with 187.5 \u03bcl methanol. The supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Product formation was calculated based on the peak area in comparison to a calibration curve of 7-Cl-Trp. Since we and Frese et al., 2014, observed difficulties in purification of RebF, we used the easily obtainable PrnF for this in vitro assay. 2.3.3. Cultivation of P. putida KT2440(pCIBhis-prnF) and E. coli BL21(DE3) (pET21-ADH) For the overproduction of PrnF from P. fluorescens, P. putida KT2440 was transformed with pCIBhis-prnF. For the expression, 500ml LB were inoculated with 5ml of the P. putida KT2440(pCIBhis-prnF) overnight culture. The main culture was cultivated for 1 day at 30 \u00b0C with 50 \u03bcg ml-1 tetracycline. Then the cells were spun down and stored at-20 \u00b0C. For overexpression of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), pET21-ADH was transformed in BL21(DE3). After inoculated from an overnight culture to an OD 0.1, the cells were cultivated at 37 \u00b0C to an OD of 0.6 before the temperature was lowered to 21 \u00b0C and the expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After 4 h the cells were spun down and stored at -20 \u00b0C. 2.3.4. Enzyme purification All steps during the purification were done at 4 \u00b0C. To purify the His6-tagged PrnF, P. putida cells from a 500ml LB culture were centrifuged and resuspended in TGNI5 buffer (20mM Tris, 300mM NaCl, 5% glycerin, 5 mM imidazole). To inhibit the protease activity 1mM PMSF was added. The cells were disrupted by sonication (UP 200 S, Dr. Hielscher GmbH, Teltow, Germany) on ice at an amplitude of 55% and a duty cycle of 0.5 for 4min. After centrifugation (20,200 \u00d7 g, 60min, 4 \u00b0C) the supernatant was filtered and poured in Polypropylene columns 5ml which a had bed volume of 2ml Ni-NTA Superflow from Qiagen. The column was washed twice with TNGI5 and once with TNGI20 (20mM Tris, 300mM NaCl, 5% glycerin, 20mM imidazole). The protein was eluted with TNGI buffer which contained 200mM imidazole. The protein was analyzed using a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). For the pur-ification of the ADH, a heat precipitation method was used. The cells were resuspended in 6.6 ml 10mM K2HPO4, pH 7.4, and disrupted 4min with 55% amplitude and 0.5 cycles on ice in the UP200S Ultrasonic Processor from Hielscher Ultrasound Technology. The crude extract was taken after centrifugation and heated up to 60 \u00b0C for 20min. The enzyme was stored at -20 \u00b0C. 2.3.5. Determination of the alcohol dehydrogenase activity The specific activity of the overexpressed alcohol dehydrogenase (crude extract) was determined in triplicates by monitoring an increase of absorption at \u03bb=340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH + H+ to NAD+ (\u03b5=6.3ml mmol-1 cm-1) in a final volume of 1ml. The reac-tion mixture contained 910 \u03bcl of 10 mM K2HPO4 pH 7.4, 5% iso-propanol (2-Propanol), 250 \u03bcM NAD and 20 \u03bcl of the crude extract. The cuvette was prewarmed to 30 \u00b0C with the Shimadzu UV-1800. The conversion rate of the substrate was determined by regression of the linear range.

The specific activities of the overexpressed flavin re-ductase RebF in C. glutamicum (crude extract) and the purified flavin reductase PrnF (see 2.3) were determined in triplicates by monitoring the decrease of absorption at \u03bb=340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH + H+ to NAD+ (\u03b5=6.3mmol-1 cm-1). The reaction mixture with a final volume of 1ml contained 910 \u03bcl of 10mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4 buffer), 50 \u03bcM FAD, 160 \u03bcM NADH and 20 \u03bcl of the crude extract (or the purified enzyme). The reaction mixture was prewarmed to 30 \u00b0C with the Shimadzu UV-1800. The conversion rate of the substrate was determined by regression in the linear range. 2.5. Analytical procedures For the quantification of the extracellular and intracellular trypto-phan and 7-chloro-tryptophan a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system was used (1200 series, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, B\u00f6blingen, Germany). The supernatants of the cell culture were collected by centrifugation (20,238 x g, 20min, RT) and further used for analysis. For detection of L-tryptophan and the deri-vatives, samples were derivatised with ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) (Schneider and Wendisch, 2010). The amino acid separation was per-formed by a precolumn (LiChrospher 100 RP18 EC-5 \u03bc (40mm\u00d74 mm), CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) and a column (Li-Chrospher 100 RP18 EC-5 \u03bc (125mm\u00d74mm), CS Chromatographie Service GmbH). The detection was carried out with a fluorescence detector (FLD G1321 A, 1200 series, Agilent Technologies) with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 230 nm and 450 nm, respectively. 2.6. Internal metabolites extraction For the quantification of intracellular amino acids 2ml of broth for each strain grown in minimal medium were collected at 24 h. 1ml was centrifuged for 10min at 13,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C. Pellets were treated with 5% HClO4 in an ice bath for 20min. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10min and 4 \u00b0C, the supernatant was neutralized with K2CO3 so-lution and centrifuged again at 13,000 rpm for 10min and 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was then ready for amino acid quantification or to be stored at -20 \u00b0C (Sun et al., 2016). The biomass concentration was determined according to the correlation CDW=0.353 OD (Bolten et al., 2007). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. C. glutamicum is unable to use Trp as nitrogen and carbon sources For the production of halogenated tryptophans it is beneficial if the production host cannot degrade the final product. As a first approach, it was tested if C. glutamicum can use Trp as sole nitrogen source, C. glutamicum WT was grown in CGXII minimal medium lacking urea and ammonium sulfate as nitrogen sources but containing 10 g L-1 glucose as carbon source and either 10mM Trp or 10mM nitrogen (urea+ ammonium sulfate) as nitrogen source. While C. glutamicum grew with urea+ ammonium sulfate as nitrogen source at a specific growth rate of 0.35 \u00b1 0.01 h-1, Trp did not serve as nitrogen source for growth (Fig. 2). Second, it was tested if Trp can be used as sole carbon source, C. glutamicum was grown in CGXII minimal medium with either 10mM Trp or with 10mM glucose as sole carbon source. No growth with 10mM Trp as carbon source was observed, whereas C. glutamicum grew with a specific growth rate of 0.31 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 with 10mM glucose (Fig. 2). From the experiments with Trp it was expected that 7-Cl-Trp would serve neither as a carbon nor as a nitrogen source. To test if C. glutamicum WT can metabolize 7-Cl-Trp, the WT was cultivated in the presence of 0.1 mM 7-Cl-Trp in CGXII containing 10mM nitrogen (urea+ ammonium sulfate) as nitrogen source and 10mM glucose as carbon source. C. glutamicum WT grew to a biomass concentration of 1.18 \u00b1 0.03 g/l with a growth rate of 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 h-1. Quantitation of 7-Cl-Trp in the medium supernatant revealed that comparable 7-Cl-Trp concentrations of 0.1 \u00b1 0.01mM after 0 h, 12 h and 24 h (data not shown). Thus, during growth in minimal medium C. glutamicum is un-able to metabolize 7-Cl-Trp. The inability of C. glutamicum to use Trp as sole nitrogen or carbon source is likely due to the lack of tryptophan degrading enzyme(s). E. coli, for example, is able to use tryptophan as sole carbon source by degrading tryptophan to indole, pyruvate and ammonia by tryptopha-nase (Yanofsky et al., 1991). Alternatively, tryptophan is degraded by a tryptophan oxygenase as e.g. in Bacillus megaterium. Tryptophan oxy-genase forms N-formyl-L-kynurenine from Trp, which subsequently is catabolised to acetate, succinate and ammonium (Bouknight and Sadoff, 1975). A reduction of the growth rate was observed when 0.1 mM 7-Cl-Trp was added to glucose minimal medium. Therefore, it was tested to what extent 7-Cl-Trp perturbs growth of C. glutamicum in glucose minimal medium. The presence of 0.1 mM 7-Cl-Trp reduced the maximal growth rate to 50% and in the presence of 0.5mM 7-Cl-Trp, no significant growth was observed (data not shown). Therefore, although not me-tabolized, 7-Cl-Trp inhibits growth of C. glutamicum. 3.2. Heterologous expression of halogenase and flavin reductase genes in a Trp overproducing C. glutamicum strain To enable fermentative production of 7-Cl-Trp by C. glutamicum, the genes encoding FADH-dependent halogenase RebH and NADH-depen-dent flavin reductase RebF from L. aerocolonigenes were expressed in Trp overproducing strain Tp679. Since RebH and RebF derive from the same organism and are likely co-evolved for functioning together, we chose to use RebH and RebF in our fementative approach. To confirm that both gene products were functional in the C. glutamicum host, crude extracts after growth in LB medium with 1mM IPTG were as-sayed for halogenase and flavin reductase activities. While the specific enzyme activity of the purified halogenase RebH has been reported to be 145 mU/mg at 25 \u00b0C (turnover number of 0.29 s-1) (Yeh et al., 2007), a specific enzyme activity of 0.90 \u00b1 0.01 mU/mg (turnover Fig. 2. Growth of C. glutamicum WT with Trp as sole nitrogen or carbon source. To test if Trp serves as sole nitrogen source C. glutamicum WT was grown in nitrogen source-free CGXII minimal medium and 10 g L-1 glucose as carbon source supplemented with either 10mM Trp () or 10mM nitrogen (urea and ammonium sulfate) (\u25a1). To test if Trp serves as sole carbon source C. glutamicum WT was cultured in carbon source-free CGXII minimal medium supplemented either with 10mM Trp (\u25b2) or 10mM glucose (\u0394). Optical densities are reported as means and standard deviations of triplicate cultiva-tions. K.H. Veldmann et al. Journal of Biotechnology 291 (2019) 7\u20131610 number of 0.002 \u00b1 0.0005 s-1) was measured in crude extracts of C. glutamicum. The low activity in crude extracts (about 0.6% activity of the purified enzyme) was in accordance with protein levels observed in SDS-PAGE of these crude extracts (Supplement data Fig. 1). Similarly, the specific enzyme activity of flavin reductase RebF in crude extracts (28 \u00b1 4 mU/mg; turnover number of 0.013 \u00b1 0.002 s-1) was about 1% of that observed for purified flavin reductase RebF (Yeh et al., 2005), which was in accordance with SDS-PAGE analysis of the crude extracts (Supplement data Fig. 1). For the fermentative production of 7-Cl-Trp by C. glutamicum HalT1 which expresses rebF and rebH, glucose minimal medium CgXII was tested with different chloride salts as halogen substrates for Trp chlorination. It is known that C. glutamicum withstands relatively high concentrations of sodium chloride and potassium chloride (half-max-imal growth rates at \u02dc490mM and \u02dc480mM, respectively) (Zahoor et al., 2014). Hence, low concentrations of chloride salts (potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium) added to the growth medium of C. glu-tamicum were expected to have little effect on growth. In minimal medium with 50mM NaCl C. glutamicum HalT1 showed a specific growth rate of 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 and produced 20 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 3; Table 2). With 50mM potassium chloride a specific growth rate of 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 and production of 19 \u00b1 2mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp resulted (Fig. 3; Table 2). As the minimal medium CGXII contains calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate (Eggeling and Bott, 2005), the calcium chloride was raised to 25mM and instead of magnesium sulfate 50mM magnesium chloride, respectively, were used. With 25mM CaCl2 a growth rate of 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 resulted and the strain produced 62 \u00b1 7mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 g L-1 Trp. With 25mM MgCl2 C. glutamicum HalT1 produced 54 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.3 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp with a spe-cific growth rate of 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 h-1. The negative control strain Tp679 trpD (pEKEx3) did not produce 7-Cl-Trp (data not shown) under these conditions. Since CaCl2 resulted in the highest 7-Cl-Trp titers, the fol-lowing experiments were performed with CaCl2. The improved per-formance in the presence of calcium ions currently is not understood, but tryptophan 7-halogenase was found to contain calcium in one re-port (Gribble, 2004). Taken together, fermentative production of 7-Cl-Trp by re-combinant C. glutamicum has been enabled. However, 7-Cl-Trp titers are around 50 to 100-fold lower than Trp titers produced by the same strain. 3.3. Determination of intra-and extracellular 7-Cl-Trp and Trp concentrations during 7-Cl-Trp production by C. glutamicum HalT1 One possible explanation of the finding that 7-Cl-Trp titers are around 50 to 100-fold lower than Trp titers may be inefficient export of 7-Cl-Trp out of the C. glutamicum cell. Since the genes of C. glutamicum coding for export system(s) for Trp and/or 7-Cl-Trp are unknown (Marin and Kr\u00e4mer, 2007), genetic experiments were not possible. Under the assumption that inefficient 7-Cl-Trp export resulted in low extracellular but high intracellular 7-Cl-Trp concentrations, the in-tracellular Trp and 7-Cl-Trp content and the supernatant concentrations were quantified during 7-Cl-Trp production by C. glutamicum HalT1 (Fig. 4). C. glutamicum HalT1 was cultivated in CGXII with 4% glucose and 50mM CaCl2 and grew with a specific growth rate of 0.19 \u00b1 0.01 h-1. In the stationary phase from 24 h to 72 h the biomass concentration decreased from 13.2 \u00b1 0.9 g L-1 to 7.8 \u00b1 0.5 g L-1 (Fig. 4). During this time the extracellular concentration of 7-Cl-Trp increased from 15 \u00b1 1mg L-1 to 38 \u00b1 1mg L-1 (Figs. 4 and 5). The extracellular Trp concentration was 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 after 24 h and reached a plateau of about 2 g L-1 at 36 h to 72 h. The extracellular 7-Cl-Trp concentration increased gradually from 15 \u00b1 1mg L-1 to 38 \u00b1 1mg L-1 in the period from 24 h to 72 h (Fig. 4). At all time points assayed the extracellular Trp concentration exceeded the extracellular 7-Cl-Trp concentration. For example, at 72 h, the extracellular Trp concentration (2.1 g L-1 or about 10mM) was 65-fold that of 7-Cl-Trp (38mg L-1 or about 0.16mM; Fig. 4). After 24 h no intracellular 7-Cl-Trp was detected, although extra-cellular 7-Cl-Trp was present in the supernatant (s. above; 15 \u00b1 1mg L-1). At later time points, intracellular 7-Cl-Trp concentrations of 0.34 \u00b1 0.05mg g[CDW]-1 to 0.46 \u00b1 0.05mg g[CDW]-1 were de-tected (Fig. 4). During this period, intracellular Trp concentrations ranged between 14 and 19mg g[CDW]-1) (Fig. 4). Since the C. gluta-micum cell volume has been determined at 2 \u03bcl mg[CDW]-1 (Gutmann et al., 1992), intracellular concentrations of about 34mM Trp (at 72 h) and about 1mM 7-Cl-Trp (at 72 h) were detected. Since the in-tracellular Trp and 7-Cl-Trp concentrations were about three and about six-fold higher than the respective extracellular concentrations, export of these compounds out of the C. glutamicum cell may limit production to some extent. However, as observed for the extracellular concentra-tions, the intracellular concentration of Trp was much larger (34 fold) than that of 7-Cl-Trp. Thus, the major bottleneck of 7-Cl-Trp production by C. glutamicum is inefficient halogenation of Trp. 3.4. Provision of intracellular Trp by feeding Trp or the dipeptide Ala-Trp It may be possible that biosynthetic precursors of Trp inhibit chlorination of Trp to 7-Cl-Trp. The biosynthetic precursors are likely present at increased intracellular concentrations in a Trp overproducing strain. Therefore, instead of using a Trp overproducing strain, the plasmid pEKEx3-rebH-rebF for expression of the FADH-dependent ha-logenase and the flavin reductase genes was used to transform C. glu-tamicum WT. To produce 7-Cl-Trp this strain was grown in CGXII 4% glucose with 50mM CaCl2, and 2mM Trp was added to the medium. Since import of Trp occurs via the importer AroP (Wehrmann et al., 1995), Trp was expected to be available intracellularly for halogenation to 7-Cl-Trp, while the intracellular concentrations of its precursors are not expected to be increased. C. glutamicum WT(pEKEx3-rebH-rebF) grew with a specific growth rate of 0.15 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 and produced 21 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp after 48 h. This 7-Cl-Trp concentration (about 0.1 mM) is much lower than the Trp concentration added to the medium (2mM). As an alternative, Trp was provided intracellularly by feeding the dipeptide L-alanyl-L-tryptophan (Ala-Trp). Dipeptides like Ala-Trp are taken up actively into the C. glutamicum cell by peptide transport sys-tems before they are hydrolyzed by peptide hydrolases (Tr\u00f6tschel et al., Fig. 3. Influence of various chloride salts on the production of 7-Cl-Trp and Trp by C. glutamicum HalT1. Strain HalT1 was grown in CGXII minimal medium with 40 g L-1 glucose and the indicated chloride salt concentrations. Means and standard deviations of three replicate cultivations are shown. K.H. Veldmann et al. Journal of Biotechnology 291 (2019) 7\u20131611 2005). Whereas alanine is catabolized fast by C. glutamicum (Tr\u00f6tschel et al., 2005), Trp is not (s. above, Trp is neither a carbon nor a nitrogen source for growth of C. glutamicum). When C. glutamicum WT(pEKEx3-rebH-rebF) was cultivated in CGXII 4% glucose with 1mM Ala-Trp and 50mM CaCl2, it grew with a specific growth rate of 0.15 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 to a biomass concentration of 14.4 \u00b1 0.5 g L-1 at 48 h (Fig. 5). After 4 h, about 1mM (256 \u00b1 9mg L-1) Ala-Trp remained in the supernatant Table 2 Growth parameters, production yields and volumetric productivities of C. glutamicum HalT1 in the presence of different chloride salts.

Journal of Biotechnology 291 (2019) 7\u20131612 while its intracellular concentration was about 27mM (14 \u00b1 1mg g [CDW]-1). At 4 h, the intra-and extracellular Trp concentrations were 7mM (3 \u00b1 1mg g[CDW]-1) and about 0.14mM (27 \u00b1 2mg L-1), re-spectively, while 7-Cl-Trp was neither detected intracellularly nor in the supernatant (Fig. 5). As expected from the kinetics of dipeptide uptake and hydrolysis (Tr\u00f6tschel et al., 2005), Ala-Trp was completely utilized at 48 h since it could neither be detected intra-nor extra-cellularly. At 48 h, the intracellular concentrations of Trp and 7-Cl-Trp were very low (below 0.5 mM). 7-Cl-Trp was produced (34 \u00b1 1mg L-1; 0.14mM) and its concentration exceeded that of extracellular Trp (9 \u00b1 1mg L-1; 0.04mM). Taken together, the low titers of 7-Cl-Trp that resulted upon addi-tion of Trp or Ala-Trp do not support the notion that biosynthetic precursors of Trp inhibit its chlorination to 7-Cl-Trp. 3.5. Optimization of the 7-Cl-Trp production To test if expression of the halogenase and flavin reductase genes is limiting production of 7-Cl-Trp, two expression vectors differing by their origins of replication and copy numbers were compared. In ad-dition, the influence of altering the ribosome binding site (RBS) to support a higher translation initiation rate of rebH was tested. The synthetic rebH-rebF present in pEKEx3-rebH-rebF was cloned into pECXT99 A (Kirchner and Tauch, 2003) (Table 1). The sequence of the RBS of rebH was optimized using RBS calculator (https://salislab.net/ software/). Based on this optimized RBS, the vectors pEKEx3-op-timRBS-rebH-rebF and pECXT99A-optimRBS-rebH-rebF were con-structed. Vectors pECXT99A-rebH-rebF and pECXT99A-optimRBS-rebH-rebF were used to transform Tp679 (pCES208-trpD). The resulting strains were HalT3 and HalT4, respectively. (Table 1). The strain HalT3 was cultivated in CGXII 4% glucose and had a specific growth rate of 0.17 \u00b1 0.004 h-1. HalT3 produced 42 \u00b1 2mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.3 \u00b1 0.2 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 6). This was similar to HalT1 which produced 57 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp with a specific growth rate of 0.11 \u00b1 0.01 h-1. A second option to improve the production of 7-Cl-Trp was to op-timize the RBS. The genes rebH and rebF were cloned with the opti-mized RBS in the pECXT99 A vector and transformed Tp679 (pCES208-trpD). The build strain HalT4 was grown in CGXII with 4% glucose and 50mM CaCl2. The specific growth rate was 0.16 \u00b1 0.006 h-1, and 66 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.3 \u00b1 0.02 g L-1 Trp were accumulated. An increase of 7-Cl-Trp production by 56% could be observed between HalT3 and HalT4 which arrived from the optimized RBS. Thus, the RBS in combination with the pEKEx3 vector (Stansen et al., 2005), which is the expression vector of HalT1, was optimized as well. The plasmid pEKEx3-optimRBS-rebH-rebF was transformed in Tp679 (pCES208-trpD). The resulting strain HalT2 was cultivated in CGXII with 4% glucose and 50mM CaCl2. HalT2 reached a specific growth rate of 0.11 \u00b1 0.004 h-1 and a production of 108 \u00b1 2mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp was measured (Fig. 6). Hence, there is an im-provement in production of 7-Cl-Trp of 56% from HalT1 to HalT2. The production of Trp decreased by 48% from HalT1 to HalT2. But 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 of the precursor anthranilate (Ant) were detected in HalT2. This can be caused through an inhibitory effect of halogenated compounds on TrpD (Fig. 1). It is known that halogenated Ant is a competitive inhibitor of PqsA, the initial enzyme of 4-hydroxy-2-al-kylquinolines biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that halo-genated Ant competitively inhibits Ant converting TrpD (Lesic et al., 2007). Until now, it is not known if 7-Cl-Trp inhibits TrpD or other enzymes of the Trp pathway in C. glutamicum. The intracellular con-centration of the cofactor FAD may be limiting although the in-tracellular concentrations of FAD or FMN are about 4.5mM OD610-1 and 2mM OD610-1, respectively (Toyoda et al., 2014). The addition of 2mM FMN to the cultivation medium improved 7-Cl-Trp production by about two fold (62 \u00b1 7mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp for HalT1 with 50mM CaCl2, 4% glucose without added FMN as compared to 130 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp when 2mM FMN were added, Fig. 3 and data not shown). How-ever, the addition of FMN is too costly for fermentative production. Our results clearly show that despite sufficient provision of Trp by the re-combinant C. glutamicum strains, halogenation proceeds to much lower concentrations as compared to Trp production (Figs. 3 and 4). Likewise, classical biocatalytic halogenation stops at a distinct conversion (Schnepel and Sewald, 2017). For example, Frese et al. (2014) as well as Payne et al. (2013) converted Trp at concentrations of only 0.5mM, which led to almost complete conversion. Up-scaling required to in-crease the volume while maintaining the low substrate concentration, e.g. Payne et al. 2013 converted 100mg Trp in a volume of 12 l (Payne et al., 2013). Although operated at the gram scale, bromination of Trp using CLEAs also had to be operated at a low concentration (i.e. 1 g Trp in 5 l; Frese and Sewald, 2015). Possible limitations may be product inhibition of the halogenase, insufficient supply of oxygen and/or redox cofactors. Thus, chlorination of Trp in solution using purified enzymes or preparations such as CLEAs currently is restricted to conversion of few milligrams of substrate (Frese and Sewald, 2015). Fermentation as described here may similarly be limited by product inhibition of the halogenase enzyme, thus, enzyme engineering to overcome such lim-itation would benefit both biocatalytic and fermentative processes. The expression of rebH and rebF of the strains HalT1 to HalT4 was shown by SDS-PAGE (Supplement Fig. 1). Strain HalT2, which accumulated the highest concentration of 7-Cl-Trp, showed the highest expression of the rebH gene. Thus, future strain development may target further rebH overexpression. It may also be important to balance the concentrations of the involved enzymes RebH and RebF. This may be done e.g. by varying translation initiation rates by changing the sequence and/or position of the ribosome binding sites (Henke et al., 2016). Alter-natively, fusion proteins of RebH and RebF may show better perfor-mance (Payne et al., 2013). Higher FAD concentrations within the cell Fig. 6. Product titers and growth parameters of various C. glutamicum strains. The C. glutamicum strains HalT1, HalT2, HalT3 and HalT4 were grown in CGXII with 4% glucose, 50mM CaCl2 and were induced with 1mM IPTG. Means and standard deviations of triplicate cultivations are given for titers of 7-Cl-Trp, Trp, and anthranilate (Ant) (A) and for biomass concentrations and specific growth rates (B). K.H. Veldmann et al. Journal of Biotechnology 291 (2019) 7\u20131613 may be reached by deletion of rshA (Toyoda et al., 2014) or by over-expression of ribF (Taniguchi and Wendisch, 2015). Redox cofactor recycling may be improved by oxygen-deprivation conditions as shown for L-alanine production by recombinant C. glutamicum (Jojima et al., 2010). It may be important to identify the transport system for 7-Cl-Trp export. In the case of fermentative L-lysine production, the L-lysine export gene lysE was overexpressed in L-lysine producing strains (Unthan et al., 2015). Unfortunately, currently the Trp export system of C. glutamicum is unknown (it may also be relevant for 7-Cl-Trp export) (P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda and Wendisch, 2018). Trp transport engineering, how-ever, successfully improved Trp production when the Trp uptake system was deleted (P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda and Wendisch, 2018). Assuming that this system imports 7-Cl-Trp into the C. glutamicum cell, deletion of its gene may also be relevant for improved 7-Cl-Trp producing strains. 3.6. 7-Chloro-tryptophan production from alternative carbon sources Glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source of C. glutamicum and a proof-of-concept for glucose-based 7-Cl-Trp production was reached. However, feedstocks that do not have competing uses in human and animal nutrition are to be preferred for large-scale fer-mentations. Metabolic engineering strategies for access of C. glutamicum to the alternative carbon sources arabinose, xylose and glucosamine have been developed and applied to amino acid production (Meiswinkel et al., 2013; Sasaki et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2011; Uhde et al., 2013). For access to arabinose C. glutamicum HalT1 was transformed with pECXT99A-araBAD containing the heterologous operon araBAD from E. coli for arabinose catabolism (Sasaki et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2011). The resulting strain grew with a growth rate of 0.08 h-1 and produced 52 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 7; Table 3). Efficient xylose utilization by C. glutamicum required hetero-logous expression of the xylose isomerase XylA gene from Xanthomonas campestris and overexpression of the endogenous gene coding for xy-lulokinase XylB (Meiswinkel et al., 2013). C. glutamicum HalT1 (pECXT99A-xylAB) showed a specific growth rate of 0.07 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 in minimal medium with 40 g L-1 xylose and produced 34 \u00b1 2mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.3 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 7; Table 3). Glucosamine, a constituent of chitin and one of the most abundant amino sugars in soil, is a poor growth substrate for C. glutamicum (Uhde et al., 2013). For efficient glucosamine utilization the endogenous glucosamine-6-phos-phate deaminase gene nagB was overexpressed (Uhde et al., 2013). C. glutamicum HalT1 (pECXT99A-nagB) grew in CGXII with 40 g L-1 glu-cosamine with a specific growth rate of 0.11 h-1 and produced 51 \u00b1 3mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp. For comparison, C. glutamicum HalT1 grew in CGXII medium with 40 g L-1 glucose with a specific growth rate of 0.13 h-1 and produced 56 \u00b1 5mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 7, Table 3). Taken together, 7-Cl-Trp production has been shown using glucose as well as the alternative feedstocks glucosamine, arabinose and xylose as growth substrates for the C. glutamicum host. 4. Conclusion Fermentative production of the halogenated amino acid 7-Cl-Trp from sugars, ammonium and chloride salts was enabled by recombinant C. glutamicum expressing the genes coding for FAD-dependent halo-genase RebH and NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF from L. aerocolonigenes. Chlorination of Trp to 7-Cl-Trp by C. glutamicum was improved by optimizing the RBS of rebH. Production of 7-Cl-Trp was limited by inhibition of 7-Cl-Trp and the chlorination efficiency. Strains able to produce 7-Cl-Trp and Trp from the alternative carbon sources arabinose, glucosamine and xylose were constructed.

        "A B S T R A C T",
        "Halogenated compounds, like 7-chloro-L-tryptophan, are important intermediates or components of bioactive substances relevant for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agrochemical industries. About 20% of all pharma-ceutical small molecule drugs and around 30% of all active compounds in agrochemistry are halogenated. Chemical halogenation procedures usually are characterized by the use of hazardous or even highly toxic chemicals. Recently, a biocatalytic process for L-tryptophan halogenation at the gram-scale using FAD-dependent halogenase and NADH-dependent flavin reductase enzymes has been described. Many proteinogenic amino acids are produced by fermentation using Corynebacterium glutamicum. The fermentative production of L-glutamate and L-lysine, for example, is operated at the million-ton scale. However, fermentative production of halogenated amino acids has not yet been described. In this study, fermentative production of the halogenated amino acid 7-chloro-L-tryptophan from sugars, ammonium and chloride salts was achieved. This required metabolic en-gineering of an L-tryptophan producing C. glutamicum strain for expression of the genes coding for FAD-de-pendent halogenase RebH and NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes. Chlorination of L-tryptophan to 7-chloro-L-tryptophan by recombinant C. glutamicum was improved by opti-mizing the RBS of rebH. Metabolic engineering enabled production of 7-chloro-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophan from the alternative carbon sources arabinose, glucosamine and xylose.",
        "1. Introduction",
        "Halogenated amino acids are sought after by the pharmaceutical, chemical and agrochemical industries (Diederich and Stang, 2008). They are found in various natural products including the antibiotics chloramphenicol and pyrroindomycin, the plant growth-regulating thienodolin, and the antifungal pyrrolnitrin (Hammer et al., 1997; van P\u00e9e and H\u00f6lzer, 1999). Rebeccamycin is an indolocarbazole alkaloid antibiotic that inhibits DNA topoisomerase I and is produced naturally by Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes (Nishizawa et al., 2005; Onaka et al., 2003). 7-Chloro-L-tryptophan (7-Cl-Trp) is a precursor of rebeccamycin. Halogenation of L-tryptophan (Trp) requires two enzymes encoded in the reb cluster of L. aerocolonigenes: the FADH-dependent halogenase RebH and NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF (Nishizawa et al., 2005). Halogenase RebH uses FADH2, molecular oxygen (O2) and chloride (Cl-) to halogenate its substrate Trp yielding 7-Cl-Trp. In turn, recycling of the reduced cofactor FADH2 requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent flavin reductase RebF. Recently, a biocatalytic process for L-tryptophan halogenation at the gram-scale has been described based on the purified enzymes and cross-linked enzyme aggregates including alcohol dehydrogenase for NADH recycling with isobutanol (Frese and Sewald, 2015; Schnepel and Sewald, 2017). However, production of the halogenated amino acid 7-Cl-Trp by fer-mentation has neither been described for the native L. aerocolonigenes nor for other microorganisms.",
        "Corynebacterium glutamicum is the work horse of fermentative amino acid production (Eggeling and Bott, 2015; Hermann, 2003; Lee et al., 2016; Wendisch et al., 2016). Besides its use in the million-ton scale L-glutamate and L-lysine processes, this bacterium has been engineered for production of various compounds including alcohols (Inui et al., 2004; Jojima et al., 2015; Siebert and Wendisch, 2015; Wendisch et al., 2016), diamines (Wendisch et al., 2018) like putrescine (Schneider and Wendisch, 2010), organic acids (Wieschalka et al., 2013), terpenoids (Heider et al., 2014) such as patchoulol (Henke et al., 2018) or non-",

        "proteinogenic amino acids (Wendisch, 2016) such as GABA (Jorge et al., 2016, 2017; Kim et al., 2013; P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2016). C. glu-tamicum has also been engineered to produce aromatic amino acids including Trp and aromatic compounds amenable from intermediates of the shikimate and chorismate pathways (Lee and Wendisch, 2017). Recently, a metabolic engineering strategy to overproduce Trp and related compounds such as 4-hydroxybenzoate has been described (Purwanto et al., 2018). Strain engineering for Trp production included plasmid-based expression of trpD from E. coli and genome-based ex-pression of trpEFBR coding for feedback-resistant anthranillate synthase, together with deletion of csm encoding chorismate mutase and ex-pression of aroGFBR encoding feedback-resistant 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase from E. coli in the vdh-deleted genome locus (Purwanto et al., 2018).",
        "Here, we describe metabolic engineering of 7-Cl-Trp producing strains based on the above described Trp producing strain (Fig. 1). Overexpression of the genes encoding the FADH-dependent halogenase RebH and the NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF from L. aero-colonigenes enabled halogenation of Trp to 7-Cl-Trp. Moreover, pro-duction of 7-Cl-Trp and Trp from the alternative carbon sources like arabinose, xylose and glucosamine that do not have competing uses for human and animal nutrition was established.",

        "The measurements were done in triplicates. The reaction mixture had a final volume of 0.5ml and contained 5mM Trp, 1 U/ml ADH from Rhodococcus sp. (s. below), 2.5 U/ml PrnF from P. fluorescens (s. below), 0.01mM FAD, 1mM NAD, 5% isopropanol, 0.005mM PMSF, 5mM Na2HPO4, 15mM NaCl and 250 \u03bcl of crude extract. It was in-cubated at 30 \u00b0C for 10min. The reaction was stopped with 187.5 \u03bcl methanol. The supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Product formation was calculated based on the peak area in comparison to a calibration curve of 7-Cl-Trp. Since we and Frese et al., 2014, observed difficulties in purification of RebF, we used the easily obtainable PrnF for this in vitro assay.",

        "For the overproduction of PrnF from P. fluorescens, P. putida KT2440 was transformed with pCIBhis-prnF. For the expression, 500ml LB were inoculated with 5ml of the P. putida KT2440(pCIBhis-prnF) overnight culture. The main culture was cultivated for 1 day at 30 \u00b0C with 50 \u03bcg ml-1 tetracycline. Then the cells were spun down and stored at-20 \u00b0C. For overexpression of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), pET21-ADH was transformed in BL21(DE3). After inoculated from an overnight culture to an OD 0.1, the cells were cultivated at 37 \u00b0C to an OD of 0.6 before the temperature was lowered to 21 \u00b0C and the expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After 4 h the cells were spun down and stored at -20 \u00b0C.",
        "2.3.4. Enzyme purification",
        "All steps during the purification were done at 4 \u00b0C. To purify the His6-tagged PrnF, P. putida cells from a 500ml LB culture were centrifuged and resuspended in TGNI5 buffer (20mM Tris, 300mM NaCl, 5% glycerin, 5 mM imidazole). To inhibit the protease activity 1mM PMSF was added. The cells were disrupted by sonication (UP 200 S, Dr. Hielscher GmbH, Teltow, Germany) on ice at an amplitude of 55% and a duty cycle of 0.5 for 4min. After centrifugation (20,200 \u00d7 g, 60min, 4 \u00b0C) the supernatant was filtered and poured in Polypropylene columns 5ml which a had bed volume of 2ml Ni-NTA Superflow from Qiagen. The column was washed twice with TNGI5 and once with TNGI20 (20mM Tris, 300mM NaCl, 5% glycerin, 20mM imidazole). The protein was eluted with TNGI buffer which contained 200mM imidazole. The protein was analyzed using a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). For the pur-ification of the ADH, a heat precipitation method was used. The cells were resuspended in 6.6 ml 10mM K2HPO4, pH 7.4, and disrupted 4min with 55% amplitude and 0.5 cycles on ice in the UP200S Ultrasonic Processor from Hielscher Ultrasound Technology. The crude extract was taken after centrifugation and heated up to 60 \u00b0C for 20min. The enzyme was stored at -20 \u00b0C.",
        "2.3.5. Determination of the alcohol dehydrogenase activity",
        "The specific activity of the overexpressed alcohol dehydrogenase (crude extract) was determined in triplicates by monitoring an increase of absorption at \u03bb=340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH + H+ to NAD+ (\u03b5=6.3ml mmol-1 cm-1) in a final volume of 1ml. The reac-tion mixture contained 910 \u03bcl of 10 mM K2HPO4 pH 7.4, 5% iso-propanol (2-Propanol), 250 \u03bcM NAD and 20 \u03bcl of the crude extract.

        "3. Results and discussion",
        "3.1. C. glutamicum is unable to use Trp as nitrogen and carbon sources",
        "For the production of halogenated tryptophans it is beneficial if the production host cannot degrade the final product. As a first approach, it was tested if C. glutamicum can use Trp as sole nitrogen source, C. glutamicum WT was grown in CGXII minimal medium lacking urea and ammonium sulfate as nitrogen sources but containing 10 g L-1 glucose as carbon source and either 10mM Trp or 10mM nitrogen (urea+ ammonium sulfate) as nitrogen source. While C. glutamicum grew with urea+ ammonium sulfate as nitrogen source at a specific growth rate of 0.35 \u00b1 0.01 h-1, Trp did not serve as nitrogen source for growth (Fig. 2). Second, it was tested if Trp can be used as sole carbon source, C. glutamicum was grown in CGXII minimal medium with either 10mM Trp or with 10mM glucose as sole carbon source. No growth with 10mM Trp as carbon source was observed, whereas C. glutamicum grew with a specific growth rate of 0.31 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 with 10mM glucose (Fig. 2).",
        "From the experiments with Trp it was expected that 7-Cl-Trp would serve neither as a carbon nor as a nitrogen source. To test if C. glutamicum WT can metabolize 7-Cl-Trp, the WT was cultivated in the presence of 0.1 mM 7-Cl-Trp in CGXII containing 10mM nitrogen (urea+ ammonium sulfate) as nitrogen source and 10mM glucose as carbon source. C. glutamicum WT grew to a biomass concentration of 1.18 \u00b1 0.03 g/l with a growth rate of 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 h-1. Quantitation of 7-Cl-Trp in the medium supernatant revealed that comparable 7-Cl-Trp concentrations of 0.1 \u00b1 0.01mM after 0 h, 12 h and 24 h (data not shown). Thus, during growth in minimal medium C. glutamicum is un-able to metabolize 7-Cl-Trp.",
        "The inability of C. glutamicum to use Trp as sole nitrogen or carbon source is likely due to the lack of tryptophan degrading enzyme(s). E. coli, for example, is able to use tryptophan as sole carbon source by degrading tryptophan to indole, pyruvate and ammonia by tryptopha-nase (Yanofsky et al., 1991). Alternatively, tryptophan is degraded by a tryptophan oxygenase as e.g. in Bacillus megaterium. Tryptophan oxy-genase forms N-formyl-L-kynurenine from Trp, which subsequently is catabolised to acetate, succinate and ammonium (Bouknight and Sadoff, 1975).",
        "A reduction of the growth rate was observed when 0.1 mM 7-Cl-Trp was added to glucose minimal medium. Therefore, it was tested to what extent 7-Cl-Trp perturbs growth of C. glutamicum in glucose minimal medium. The presence of 0.1 mM 7-Cl-Trp reduced the maximal growth rate to 50% and in the presence of 0.5mM 7-Cl-Trp, no significant growth was observed (data not shown). Therefore, although not me-tabolized, 7-Cl-Trp inhibits growth of C. glutamicum.",
        "3.2. Heterologous expression of halogenase and flavin reductase genes in a Trp overproducing C. glutamicum strain",
        "To enable fermentative production of 7-Cl-Trp by C. glutamicum, the genes encoding FADH-dependent halogenase RebH and NADH-depen-dent flavin reductase RebF from L. aerocolonigenes were expressed in Trp overproducing strain Tp679. Since RebH and RebF derive from the same organism and are likely co-evolved for functioning together, we chose to use RebH and RebF in our fementative approach. To confirm that both gene products were functional in the C. glutamicum host, crude extracts after growth in LB medium with 1mM IPTG were as-sayed for halogenase and flavin reductase activities. While the specific enzyme activity of the purified halogenase RebH has been reported to be 145 mU/mg at 25 \u00b0C (turnover number of 0.29 s-1) (Yeh et al., 2007), a specific enzyme activity of 0.90 \u00b1 0.01 mU/mg (turnover",

To test if Trp serves as sole carbon source C. glutamicum WT was cultured in carbon source-free CGXII minimal medium supplemented either with 10mM Trp (\u25b2) or 10mM glucose (\u0394).

The low activity in crude extracts (about 0.6% activity of the purified enzyme) was in accordance with protein levels observed in SDS-PAGE of these crude extracts (Supplement data Fig. 1). Similarly, the specific enzyme activity of flavin reductase RebF in crude extracts (28 \u00b1 4 mU/mg; turnover number of 0.013 \u00b1 0.002 s-1) was about 1% of that observed for purified flavin reductase RebF (Yeh et al., 2005), which was in accordance with SDS-PAGE analysis of the crude extracts (Supplement data Fig. 1).",
        "For the fermentative production of 7-Cl-Trp by C. glutamicum HalT1 which expresses rebF and rebH, glucose minimal medium CgXII was tested with different chloride salts as halogen substrates for Trp chlorination. It is known that C. glutamicum withstands relatively high concentrations of sodium chloride and potassium chloride (half-max-imal growth rates at \u02dc490mM and \u02dc480mM, respectively) (Zahoor et al., 2014). Hence, low concentrations of chloride salts (potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium) added to the growth medium of C. glu-tamicum were expected to have little effect on growth. In minimal medium with 50mM NaCl C. glutamicum HalT1 showed a specific growth rate of 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 and produced 20 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 3; Table 2). With 50mM potassium chloride a specific growth rate of 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 and production of 19 \u00b1 2mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp resulted (Fig. 3; Table 2). As the minimal medium CGXII contains calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate (Eggeling and Bott, 2005), the calcium chloride was raised to 25mM and instead of magnesium sulfate 50mM magnesium chloride, respectively, were used. With 25mM CaCl2 a growth rate of 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 resulted and the strain produced 62 \u00b1 7mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 g L-1 Trp. With 25mM MgCl2 C. glutamicum HalT1 produced 54 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.3 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp with a spe-cific growth rate of 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 h-1. The negative control strain Tp679 trpD (pEKEx3) did not produce 7-Cl-Trp (data not shown) under these conditions. Since CaCl2 resulted in the highest 7-Cl-Trp titers, the fol-lowing experiments were performed with CaCl2. The improved per-formance in the presence of calcium ions currently is not understood, but tryptophan 7-halogenase was found to contain calcium in one re-port (Gribble, 2004).",
        "Taken together, fermentative production of 7-Cl-Trp by re-combinant C. glutamicum has been enabled. However, 7-Cl-Trp titers are around 50 to 100-fold lower than Trp titers produced by the same strain. 3.3. Determination of intra-and extracellular 7-Cl-Trp and Trp concentrations during 7-Cl-Trp production by C. glutamicum HalT1",
        "One possible explanation of the finding that 7-Cl-Trp titers are around 50 to 100-fold lower than Trp titers may be inefficient export of 7-Cl-Trp out of the C. glutamicum cell. Since the genes of C. glutamicum coding for export system(s) for Trp and/or 7-Cl-Trp are unknown (Marin and Kr\u00e4mer, 2007), genetic experiments were not possible. Under the assumption that inefficient 7-Cl-Trp export resulted in low extracellular but high intracellular 7-Cl-Trp concentrations, the in-tracellular Trp and 7-Cl-Trp content and the supernatant concentrations were quantified during 7-Cl-Trp production by C. glutamicum HalT1 (Fig. 4).",
        "C. glutamicum HalT1 was cultivated in CGXII with 4% glucose and 50mM CaCl2 and grew with a specific growth rate of 0.19 \u00b1 0.01 h-1. In the stationary phase from 24 h to 72 h the biomass concentration decreased from 13.2 \u00b1 0.9 g L-1 to 7.8 \u00b1 0.5 g L-1 (Fig. 4). During this time the extracellular concentration of 7-Cl-Trp increased from 15 \u00b1 1mg L-1 to 38 \u00b1 1mg L-1 (Figs. 4 and 5). The extracellular Trp concentration was 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 after 24 h and reached a plateau of about 2 g L-1 at 36 h to 72 h. The extracellular 7-Cl-Trp concentration increased gradually from 15 \u00b1 1mg L-1 to 38 \u00b1 1mg L-1 in the period from 24 h to 72 h (Fig. 4). At all time points assayed the extracellular Trp concentration exceeded the extracellular 7-Cl-Trp concentration. For example, at 72 h, the extracellular Trp concentration (2.1 g L-1 or about 10mM) was 65-fold that of 7-Cl-Trp (38mg L-1 or about 0.16mM; Fig. 4).",
        "After 24 h no intracellular 7-Cl-Trp was detected, although extra-cellular 7-Cl-Trp was present in the supernatant (s. above; 15 \u00b1 1mg L-1). At later time points, intracellular 7-Cl-Trp concentrations of 0.34 \u00b1 0.05mg g[CDW]-1 to 0.46 \u00b1 0.05mg g[CDW]-1 were de-tected (Fig. 4). During this period, intracellular Trp concentrations ranged between 14 and 19mg g[CDW]-1) (Fig. 4). Since the C. gluta-micum cell volume has been determined at 2 \u03bcl mg[CDW]-1 (Gutmann et al., 1992), intracellular concentrations of about 34mM Trp (at 72 h) and about 1mM 7-Cl-Trp (at 72 h) were detected. Since the in-tracellular Trp and 7-Cl-Trp concentrations were about three and about six-fold higher than the respective extracellular concentrations, export of these compounds out of the C. glutamicum cell may limit production to some extent. However, as observed for the extracellular concentra-tions, the intracellular concentration of Trp was much larger (34 fold) than that of 7-Cl-Trp. Thus, the major bottleneck of 7-Cl-Trp production by C. glutamicum is inefficient halogenation of Trp.",
        "3.4. Provision of intracellular Trp by feeding Trp or the dipeptide Ala-Trp",
        "It may be possible that biosynthetic precursors of Trp inhibit chlorination of Trp to 7-Cl-Trp. The biosynthetic precursors are likely present at increased intracellular concentrations in a Trp overproducing strain. Therefore, instead of using a Trp overproducing strain, the plasmid pEKEx3-rebH-rebF for expression of the FADH-dependent ha-logenase and the flavin reductase genes was used to transform C. glu-tamicum WT. To produce 7-Cl-Trp this strain was grown in CGXII 4% glucose with 50mM CaCl2, and 2mM Trp was added to the medium. Since import of Trp occurs via the importer AroP (Wehrmann et al., 1995), Trp was expected to be available intracellularly for halogenation to 7-Cl-Trp, while the intracellular concentrations of its precursors are not expected to be increased. C. glutamicum WT(pEKEx3-rebH-rebF) grew with a specific growth rate of 0.15 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 and produced 21 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp after 48 h. This 7-Cl-Trp concentration (about 0.1 mM) is much lower than the Trp concentration added to the medium (2mM).",
        "As an alternative, Trp was provided intracellularly by feeding the dipeptide L-alanyl-L-tryptophan (Ala-Trp). Dipeptides like Ala-Trp are taken up actively into the C. glutamicum cell by peptide transport sys-tems before they are hydrolyzed by peptide hydrolases (Tr\u00f6tschel et al.,",

        "To test if expression of the halogenase and flavin reductase genes is limiting production of 7-Cl-Trp, two expression vectors differing by their origins of replication and copy numbers were compared. In ad-dition, the influence of altering the ribosome binding site (RBS) to support a higher translation initiation rate of rebH was tested. The synthetic rebH-rebF present in pEKEx3-rebH-rebF was cloned into pECXT99 A (Kirchner and Tauch, 2003) (Table 1). The sequence of the RBS of rebH was optimized using RBS calculator (https://salislab.net/ software/). Based on this optimized RBS, the vectors pEKEx3-op-timRBS-rebH-rebF and pECXT99A-optimRBS-rebH-rebF were con-structed.

The genes rebH and rebF were cloned with the opti-mized RBS in the pECXT99 A vector and transformed Tp679 (pCES208-trpD). The build strain HalT4 was grown in CGXII with 4% glucose and 50mM CaCl2. The specific growth rate was 0.16 \u00b1 0.006 h-1, and 66 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.3 \u00b1 0.02 g L-1 Trp were accumulated. An increase of 7-Cl-Trp production by 56% could be observed between HalT3 and HalT4 which arrived from the optimized RBS. Thus, the RBS in combination with the pEKEx3 vector (Stansen et al., 2005), which is the expression vector of HalT1, was optimized as well. The plasmid pEKEx3-optimRBS-rebH-rebF was transformed in Tp679 (pCES208-trpD). The resulting strain HalT2 was cultivated in CGXII with 4% glucose and 50mM CaCl2. HalT2 reached a specific growth rate of 0.11 \u00b1 0.004 h-1 and a production of 108 \u00b1 2mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp was measured (Fig. 6). Hence, there is an im-provement in production of 7-Cl-Trp of 56% from HalT1 to HalT2. The production of Trp decreased by 48% from HalT1 to HalT2. But 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 of the precursor anthranilate (Ant) were detected in HalT2. This can be caused through an inhibitory effect of halogenated compounds on TrpD (Fig. 1). It is known that halogenated Ant is a competitive inhibitor of PqsA, the initial enzyme of 4-hydroxy-2-al-kylquinolines biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that halo-genated Ant competitively inhibits Ant converting TrpD (Lesic et al., 2007). Until now, it is not known if 7-Cl-Trp inhibits TrpD or other enzymes of the Trp pathway in C. glutamicum. The intracellular con-centration of the cofactor FAD may be limiting although the in-tracellular concentrations of FAD or FMN are about 4.5mM OD610-1 and 2mM OD610-1, respectively (Toyoda et al., 2014). The addition of 2mM FMN to the cultivation medium improved 7-Cl-Trp production by about two fold (62 \u00b1 7mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp for HalT1 with 50mM CaCl2, 4% glucose without added FMN as compared to 130 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp when 2mM FMN were added, Fig. 3 and data not shown). How-ever, the addition of FMN is too costly for fermentative production. Our results clearly show that despite sufficient provision of Trp by the re-combinant C. glutamicum strains, halogenation proceeds to much lower concentrations as compared to Trp production (Figs. 3 and 4). Likewise, classical biocatalytic halogenation stops at a distinct conversion (Schnepel and Sewald, 2017). For example, Frese et al. (2014) as well as Payne et al. (2013) converted Trp at concentrations of only 0.5mM, which led to almost complete conversion. Up-scaling required to in-crease the volume while maintaining the low substrate concentration, e.g. Payne et al. 2013 converted 100mg Trp in a volume of 12 l (Payne et al., 2013). Although operated at the gram scale, bromination of Trp using CLEAs also had to be operated at a low concentration (i.e. 1 g Trp in 5 l; Frese and Sewald, 2015). Possible limitations may be product inhibition of the halogenase, insufficient supply of oxygen and/or redox cofactors. Thus, chlorination of Trp in solution using purified enzymes or preparations such as CLEAs currently is restricted to conversion of few milligrams of substrate (Frese and Sewald, 2015). Fermentation as described here may similarly be limited by product inhibition of the halogenase enzyme, thus, enzyme engineering to overcome such lim-itation would benefit both biocatalytic and fermentative processes. The expression of rebH and rebF of the strains HalT1 to HalT4 was shown by SDS-PAGE (Supplement Fig. 1). Strain HalT2, which accumulated the highest concentration of 7-Cl-Trp, showed the highest expression of the rebH gene. Thus, future strain development may target further rebH overexpression. It may also be important to balance the concentrations of the involved enzymes RebH and RebF. This may be done e.g. by varying translation initiation rates by changing the sequence and/or position of the ribosome binding sites (Henke et al., 2016). Alter-natively, fusion proteins of RebH and RebF may show better perfor-mance (Payne et al., 2013). Higher FAD concentrations within the cell",

        "may be reached by deletion of rshA (Toyoda et al., 2014) or by over-expression of ribF (Taniguchi and Wendisch, 2015). Redox cofactor recycling may be improved by oxygen-deprivation conditions as shown for L-alanine production by recombinant C. glutamicum (Jojima et al., 2010). It may be important to identify the transport system for 7-Cl-Trp export. In the case of fermentative L-lysine production, the L-lysine export gene lysE was overexpressed in L-lysine producing strains (Unthan et al., 2015). Unfortunately, currently the Trp export system of C. glutamicum is unknown (it may also be relevant for 7-Cl-Trp export) (P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda and Wendisch, 2018). Trp transport engineering, how-ever, successfully improved Trp production when the Trp uptake system was deleted (P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda and Wendisch, 2018). Assuming that this system imports 7-Cl-Trp into the C. glutamicum cell, deletion of its gene may also be relevant for improved 7-Cl-Trp producing strains.",
        "3.6. 7-Chloro-tryptophan production from alternative carbon sources",
        "Glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source of C. glutamicum and a proof-of-concept for glucose-based 7-Cl-Trp production was reached. However, feedstocks that do not have competing uses in human and animal nutrition are to be preferred for large-scale fer-mentations. Metabolic engineering strategies for access of C. glutamicum to the alternative carbon sources arabinose, xylose and glucosamine have been developed and applied to amino acid production (Meiswinkel et al., 2013; Sasaki et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2011; Uhde et al., 2013).",
        "For access to arabinose C. glutamicum HalT1 was transformed with pECXT99A-araBAD containing the heterologous operon araBAD from E. coli for arabinose catabolism (Sasaki et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2011). The resulting strain grew with a growth rate of 0.08 h-1 and produced 52 \u00b1 1mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 7; Table 3). Efficient xylose utilization by C. glutamicum required hetero-logous expression of the xylose isomerase XylA gene from Xanthomonas campestris and overexpression of the endogenous gene coding for xy-lulokinase XylB (Meiswinkel et al., 2013). C. glutamicum HalT1 (pECXT99A-xylAB) showed a specific growth rate of 0.07 \u00b1 0.01 h-1 in minimal medium with 40 g L-1 xylose and produced 34 \u00b1 2mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.3 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 7; Table 3). Glucosamine, a constituent of chitin and one of the most abundant amino sugars in soil, is a poor growth substrate for C. glutamicum (Uhde et al., 2013). For efficient glucosamine utilization the endogenous glucosamine-6-phos-phate deaminase gene nagB was overexpressed (Uhde et al., 2013). C. glutamicum HalT1 (pECXT99A-nagB) grew in CGXII with 40 g L-1 glu-cosamine with a specific growth rate of 0.11 h-1 and produced 51 \u00b1 3mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp. For comparison, C. glutamicum HalT1 grew in CGXII medium with 40 g L-1 glucose with a specific growth rate of 0.13 h-1 and produced 56 \u00b1 5mg L-1 7-Cl-Trp and 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 g L-1 Trp (Fig. 7, Table 3). Taken together, 7-Cl-Trp production has been shown using glucose as well as the alternative feedstocks glucosamine, arabinose and xylose as growth substrates for the C. glutamicum host.",
        "4. Conclusion",
        "Fermentative production of the halogenated amino acid 7-Cl-Trp from sugars, ammonium and chloride salts was enabled by recombinant C. glutamicum expressing the genes coding for FAD-dependent halo-genase RebH and NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF from L. aerocolonigenes. Chlorination of Trp to 7-Cl-Trp by C. glutamicum was improved by optimizing the RBS of rebH. Production of 7-Cl-Trp was limited by inhibition of 7-Cl-Trp and the chlorination efficiency. Strains able to produce 7-Cl-Trp and Trp from the alternative carbon sources arabinose, glucosamine and xylose were constructed.",
