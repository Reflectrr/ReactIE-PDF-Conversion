It was revealed that the host plant, along with its cryptic endophytic micro-flora, produces the biosynthetically unique core structural moiety 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) that serves as the unique starter unit for maytansine biosynthesis. However, the biosynthetic step of halogenase-mediated incorporation of chlorine, which is missing in the host plant, is accomplished by the culturable stem endophytic bacterial community. Our results provide new insights into plant-endophyte communication for the biosynthesis of maytansine. Endophytic microorganisms are ubiquitous in plants in the tissues and apoplastic compartments, both above-and below-ground, where they establish complex communities that can substantially contribute to the overall \ue103tness of the host plants.1\u20135 Microorganisms rarely exist in \u201caxenic forms\u201d in nature and endophytes are no exception.6 In microbial communities within plants, the interplay between endophytes and plants, and the production of secondary metabolites results in a variety of functional traits of both agricultural and ecological importance.6\u201311 Thus far, it has been \ue103rmly estab-lished that suitable plant-endophyte and endophyte\u2013endophyte interactions (fungi\u2013fungi, fungi\u2013bacteria, and/or bacteria\u2013 ical Engineering, Chair of Technical 66, 44227 Dortmund, Germany , Department of Chemistry and Chemical and Analytical Chemistry, TU Dortmund, ermany.

In the last decades, studies on interspecies and multispecies crosstalk of endophytes have led to the elucidation of functional traits of endophytes concomitant to associated organisms.12 Their coexistence within complex and mixed communities within their speci\ue103c niches lead to their coevolution such that they can \u201cwithstand ecological forces\u201d and function in ways that mostly cannot be accomplished by single organisms.13 For example, it was recently shown that a root-associated bacterial community of the tobacco plant, Nicotiana attenuata, functions as a consortium to provide protection to the host plant against sudden-wilt disease.14 Notably, this important ecological func-tion could not be accomplished by single organisms of the root-associated bacterial community.14 Several recent studies have further lent evidence to the fact that certain so-called plant metabolites are actually biosynthesized by associated microbial community. For instance, we have shown that the original source organisms responsible for the biosynthesis of the important anticancer and cytotoxic compound maytansine (Fig. 1a) is the endophytic bacterial community harbored speci\ue103cally within the roots of Putterlickia verrucosa and Put-terlickia retrospinosa plants (Celastraceae).15 Chemical and molecular characterization of the root endophytic bacterial community revealed that maytansine is actually a biosynthetic product of Putterlickia root-associated endophytic bacterial community. Given the fact that maytansine was discovered in the 1970s not only in Putterlickia species but also in other Celastraceae plants of the genus Maytenus,16,17 along with our aforemen-tioned results on Putterlickia endophytes, we aimed to investi-gate the endophytes harbored in Maytenus serrata plants. The main difference, however, was that maytansine was found to be localized in the above-ground tissues of Maytenus plants compared to its accumulation in the roots of Putterlickia plants.16,17 Given these facts, in the present work, we answer the following open questions: RSC Adv., 2016, 6, 10011\u201310016 | 10011 Fig. 1 (a) Maytansine.

View Article Onlinethemselves,5 similar to what was demonstrated earlier for Put-terlickia plants.15 Taking cues from our preliminary results, we examined the biosynthesis of maytansine in the Cameroonian M. serrata and the possible contribution of endophytic bacterial community harbored in different tissues (root, bark and leaf) of the plant. Firstly, we evaluated the different tissues of Maytenus plant and the endophytic bacterial community for the presence of genes biosynthesizing the important starter enzyme, AHBA synthase (3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase).15 This enzyme comprises of a unique mC7N structural moiety which forms the common precursor of different ansamycins.18 Thus, a pair of degenerate primers (primer pair P3; ESI, Table S1\u2021) were designed amplifying the conserved amino acid regions of different genes namely asnF, asm24, mitA, napF and rifK.15 As a positive control, the genomic DNA of Actinosynnema pretiosum subsp. auranticum (DSM 44131) was ampli\ue103ed resulting in an approx. 755 bp fragment. Further, the root, leaf and bark tissues and the respective endophytic bacterial communities were subjected to the optimized PCR conditions using the same degenerate primer pair. All the plant tissues ampli\ue103ed the ex-pected fragment of AHBA synthase gene (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, none of the endophytic bacterial communities produced the desired ampli\ue103cation product. The positive PCR ampli\ue103ed products were sequenced, aligned, identi\ue103ed, and further translated into protein sequences. The positive control showed 100% homology to 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase (AHBA synthase; EMBL AAC13997.1 and UniProt Identi\ue103er Q44131). Similarly, the ampli\ue103ed products from the different plant tissues also showed sequence homology to 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase (ESI, Table S2\u2021). The sequences of the ampli\ue103ed PCR products have been submitted to the EMBL-Bank. We also evaluated the aerial and non-aerial tissues of the GhanaianM. serrata, which does not contain maytansine, for the presence of AHBA synthase genes. Interestingly, AHBA synthase genes were found to be absent in this plant (data not shown). Thus far, we could conclude that only the M. serrata plant growing in the rainforest of Cameroon contains the genetic blueprint of the starter enzyme (AHBA synthase) for the biosynthesis of maytansine. Taking ansamitocin biosynthetic pathway into consider-ation, we decided to further investigate the post-polyketide synthase modi\ue103cation of the ansamitocin pathway. One of the key steps in this pathway is the conversion of proansamitocin to gels of purified PCR-amplified products of halogenase genes (asm12; spanning around 1300 bp) in endophytic bacterial community of bark tissue of Maytenus plants.

View Article Online19-chloroproansamitocin that introduces chlorine into the structure. Chlorination is an important FADH2-dependent halogenation catalyzed by different halogenase enzymes. In the ansamitocin biosynthetic pathway of positive control A. pre-tiosum, this step is achieved by the gene asm12, which is a FADH2-dependent halogenase.19 We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the plant tissues and the endophytic communities for the presence of halogenase genes in order to elucidate which organism (host plant or endophytic bacterial community) is responsible for incorporation of chlorine towards completing the biosynthesis of maytansine. We employed two strategies to answer this question. In our \ue103rst approach, we evaluated for the presence of halogenase gene asm12, which catalyzes the \ue103rst step post-polyketide synthase modi\ue103cation responsible for the chlorination step in ansamitocin biosynthesis. For the detec-tion of asm12 gene, the genomic DNA of plant tissues and endophytic community were subjected to PCR ampli\ue103cation using primer pairs P1 (ESI, Table S1\u2021). The P1 primers were designed based on the sequence of asm12 gene from A. pre-tiosum (DSM 44131). None of the plant tissues (leaf, stem, or root) ampli\ue103ed the desired product (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the leaf and root endophytic bacterial community also did not amplify the desired product (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, only the bark endophytic bacterial community (EC-MSR-B) could produce the desired fragment (Fig. 2b). As a positive control, the genomic DNA of A. pretiosum was ampli\ue103ed (spanning around 1300 bp). The positive fragments were sequenced, aligned, identi\ue103ed, and further translated into protein sequences. The positive control showed 99% homology to asm12 halogenase gene (EMBL AAM54090.1) and 100% Scheme 1 Proposed plant-endophyte cross-species biosynthetic pathw pathway and of trafficking of maytansine precursors between host plant biosynthesis of maytansine are marked with asterisks.

Although the bark endophytic community ampli\ue103ed the desired fragment, the homology with phylogenetically-related reference halogenase sequence (i.e., asm12 of A. pretiosum) was relatively low. In order to avoid any false positives, in our second approach we further analyzed the presence of any FADH2-dependent halo-genase irrespective of asm12 gene in particular. Therefore, we performed a second PCR analysis with degenerate primers deduced from highly conserved regions of six different FADH2-dependent halogenases (ansamitocin being only one of them) having different enzyme speci\ue103cities to produce different halogenated metabolites.20 We re-evaluated the plant tissue and endophytic bacterial communities for the presence of halogenase genes by subjecting them to PCR ampli\ue103cation with primer pair P2 (ESI, Table S1\u2021). For the positive control, we used the PCR puri\ue103ed 1300 bp asm12 gene of A. pretiosum as template for primer walking with P2. Simultaneously, the 1300 bp positive fragment of bark endophytic bacterial community was also subjected to second PCR using primer pair P2. As expected, we observed an approximately 550 bp ampli\ue103ed fragment for positive control and only bark endo-phytic bacterial community (Fig. 2c). None of the plant tissues or other endophytic bacterial communities ampli\ue103ed this fragment. The positive fragments were evaluated as detailed above. The positive control naturally showed 99% homology EMBL AF453501.1 and 97.2% homology to UniProt Identi\ue103er Q8KUG0. Interestingly, this time the bark endophytic bacterial community showed 100% homology to halogenase (EMBL CP001630.1) and 100% homology to UniProt Identi\ue103er C6W874 (tryptophan halogenase). ay of maytansine in M. serrata.

View Article OnlineAs expected, none of the isolated endophytes and endophytic bacterial communities could produce maytansine when fer-mented under laboratory conditions (outside the host plant). Furthermore, HRMS/MS allowed us to complement the genetic data; we could detect the major precursors (1\u20136) of maytansine in the plant tissues, particularly in the bark (ESI, Fig. S2 and Table S3\u2021). Thus far, using the combination of molecular and analytical data, we propose a plant-endophyte cross-species biosynthetic pathway for production ofmaytansine that occurs only in someM. serrata plants (such as the one sampled from Cameroonian rainforest) (Scheme 1). The host plant along with its unculturable or cryptic endophytes produces AHBA, the unique starter moiety of maytansine biosynthesis, by means of an aminoshikimate pathway21,22 that is absent in the cultivable bark endophytic bacterial community. AHBA is further converted to precursor 1, This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 which is taken up by the bark endophytic bacterial community to introduce chlorine (precursor 3 via reactive intermediate 2) using the halogenase enzyme that is absent in the host plant and its cryptic endophytes (ESI, Fig. S2 and Table S3\u2021). Further biosyn-thetic steps through intermediates 4\u20136 to the production of maytansine is achieved by the host plant (Scheme 1). Finally, we aimed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between the different endophytic bacterial communities iso-lated from the leaves, stems, and roots of the maytansine-containing M. serrata plant and those harbored in Putterlickia species.15 The 16S rRNA ampli\ue103cation of the endophytic bacte-rial communities (Fig. 3a) followed by phylogenetic evaluation using T-Coffee (ESI, Fig. S3\u2021) was done according to Kusari et al. (2014).15 The phenogram (Fig. 3b) revealed a clear clustering of leaf, bark and root endophytic bacterial communities of M. serrata to that of primary root endophytic bacterial communi-ties of Putterlickia plants. Interestingly, the bark endophytic bacterial community containing the halogenase gene (EC-MSR-B) clustered very close to the root endophytic bacterial communities of Putterlickia plants that were found to produce maytansine (PRR1 and PVR1).15 This shows plausible species-level relatedness between endophytic bacterial communities that contain the genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of maytansine. Interestingly, the endophytic bacterial communi-ties of M. serrata under our study also showed evolutionary relationships to bacteria harboring diverse hosts (niches) ranging from termites to earthworms (ESI, Fig. S4\u2021). Taken together, our study reveals a unique aspect of plant-endophyte communication where only the bark endophytic bacterial community of a selected M. serrata plant had coevolved a means to produce maytansine jointly with the host plant, including trafficking of the precursors from and to the host plant. In other M. serrata plants where this endophytic community is absent, there is no production of maytansine, as exempli\ue103ed not only by the Ghanaian M. serrata plant but also other Maytenus plants of different origin presently under our investigation (data not shown). Our results provide a scienti\ue103c handle to delve into further details of plant-endophyte communication not only on the transcriptome level but also the metabolome level to pinpoint regulation of host-endophyte communication. Our study further opens avenues to determine qualitative and quantitative pattern of localization and traf-\ue103cking of endophytes with regard to shared biosynthesis of maytansine. Further studies along these lines are currently underway.

In the last decades, studies on interspecies and multispecies crosstalk of endophytes have led to the elucidation of functional traits of endophytes concomitant to associated organisms.12 Their coexistence within complex and mixed communities within their speci\ue103c niches lead to their coevolution such that they can \u201cwithstand ecological forces\u201d and function in ways that mostly cannot be accomplished by single organisms.13 For example, it was recently shown that a root-associated bacterial community of the tobacco plant, Nicotiana attenuata, functions as a consortium to provide protection to the host plant against sudden-wilt disease.14 Notably, this important ecological func-tion could not be accomplished by single organisms of the root-associated bacterial community.14 Several recent studies have further lent evidence to the fact that certain so-called plant metabolites are actually biosynthesized by associated microbial community. For instance, we have shown that the original source organisms responsible for the biosynthesis of the important anticancer and cytotoxic compound maytansine (Fig. 1a) is the endophytic bacterial community harbored speci\ue103cally within the roots of Putterlickia verrucosa and Put-terlickia retrospinosa plants (Celastraceae).15 Chemical and molecular characterization of the root endophytic bacterial community revealed that maytansine is actually a biosynthetic product of Putterlickia root-associated endophytic bacterial community. Given the fact that maytansine was discovered in the 1970s not only in Putterlickia species but also in other Celastraceae plants of the genus Maytenus,16,17 along with our aforemen-tioned results on Putterlickia endophytes, we aimed to investi-gate the endophytes harbored in Maytenus serrata plants. The main difference, however, was that maytansine was found to be localized in the above-ground tissues of Maytenus plants compared to its accumulation in the roots of Putterlickia plants.16,17 Given these facts, in the present work, we answer the following open questions:",

Firstly, we evaluated the different tissues of Maytenus plant and the endophytic bacterial community for the presence of genes biosynthesizing the important starter enzyme, AHBA synthase (3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase).15 This enzyme comprises of a unique mC7N structural moiety which forms the common precursor of different ansamycins.18 Thus, a pair of degenerate primers (primer pair P3; ESI, Table S1\u2021) were designed amplifying the conserved amino acid regions of different genes namely asnF, asm24, mitA, napF and rifK.15 As a positive control, the genomic DNA of Actinosynnema pretiosum subsp. auranticum (DSM 44131) was ampli\ue103ed resulting in an approx. 755 bp fragment. Further, the root, leaf and bark tissues and the respective endophytic bacterial communities were subjected to the optimized PCR conditions using the same degenerate primer pair. All the plant tissues ampli\ue103ed the ex-pected fragment of AHBA synthase gene (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, none of the endophytic bacterial communities produced the desired ampli\ue103cation product. The positive PCR ampli\ue103ed products were sequenced, aligned, identi\ue103ed, and further translated into protein sequences. The positive control showed 100% homology to 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase (AHBA synthase; EMBL AAC13997.1 and UniProt Identi\ue103er Q44131). Similarly, the ampli\ue103ed products from the different plant tissues also showed sequence homology to 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase (ESI, Table S2\u2021). The sequences of the ampli\ue103ed PCR products have been submitted to the EMBL-Bank. We also evaluated the aerial and non-aerial tissues of the GhanaianM. serrata, which does not contain maytansine, for the presence of AHBA synthase genes. Interestingly, AHBA synthase genes were found to be absent in this plant (data not shown). Thus far, we could conclude that only the M. serrata plant growing in the rainforest of Cameroon contains the genetic blueprint of the starter enzyme (AHBA synthase) for the biosynthesis of maytansine. Taking ansamitocin biosynthetic pathway into consider-ation, we decided to further investigate the post-polyketide synthase modi\ue103cation of the ansamitocin pathway.

In the ansamitocin biosynthetic pathway of positive control A. pre-tiosum, this step is achieved by the gene asm12, which is a FADH2-dependent halogenase.19 We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the plant tissues and the endophytic communities for the presence of halogenase genes in order to elucidate which organism (host plant or endophytic bacterial community) is responsible for incorporation of chlorine towards completing the biosynthesis of maytansine. We employed two strategies to answer this question. In our \ue103rst approach, we evaluated for the presence of halogenase gene asm12, which catalyzes the \ue103rst step post-polyketide synthase modi\ue103cation responsible for the chlorination step in ansamitocin biosynthesis. For the detec-tion of asm12 gene, the genomic DNA of plant tissues and endophytic community were subjected to PCR ampli\ue103cation using primer pairs P1 (ESI, Table S1\u2021). The P1 primers were designed based on the sequence of asm12 gene from A. pre-tiosum (DSM 44131). None of the plant tissues (leaf, stem, or root) ampli\ue103ed the desired product (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the leaf and root endophytic bacterial community also did not amplify the desired product (Fig. 2b).

Although the bark endophytic community ampli\ue103ed the desired fragment, the homology with phylogenetically-related reference halogenase sequence (i.e., asm12 of A. pretiosum) was relatively low. In order to avoid any false positives, in our second approach we further analyzed the presence of any FADH2-dependent halo-genase irrespective of asm12 gene in particular. Therefore, we performed a second PCR analysis with degenerate primers deduced from highly conserved regions of six different FADH2-dependent halogenases (ansamitocin being only one of them) having different enzyme speci\ue103cities to produce different halogenated metabolites.20 We re-evaluated the plant tissue and endophytic bacterial communities for the presence of halogenase genes by subjecting them to PCR ampli\ue103cation with primer pair P2 (ESI, Table S1\u2021). For the positive control, we used the PCR puri\ue103ed 1300 bp asm12 gene of A. pretiosum as template for primer walking with P2. Simultaneously, the 1300 bp positive fragment of bark endophytic bacterial community was also subjected to second PCR using primer pair P2.

        "OnlineAs expected, none of the isolated endophytes and endophytic bacterial communities could produce maytansine when fer-mented under laboratory conditions (outside the host plant). Furthermore, HRMS/MS allowed us to complement the genetic data; we could detect the major precursors (1\u20136) of maytansine in the plant tissues, particularly in the bark (ESI, Fig. S2 and Table S3\u2021). Thus far, using the combination of molecular and analytical data, we propose a plant-endophyte cross-species biosynthetic pathway for production ofmaytansine that occurs only in someM. serrata plants (such as the one sampled from Cameroonian rainforest) (Scheme 1). The host plant along with its unculturable or cryptic endophytes produces AHBA, the unique starter moiety of maytansine biosynthesis, by means of an aminoshikimate pathway21,22 that is absent in the cultivable bark endophytic bacterial community. AHBA is further converted to precursor 1,",

Further biosyn-thetic steps through intermediates 4\u20136 to the production of maytansine is achieved by the host plant (Scheme 1). Finally, we aimed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between the different endophytic bacterial communities iso-lated from the leaves, stems, and roots of the maytansine-containing M. serrata plant and those harbored in Putterlickia species.15 The 16S rRNA ampli\ue103cation of the endophytic bacte-rial communities (Fig. 3a) followed by phylogenetic evaluation using T-Coffee (ESI, Fig. S3\u2021) was done according to Kusari et al. (2014).15 The phenogram (Fig. 3b) revealed a clear clustering of leaf, bark and root endophytic bacterial communities of M. serrata to that of primary root endophytic bacterial communi-ties of Putterlickia plants. Interestingly, the bark endophytic bacterial community containing the halogenase gene (EC-MSR-B) clustered very close to the root endophytic bacterial communities of Putterlickia plants that were found to produce maytansine (PRR1 and PVR1).15 This shows plausible species-level relatedness between endophytic bacterial communities that contain the genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of maytansine. Interestingly, the endophytic bacterial communi-ties of M. serrata under our study also showed evolutionary relationships to bacteria harboring diverse hosts (niches) ranging from termites to earthworms (ESI, Fig. S4\u2021). Taken together, our study reveals a unique aspect of plant-endophyte communication where only the bark endophytic bacterial community of a selected M. serrata plant had coevolved a means to produce maytansine jointly with the host plant, including trafficking of the precursors from and to the host plant. In other M. serrata plants where this endophytic community is absent, there is no production of maytansine, as exempli\ue103ed not only by the Ghanaian M. serrata plant but also other Maytenus plants of different origin presently under our investigation (data not shown). Our results provide a scienti\ue103c handle to delve into further details of plant-endophyte communication not only on the transcriptome level but also the metabolome level to pinpoint regulation of host-endophyte communication. Our study further opens avenues to determine qualitative and quantitative pattern of localization and traf-\ue103cking of endophytes with regard to shared biosynthesis of maytansine.
