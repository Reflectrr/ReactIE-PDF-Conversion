Enzymatic halogenation through oxidative mechanisms is the most common route to these metabolites, though direct halogenation via halide anion incorporation is also known to proceed through both enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of these transformations, highlight applications of this knowledge, and propose future opportunities and challenges for the field. Introduction Compounds containing carbon\u2013halogen bonds constitute a diverse group of natural products that display a wide range of biological activities, including anticancer and antibiotic proper-ties. Over 4000 halogenated products have been isolated from natural sources (Gribble, 2004). Chlorination is the predominant modification, followed by bromination, while iodination and fluo-rination are rare in Nature. Examples of halogenated natural products include the remarkably potent anticancer agents b-lactone salinosporamide A, macrocyclic lactone polyether spongistatin, indolocarbazole rebeccamycin, and enediyne calicheamicin g1 I, and a number of antibiotics, such as vancomy-cin, chlortetracycline, and chloramphenicol (Fenical and Jensen, 2006; Gribble, 1998, 2004; Nicolaou et al., 1993). The presence of halogen substituents in many natural prod-ucts profoundly influences their biological activity (Figure 1). For example, two chlorine substituents in vancomycin, the anti-biotic of last resort for the treatment of multiple-drug resistant S. aureus infections, are required to achieve the clinically active conformation of this antibiotic through the control of atropisomer distribution (Harris et al., 1985). The therapeutic efficacy of sali-nosporamide A, a proteasome inhibitor currently in clinical trials for multiple myeloma treatment, requires the presence of a chlo-rine substituent. Addition of the hydroxyl moiety of the protea-some\u2019s active site threonine into the lactone of salinosporamide leads to opening of the b-lactone and release of the free hydroxyl group in this molecule. This nucleophilic hydroxyl, capable of reforming the lactone and releasing the inhibitor, instead reacts in an intramolecular fashion to displace the primary chloride sub-stituent and form a tetrahydrofuran ring (Groll et al., 2006). The two-reaction sequence provides for an irreversible covalent inhi-bition and underlies the potency of this anticancer agent. The presence of a chloride substituent is also relevant for the biolog-ical activity of rebeccamycin: in contrast to rebeccamycin, its deschloro derivatives lack antimicrobial activity (Rodrigues Pereira et al., 1996). Similarly, the halogenated sesterterpenes neomangicol A and B show in vitro cytotoxic effect toward HCT-116 human colon tumor cell line, while their nonhaloge-nated analog neomangicol C was inactive in this assay (Renner et al., 1998). Chemistry & Given the vital role that halogens can play in determining the biological activity of secondary metabolites, their biosynthesis has been a topic of study for over 40 years. In the last decade, the cloning and sequencing of biosynthetic gene clusters has revealed new chemistries for halogen incorporation and pro-vided a driving force for detailed mechanistic studies of these enzymes. A combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural characterizations has provided ever more detailed insights into the workings of these catalysts. In return, the knowl-edge gained is being used to facilitate the identification of new natural products and gene clusters while enabling the metabolic engineering of novel metabolites. Halogenation by Hypohalite, X+ The first general strategy for enzymatic halogenation is to gener-ate a reactive hypohalite species by two-electron oxidation of the corresponding halide. Consistent with the electronic deficient nature of the hypohalite, this strategy is used by Nature to haloge-nate electron-richcarbon centers innatural products.Thespecific oxidant distinguishes the two broad classes of halogenating enzymes. Hydrogen peroxide is used by the haloperoxidase class,whereas molecular oxygen is used by the halogenase class. Heme-Fe Haloperoxidases The first halogenating enzyme to be characterized, chloroperox-idase (CPO) from Caldariomyces fumago, serves as the proto-typical heme-iron haloperoxidase. The protein was isolated based on its postulated involvement in the biosynthesis of the natural product caldariomycin. CPO was shown to dichlorinate the activated carbon of 1,3-cyclopentanedione and halogenate other electron rich carbons including the b-carbon of dimedone and the 3-and 5-positions of the amino acid tyrosine (Hager et al., 1966). CPO also catalyzes a host of related reactions, including oxidation of iodide to iodine, sulfoxidation of dialkyl sulfides, P450-like insertion of oxygen into C\u2013H s-bonds and C\u2013C p-bonds, and catalase-like disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water (van Rantwijk and Sheldon, 2000). This broad range of chemistry coupled with the protein\u2019s stability have made it of interest for commercial applications. The proposed mechanism for halogenation (Figure 2A) involves the initial binding of peroxide at the axial position of Biology 15, February 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 99 Chemistry & Biology Review the resting FeIII\u2013porphyrin complex. Water is eliminated to give an intermediate FeIV\u2013oxo species known as compound I which is then intercepted by halide to form a FeIII\u2013hypohalite species. Halogenation of the organic substrate can proceed directly from this compound, or alternatively free hypohalous acid can be re-leased and perform the actual halogenation more distant from the Fe center. Given the acidic conditions in which CPO works best and the general lack of substrate specificity, it is widely believed that free hypohalous acid is the dominant halogenating agent. Structurally, CPO appears to blend characteristics of the cytochrome P450 enzymes and heme peroxidases. Spectro-scopic (Dawson and Sono, 1987) and structural studies (Sundar-amoorthy et al., 1995) confirmed that, as in P450s, the proximal axial ligand to the catalytic iron is thiolate derived from a cysteine side chain. The distal binding pocket is more reminiscent of heme peroxidases in that it is composed primarily of polar amino acid side chains. Partially occupied binding sites for bromide and iodide were found near a channel from the protein\u2019s surface to the Fe center, and these may provide transient sites to guide the halide ion to the catalytic center. When the substrate 1,3-cyclopentanedione was soaked in at high concentrations, the compound was observed to bind directly above the heme center. Unfortunately, the orientation of the substrate and its too-close proximity to the active site suggest that the observed interaction is not productive for catalytic purposes. Vanadium-Dependent Haloperoxidases Studies of halogenation in marine natural products identified a second subclass of haloperoxidases that contained vanadium as the necessary cofactor. These vanadium-dependent haloper-oxidases (V-HPO) are thought to be responsible for the vast majority of halogenation events in marine natural products. Vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases (V-BPO) are widely distributed throughout marine seaweeds (Butler and Carter-Franklin, 2004) while the vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidases Figure 1. Representative Natural Products with Halogen-Dependent Chemistry & Biology Review (V-CPO) have only been found in terrestrial fungi and in two bac-terial species (Winter et al., 2007). Like the heme-iron haloperoxidases, the metal center of V-HPO binds hydrogen peroxide and activates it for attack by halide (Figure 2B). However, the vanadium atom does not appear to be redox active, instead maintaining its V(V) oxidation state throughout the catalytic cycle. Peroxide binds to provide an acti-vated h2-peroxo intermediate, whereupon bromide reacts to form vanadium-bound hypobromite. Again, it is not clear if this bound intermediate is the active oxidizing agent, or if hypobro-mous acid is released from the metal center before bromination occurs. Structural studies of V-BPO (Isupov et al., 2000; Weyand et al., 1999) and V-CPO (Messerschmidt and Wever, 1996) show large differences in the overall structure, but a highly similar active site that supports the proposed mechanism. The vanadate ion sits at the bottom of a wide substrate funnel and is coordinated to the protein via a conserved histidine residue. When cocrystal-lized with azide\u2014a known inhibitor of V-CPO\u2014 the ion displaces the water opposite the histidine suggesting this is the site of initial coordination of peroxide (Messerschmidt and Wever, 1996). The reactions catalyzed by V-HPO generally proceed through halonium intermediates. Complex molecules can be formed when the initial halonium ion is intercepted by intramolecular nucleophiles including hydroxyl groups and p-bonds. Recently, three genes with homology to vanadium-dependent chloroperox-idases were found in the napyradiomycin gene cluster of Strepto-Figure 3. Chemistry of Flavin-Dependent Chemistry & Biology Review demonstrates the exquisite selectivity characteristicof thisclass of halogenases. Amino acids are also known to be halogenated when bound to the peptidyl carrier proteins found in nonribosomal peptide synthase assembly lines. In the biosynthesis of pyoluteorin, thiolation domain-bound proline (prolyl-S-PltL) is oxidized to pyrrolyl-S-PltL (Thomas et al., 2002). This electron-rich aromatic variant is then doubly chlorinated at C5 and C4 by the halogen-ase PltA (Dorrestein et al., 2005). SgcC3 was recently shown to catalyze the selective chlorination of the C3 position of b-tyro-syl-S-SgcC2 during the biosynthesis of the enediyne antibiotic C-1027 (Lin et al., 2007). A series of structural, spectroscopic, and biochemical studies has helped to refine the proposed mechanism for flavin halo-genases (Figure 3B). The crystal structures of PrnA (Dong et al., 2005) and RebH (Yeh et al., 2007) show the expected flavin bind-ing domain with a chloride ion bound in a pocket on the solvent-protected face of the cofactor. This binding module is similar to those in known flavin monooxygenases and initial reaction of reduced flavin with molecular oxygen is thought to proceed via the same mechanism to provide a flavin hydroperoxide (FAD-C4a-OOH) intermediate (Entsch and van Berkel, 1995). The struc-ture also shows that the tryptophan binding pocket is located 10A\u030a away from the flavin cofactor with only a narrow channel connect-ing the two sites, excluding direct interaction between the substrate and oxidized flavin (either FAD-C4a-OOH or FAD-C4a-OCl). Instead it is proposed that chloride attack on the distal oxygen of FAD-C4a-OOH produces enzyme-trapped HOCl that can diffuse toward the substrate binding site. Spectroscopic and kinetic studies of RebH (Yeh et al., 2006) support this view by showing that flavin redox chemistry is complete before sub-strate halogenation. Furthermore, the redox chemistry can occur in the absence of substrate proving that chloride oxidation by fla-vin and substrate oxidation are uncoupled processes. While free hypohalous acid would be a powerful enough oxidant to perform the observed reactions, it is also known to react with chemical functionalities within proteins. In addressing this ques-tion of how flavin-dependent halogenases control this reactive species toachieve selective substrate halogenation, itwas discov-ered that the competent oxidizing species in the reaction has a half-life of 28 hr (Yeh et al., 2007). When Na36Cl was used as the chlorine source, the radiolabel was found to move sequentially from chloride to protein to product. These data suggest the forma-tion of a covalent adduct between the protein and chlorine. Based on the known reactivity of lysine sidechains with hypochlorous acid (Nightingale et al., 2000) and the strategic location of a con-served lysine residue at the interface of the channel and substrate pocket, it is proposed that Lys79 first reacts with the flavin-gener-ated acid to produce a lysine chloramine species. With its attenu-ated reactivity, the lysine chloramine is better suited to perform the regioselective halogenation of the substrate. Thus, it appears that Naturecovalentlycapturesan indiscriminatehalogenating reagent (hypochlorous acid) within the protein to provide a less reactive but more selective reagent (lysine chloramine) for the halogenation of the substrate. Halogenation via Halogen, XNone Identificationof several halogenated naturalproducts, suchas the trichlorinated marine molluscicide barbamide, produced by cya-102 Chemistry & Biology 15, February 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Ltd All r nobacterium Lyngbya majuscula (Orjala and Gerwick, 1996), and Streptomyces armentosus-derived antibiotic armentomycin (Argoudelis et al., 1967), revealed chlorine incorporation at unac-tivated carbon centers. Such carbons are not amenable to mod-ification by electrophilic agents, suggesting an entirely different mechanism for carbon\u2013halogen bond formation. A radical mech-anism of chlorination was proposed to account for the regio-and stereoselective conversion of pro-R methyl group of L-leucine to the trichloromethyl moiety of barbamide (Hartung, 1999; Sita-chitta et al., 1998). Recently, in vitro reconstitution and elucidation of the mechanistic logic for halogenases capable of chlorinating unactivated carbon centers has been achieved. Mononuclear non-heme iron halogenases are imbedded in nonribosomal pep-tide synthetase assembly lines, and act on the methyl groups of thiolation domain-tethered amino acids (Figure 4A). Chlorination of the methyl group of SyrB1-bound L-threonine in the biosynthe-sis of the lipo-nonapeptidolactone syringomycin E is carried out by a member of this class of enzymes, SyrB2 (Vaillancourt et al., 2005b). Similarly, the halogenase CytC3 adds two chlorine atoms to the terminal methyl group of L-2-aminobutyric acid (Aba) teth-ered to thiolation domain CytC2 in biosynthesis of armentomycin by soil Streptomyces sp. RK95-74 (Ueki et al., 2006). In vitro re-constitution of the trichlorination event in barbamide biosynthesis requires two halogenating enzymes, BarB1 and BarB2, which act on L-Leu-S-BarA as a substrate (Galonic et al., 2006). Detailed evaluation of cofactor requirements established that ferrous iron, a-ketoglutarate (aKG), chloride, and oxygen are required for enzymatic activity (Vaillancourt et al., 2005b), evok-ing similarity with Fe(II)-and aKG-dependent dioxygenases. To coordinate iron, dioxygenases of this class utilize aKG and three protein residues, two histidine and one carboxylate (Asp or Glu), in a characteristic His-x-Asp/Glu-xn-His \u2018\u2018facial triad\u2019\u2019 sequence (Costas et al., 2004; Hausinger, 2004; Que, 2000). A key catalytic intermediate in the hydroxylation reaction is an Fe(IV)\u2013oxo spe-cies that abstracts hydrogen atom from the substrate to form a substrate radical and an Fe(III)-OH species (Bollinger et al., 2005; Hoffart et al., 2006). Subsequent transfer of the hydroxyl group to the substrate radical\u2014\u2018\u2018oxygen rebound\u2019\u2019\u2014results in the formation of an alcohol product. The X-ray crystal structure of syringomycin halogenase SyrB2 shows that, in contrast to di-oxygenases, the active site iron is coordinated by two protein-derived histidine ligands (Blasiak et al., 2006). The carboxylate residue is replaced by chloride, coordinated to iron opposite to the C2 carbonyl moiety of aKG. In the primary sequence of SyrB2, the conserved carboxylate of dioxygenases is replaced by an alanine, resulting in His-x-Ala-xn-His motif. Sequence alignment of known mononuclear non-heme iron halogenases indeed confirms the presence of a conserved, sterically unde-manding residue, such as Ala or Gly. The loss of the carboxylate ligand and its replacement by exogenous halide is likely crucial to the enzyme\u2019s ability to bind and subsequently transfer halide to organic substrate. To evaluate if substrate activation proceeds through an analo-gous Fe(IV)\u2013oxo species, direct characterization of intermedi-ates was carried out for the CytC3-catalyzed chlorination of L-Aba-S-CytC2 (Figure 4B; Galonic et al., 2007). When the starting CytC3-Fe(II)-aKG-Cl-L-Aba-S-CytC2 complex was reacted with oxygen, accumulation of an intermediate state with absorption feature characteristic of Fe(IV)\u2013oxo intermediate ights reserved Chemistry & Biology Review in dioxygenases was detected. Subsequent characterization of the intermediate state using freeze-quench (FQ) Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy revealed that it consists of two rapidly equilibrat-ing high-spin Fe(IV)\u2013oxo species. To determine if these species, in analogy to iron\u2013oxo intermediates in dioxygenases, abstract hydrogen atom from the substrate, d3-L-Aba-S-CytC2 was pre-pared and subjected to spectroscopic analysis. Observed accu-mulation of the intermediate state, as a result of a kinetic isotope effect, suggests that the iron\u2013oxo complexes in halogenases catalyze C\u2013H cleavage reaction to initiate substrate halogena-tion. To obtain insight into the structure of the halogenation intermediate, FQ Mo\u0308ssbauer and X-ray absorption studies were performed on an intermediate trapped in the reaction of CytC3-Fe(II)-aKG-Br-L-Aba-S-CytC2 complex with dioxygen (Fujimori et al., 2007a). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) allowed for determination of iron\u2013 bromide bond length in both control samples (2.53 A\u030a) and the intermediate state obtained upon mixing with oxygen (2.43 A\u030a). In addition, the intermediate also displayed a short iron\u2013oxo interaction (1.62 A\u030a), assigned to Fe(IV)\u2013oxo species. The obtained structural insights provide validation for the ligation of halide to iron at the Fe(IV) intermediate stage of the catalytic cycle and additional evidence for short iron\u2013oxo interaction. Thus, binding of dioxygen to Fe(II) in halogenases leads to the formation of Cl-Fe(IV)\u2013oxo species which activate the substrate for halogenation via hydrogen atom abstraction to form sub-strate radical and Cl-Fe(III)-OH intermediate. Figure 4. Chemistry of Fe(II)/aKG-Chemistry & Biology Review Halogenation via Halide, XNone The final mechanism of halogen incorporation is via the common halide oxidation state. Fluoride, chloride and bromide are wide-spread in the earth\u2019s crust and marine environments (Murphy, 2003; van Pee, 1996), but their direct incorporation into natural product scaffolds is rare and accounts for a small subset of halogenated metabolites. Nonetheless, two entirely different mechanisms for halide incorporation into secondary metabo-lites\u2014one enzymatic, one nonenzymatic\u2014have been described in the literature. Each system provides intriguing insights into the reactivity of halides in Nature. A well-studied example of a halogenase that incorporates fluoride anion is the fluorinase from Streptomyces cattleya (O\u2019Hagan et al., 2002). This enzyme transfers fluoride anion to the electrophilic 50 carbon atom of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) substrate to generate 5-fluoroadenosine, which is then metabolized in a series of reactions to generate fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine. The crystal structure of fluorinase reveals that the enzyme is a hexamer, with the active site positioned at the interface of two monomer units (Dong et al., 2004). The extensive contacts between SAM and the protein suggest the crucial importance of substrate recognition and positioning for efficient catalysis. Interestingly, the ribose ring of SAM is bound in a high-energy conformation which is postulated to weaken the C50\u2013S bond and provide an optimal trajectory for the nucleophilic substitution reaction. The fluoride ion must also be carefully prepared by the enzyme for catalysis. Because fluoride\u2019s nucle-ophilicity is greatly diminished by hydrogen bonding to water, the enzyme must provide a binding pocket that can desolvate the ion but still provide sufficient stabilizing interactions. Struc-tural, thermodynamic, and kinetic studies of the native and mu-tant proteins suggest that initial desolvation is accomplished by exchanging two water molecules for an active site serine side-chain and the backbone amide N\u2013H of the same residue (Zhu et al., 2007). Subsequent binding of SAM provides the main Figure 5. Halogenation of Natural Products Chemistry & Biology Review model studies on halogenation of the 10-membered enediyne cyclodeca-1,5-diyn-3-ene confirmed the feasibility of the pro-posal (Perrin et al., 2007). Slight heating of this molecule in the presence of a lithium halide and weak acid result in the formation of 1-halotetrahydronaphthalenes. Kinetic dissection of the re-action mechanism showed that the rate-limiting step is the for-mation of the p-benzyne intermediate, which results from the Bergman cyclization of the precursor. This intermediate is pro-posed to undergo an unprecedented reaction in which chloride adds to p-benzyne to give chlorine and an electron pair in a 1,4 arrangement (Figure 5C). Subsequent protonation of the aromatic ring provides the observed monohalogenated prod-ucts. This halide addition\u2013protonation sequence invokes unusual chemistry yet provides a simple explanation for why 1,4-dihalogenated sporolides have not been isolated. Accounting for New Functional Groups A number of unique halogen-containing functional groups cannot be readily explained by systems already characterized. Further studies of these should shed new light on the scope of biological halogenation. The jamaicamide family of natural products exhibits unusual alkenyl-and alkynyl-halogenations and two predicted halo-genases (one FADH-dependent, one non-heme-iron dependent) have been found in the biosynthetic gene cluster (Edwards et al., 2004). The vinyl chloride functionality is present at a b-methyl branch along the backbone of the molecule. One hypothesis for its formation has been put forward (Vaillancourt et al., 2006), whereby the b-methyl branch is installed according to a known mechanism (Calderone et al., 2007) to give an a,b-Figure 6. New Opportunities for Enzymatic Chemistry & Biology Review Figure 7. Alternative Strategies for Halogenase-Based Discovery Chemistry & Biology Review flavoprotein halogenases KtzQ and KtzR could be involved in chlorination of electron-rich indole moiety of tryptophan and g-carbon of g,d-dehydropiperazate. KtzD, homologous to mononuclear non-heme-iron halogenases, could be involved in the biosynthesis of methylcyclopropyl glycine moiety. It is postu-lated that this putative halogenase can chlorinate d-methyl group of KtzC-bound Ile or allo-Ile. The formed d-chloro-(allo-)Ile-S-KtzC could then be a substrate for KtzA, a protein homologous to acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-like proteins. Thioester facilitated abstraction of the a-proton, followed by the removal of the b-hydride by the oxidized form of the flavin cofactor, would form an enamine species which could act as an intramolecular nucle-ophile to displace chloride and form the cyclopropane. The resulting imine species could be reduced in turn by the dihydro-flavin cofactor to provide the tethered amino acid in the correct oxidation state. This proposed mode of enzymatic cyclopropane formation awaits biochemical characterization. Prospects for Metabolic Engineering An important goal for the field of biosynthesis is the rational engineering of new metabolites using combinations of enzymes from distinct biosynthetic pathways. Such efforts could lead to therapeutics with enhanced potency, optimized pharmacoki-netic properties, or altogether novel mechanisms. The applica-tion of halogenating enzymes presents significant challenges in this area. The haloperoxidase enzymes generally exhibit a broad substrate scope that could potentially allow them to be shuffled between pathways. However, this could come at the expense of selectivity making it difficult to predict or control the outcome of the reactions. The non-heme-iron and flavin halogenases offer more selec-tivity in their chemical transformations, but potentially at the expense of portability. An early success in their application to metabolic engineering was presented by Sanchez et al. (San-chez et al., 2005, 2006). By enlisting tryptophan halogenases with differing regioselectivities, they were successful in engi-neering the biosynthesis of analogs of rebeccamycin and the related indolocarbazole staurosporine. In their work, the en-zymes responsible for the indolocarbazole core structures were cloned into an actinomycete host along with combinations of tailoring enzymes. RebH, the endogenous halogenase responsible for 7-chlorotryptophan formation, was replaced with either ThaI or PyrH which generate 6-and 5-chlorotrypto-phan, respectively. Such swaps were successful in producing novel patterns of halogenation around the indolocarbazole core. Moving forward, it will be necessary to identify new halo-genases and carefully assess their substrate specificity and product selectivity to identify those best suited for combinatorial applications. For metabolites biosynthesized on assembly lines, additional understanding of the protein\u2013protein interactions will also be needed in order to realize the full potential of metabolic engineering. Concluding Remarks The halogenation of natural product scaffolds allows organisms to optimize the bioactivity of small molecules for evolutionary advantage. Nature has adopted a wide variety of chemistries to perform this task, the particular mechanism being matched to the electronics of the substrate. The more common one-Chemistry & B and two-electron oxidation of halides are targeted to unactivated and nucleophilic substrates, respectively. In special circum-stances, Nature also takes advantage of direct halide incorpora-tion to halogenate electrophilic sites. Through a variety of exper-imental approaches, the details of these mechanisms have become increasingly clear, and this knowledge is now being used to drive the discovery of new natural products and their gene clusters, as well as the metabolic engineering of new metabolites.

        "Halogenation is a frequent modification of secondary metabolites and can play a significant role in establish-ing the bioactivity of a compound. Enzymatic halogenation through oxidative mechanisms is the most common route to these metabolites, though direct halogenation via halide anion incorporation is also known to proceed through both enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of these transformations, highlight applications of this knowledge, and propose future opportunities and challenges for the field.",
        "Introduction Compounds containing carbon\u2013halogen bonds constitute a diverse group of natural products that display a wide range of biological activities, including anticancer and antibiotic proper-ties. Over 4000 halogenated products have been isolated from natural sources (Gribble, 2004). Chlorination is the predominant modification, followed by bromination, while iodination and fluo-rination are rare in Nature. Examples of halogenated natural products include the remarkably potent anticancer agents b-lactone salinosporamide A, macrocyclic lactone polyether spongistatin, indolocarbazole rebeccamycin, and enediyne calicheamicin g1 I, and a number of antibiotics, such as vancomy-cin, chlortetracycline, and chloramphenicol (Fenical and Jensen, 2006; Gribble, 1998, 2004; Nicolaou et al., 1993).",
        "The presence of halogen substituents in many natural prod-ucts profoundly influences their biological activity (Figure 1). For example, two chlorine substituents in vancomycin, the anti-biotic of last resort for the treatment of multiple-drug resistant S. aureus infections, are required to achieve the clinically active conformation of this antibiotic through the control of atropisomer distribution (Harris et al., 1985). The therapeutic efficacy of sali-nosporamide A, a proteasome inhibitor currently in clinical trials for multiple myeloma treatment, requires the presence of a chlo-rine substituent. Addition of the hydroxyl moiety of the protea-some\u2019s active site threonine into the lactone of salinosporamide leads to opening of the b-lactone and release of the free hydroxyl group in this molecule. This nucleophilic hydroxyl, capable of reforming the lactone and releasing the inhibitor, instead reacts in an intramolecular fashion to displace the primary chloride sub-stituent and form a tetrahydrofuran ring (Groll et al., 2006). The two-reaction sequence provides for an irreversible covalent inhi-bition and underlies the potency of this anticancer agent. The presence of a chloride substituent is also relevant for the biolog-ical activity of rebeccamycin: in contrast to rebeccamycin, its deschloro derivatives lack antimicrobial activity (Rodrigues Pereira et al., 1996). Similarly, the halogenated sesterterpenes neomangicol A and B show in vitro cytotoxic effect toward HCT-116 human colon tumor cell line, while their nonhaloge-nated analog neomangicol C was inactive in this assay (Renner et al., 1998).",

        "Given the vital role that halogens can play in determining the biological activity of secondary metabolites, their biosynthesis has been a topic of study for over 40 years. In the last decade, the cloning and sequencing of biosynthetic gene clusters has revealed new chemistries for halogen incorporation and pro-vided a driving force for detailed mechanistic studies of these enzymes. A combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural characterizations has provided ever more detailed insights into the workings of these catalysts. In return, the knowl-edge gained is being used to facilitate the identification of new natural products and gene clusters while enabling the metabolic engineering of novel metabolites.",
        "Halogenation by Hypohalite, X+ The first general strategy for enzymatic halogenation is to gener-ate a reactive hypohalite species by two-electron oxidation of the corresponding halide. Consistent with the electronic deficient nature of the hypohalite, this strategy is used by Nature to haloge-nate electron-richcarbon centers innatural products.Thespecific oxidant distinguishes the two broad classes of halogenating enzymes. Hydrogen peroxide is used by the haloperoxidase class,whereas molecular oxygen is used by the halogenase class. Heme-Fe Haloperoxidases The first halogenating enzyme to be characterized, chloroperox-idase (CPO) from Caldariomyces fumago, serves as the proto-typical heme-iron haloperoxidase. The protein was isolated based on its postulated involvement in the biosynthesis of the natural product caldariomycin. CPO was shown to dichlorinate the activated carbon of 1,3-cyclopentanedione and halogenate other electron rich carbons including the b-carbon of dimedone and the 3-and 5-positions of the amino acid tyrosine (Hager et al., 1966). CPO also catalyzes a host of related reactions, including oxidation of iodide to iodine, sulfoxidation of dialkyl sulfides, P450-like insertion of oxygen into C\u2013H s-bonds and C\u2013C p-bonds, and catalase-like disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water (van Rantwijk and Sheldon, 2000). This broad range of chemistry coupled with the protein\u2019s stability have made it of interest for commercial applications. The proposed mechanism for halogenation (Figure 2A) involves the initial binding of peroxide at the axial position of Biology 15, February 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 99",

        "the resting FeIII\u2013porphyrin complex. Water is eliminated to give an intermediate FeIV\u2013oxo species known as compound I which is then intercepted by halide to form a FeIII\u2013hypohalite species. Halogenation of the organic substrate can proceed directly from this compound, or alternatively free hypohalous acid can be re-leased and perform the actual halogenation more distant from the Fe center. Given the acidic conditions in which CPO works best and the general lack of substrate specificity, it is widely believed that free hypohalous acid is the dominant halogenating agent.",
        "Structurally, CPO appears to blend characteristics of the cytochrome P450 enzymes and heme peroxidases. Spectro-scopic (Dawson and Sono, 1987) and structural studies (Sundar-amoorthy et al., 1995) confirmed that, as in P450s, the proximal axial ligand to the catalytic iron is thiolate derived from a cysteine side chain. The distal binding pocket is more reminiscent of heme peroxidases in that it is composed primarily of polar amino acid side chains. Partially occupied binding sites for bromide and iodide were found near a channel from the protein\u2019s surface to the Fe center, and these may provide transient sites to guide the halide ion to the catalytic center. When the substrate 1,3-cyclopentanedione was soaked in at high concentrations, the compound was observed to bind directly above the heme center. Unfortunately, the orientation of the substrate and its too-close proximity to the active site suggest that the observed interaction is not productive for catalytic purposes. Vanadium-Dependent Haloperoxidases Studies of halogenation in marine natural products identified a second subclass of haloperoxidases that contained vanadium as the necessary cofactor. These vanadium-dependent haloper-oxidases (V-HPO) are thought to be responsible for the vast majority of halogenation events in marine natural products. Vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases (V-BPO) are widely distributed throughout marine seaweeds (Butler and Carter-Franklin, 2004) while the vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidases",

        "(V-CPO) have only been found in terrestrial fungi and in two bac-terial species (Winter et al., 2007).",
        "Like the heme-iron haloperoxidases, the metal center of V-HPO binds hydrogen peroxide and activates it for attack by halide (Figure 2B). However, the vanadium atom does not appear to be redox active, instead maintaining its V(V) oxidation state throughout the catalytic cycle. Peroxide binds to provide an acti-vated h2-peroxo intermediate, whereupon bromide reacts to form vanadium-bound hypobromite. Again, it is not clear if this bound intermediate is the active oxidizing agent, or if hypobro-mous acid is released from the metal center before bromination occurs. Structural studies of V-BPO (Isupov et al., 2000; Weyand et al., 1999) and V-CPO (Messerschmidt and Wever, 1996) show large differences in the overall structure, but a highly similar active site that supports the proposed mechanism. The vanadate ion sits at the bottom of a wide substrate funnel and is coordinated to the protein via a conserved histidine residue. When cocrystal-lized with azide\u2014a known inhibitor of V-CPO\u2014 the ion displaces the water opposite the histidine suggesting this is the site of initial coordination of peroxide (Messerschmidt and Wever, 1996).",
        "The reactions catalyzed by V-HPO generally proceed through halonium intermediates. Complex molecules can be formed when the initial halonium ion is intercepted by intramolecular nucleophiles including hydroxyl groups and p-bonds. Recently, three genes with homology to vanadium-dependent chloroperox-idases were found in the napyradiomycin gene cluster of Strepto-",

        "to the peptidyl carrier proteins found in nonribosomal peptide synthase assembly lines. In the biosynthesis of pyoluteorin, thiolation domain-bound proline (prolyl-S-PltL) is oxidized to pyrrolyl-S-PltL (Thomas et al., 2002). This electron-rich aromatic variant is then doubly chlorinated at C5 and C4 by the halogen-ase PltA (Dorrestein et al., 2005). SgcC3 was recently shown to catalyze the selective chlorination of the C3 position of b-tyro-syl-S-SgcC2 during the biosynthesis of the enediyne antibiotic C-1027 (Lin et al., 2007). A series of structural, spectroscopic, and biochemical studies",
        "has helped to refine the proposed mechanism for flavin halo-genases (Figure 3B). The crystal structures of PrnA (Dong et al., 2005) and RebH (Yeh et al., 2007) show the expected flavin bind-ing domain with a chloride ion bound in a pocket on the solvent-protected face of the cofactor. This binding module is similar to those in known flavin monooxygenases and initial reaction of reduced flavin with molecular oxygen is thought to proceed via the same mechanism to provide a flavin hydroperoxide (FAD-C4a-OOH) intermediate (Entsch and van Berkel, 1995). The struc-ture also shows that the tryptophan binding pocket is located 10A\u030a away from the flavin cofactor with only a narrow channel connect-ing the two sites, excluding direct interaction between the substrate and oxidized flavin (either FAD-C4a-OOH or FAD-C4a-OCl). Instead it is proposed that chloride attack on the distal oxygen of FAD-C4a-OOH produces enzyme-trapped HOCl that can diffuse toward the substrate binding site. Spectroscopic and kinetic studies of RebH (Yeh et al., 2006) support this view by showing that flavin redox chemistry is complete before sub-strate halogenation. Furthermore, the redox chemistry can occur in the absence of substrate proving that chloride oxidation by fla-vin and substrate oxidation are uncoupled processes. While free hypohalous acid would be a powerful enough oxidant",
        "to perform the observed reactions, it is also known to react with chemical functionalities within proteins. In addressing this ques-tion of how flavin-dependent halogenases control this reactive species toachieve selective substrate halogenation, itwas discov-ered that the competent oxidizing species in the reaction has a half-life of 28 hr (Yeh et al., 2007). When Na36Cl was used as the chlorine source, the radiolabel was found to move sequentially from chloride to protein to product. These data suggest the forma-tion of a covalent adduct between the protein and chlorine. Based on the known reactivity of lysine sidechains with hypochlorous acid (Nightingale et al., 2000) and the strategic location of a con-served lysine residue at the interface of the channel and substrate pocket, it is proposed that Lys79 first reacts with the flavin-gener-ated acid to produce a lysine chloramine species. With its attenu-ated reactivity, the lysine chloramine is better suited to perform the regioselective halogenation of the substrate.

Such carbons are not amenable to mod-ification by electrophilic agents, suggesting an entirely different mechanism for carbon\u2013halogen bond formation. A radical mech-anism of chlorination was proposed to account for the regio-and stereoselective conversion of pro-R methyl group of L-leucine to the trichloromethyl moiety of barbamide (Hartung, 1999; Sita-chitta et al., 1998). Recently, in vitro reconstitution and elucidation of the mechanistic logic for halogenases capable of chlorinating unactivated carbon centers has been achieved. Mononuclear non-heme iron halogenases are imbedded in nonribosomal pep-tide synthetase assembly lines, and act on the methyl groups of thiolation domain-tethered amino acids (Figure 4A). Chlorination of the methyl group of SyrB1-bound L-threonine in the biosynthe-sis of the lipo-nonapeptidolactone syringomycin E is carried out by a member of this class of enzymes, SyrB2 (Vaillancourt et al., 2005b). Similarly, the halogenase CytC3 adds two chlorine atoms to the terminal methyl group of L-2-aminobutyric acid (Aba) teth-ered to thiolation domain CytC2 in biosynthesis of armentomycin by soil Streptomyces sp. RK95-74 (Ueki et al., 2006). In vitro re-constitution of the trichlorination event in barbamide biosynthesis requires two halogenating enzymes, BarB1 and BarB2, which act on L-Leu-S-BarA as a substrate (Galonic et al., 2006).",
        "Detailed evaluation of cofactor requirements established that ferrous iron, a-ketoglutarate (aKG), chloride, and oxygen are required for enzymatic activity (Vaillancourt et al., 2005b), evok-ing similarity with Fe(II)-and aKG-dependent dioxygenases. To coordinate iron, dioxygenases of this class utilize aKG and three protein residues, two histidine and one carboxylate (Asp or Glu), in a characteristic His-x-Asp/Glu-xn-His \u2018\u2018facial triad\u2019\u2019 sequence (Costas et al., 2004; Hausinger, 2004; Que, 2000). A key catalytic intermediate in the hydroxylation reaction is an Fe(IV)\u2013oxo spe-cies that abstracts hydrogen atom from the substrate to form a substrate radical and an Fe(III)-OH species (Bollinger et al., 2005; Hoffart et al., 2006). Subsequent transfer of the hydroxyl group to the substrate radical\u2014\u2018\u2018oxygen rebound\u2019\u2019\u2014results in the formation of an alcohol product. The X-ray crystal structure of syringomycin halogenase SyrB2 shows that, in contrast to di-oxygenases, the active site iron is coordinated by two protein-derived histidine ligands (Blasiak et al., 2006). The carboxylate residue is replaced by chloride, coordinated to iron opposite to the C2 carbonyl moiety of aKG. In the primary sequence of SyrB2, the conserved carboxylate of dioxygenases is replaced by an alanine, resulting in His-x-Ala-xn-His motif. Sequence alignment of known mononuclear non-heme iron halogenases indeed confirms the presence of a conserved, sterically unde-manding residue, such as Ala or Gly. The loss of the carboxylate ligand and its replacement by exogenous halide is likely crucial to the enzyme\u2019s ability to bind and subsequently transfer halide to organic substrate.",
        "To evaluate if substrate activation proceeds through an analo-gous Fe(IV)\u2013oxo species, direct characterization of intermedi-ates was carried out for the CytC3-catalyzed chlorination of L-Aba-S-CytC2 (Figure 4B; Galonic et al., 2007).

        "in dioxygenases was detected. Subsequent characterization of the intermediate state using freeze-quench (FQ) Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy revealed that it consists of two rapidly equilibrat-ing high-spin Fe(IV)\u2013oxo species. To determine if these species, in analogy to iron\u2013oxo intermediates in dioxygenases, abstract hydrogen atom from the substrate, d3-L-Aba-S-CytC2 was pre-pared and subjected to spectroscopic analysis. Observed accu-mulation of the intermediate state, as a result of a kinetic isotope effect, suggests that the iron\u2013oxo complexes in halogenases catalyze C\u2013H cleavage reaction to initiate substrate halogena-tion. To obtain insight into the structure of the halogenation intermediate, FQ Mo\u0308ssbauer and X-ray absorption studies were performed on an intermediate trapped in the reaction of CytC3-Fe(II)-aKG-Br-L-Aba-S-CytC2 complex with dioxygen (Fujimori et al., 2007a). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) allowed for determination of iron\u2013 bromide bond length in both control samples (2.53 A\u030a) and the intermediate state obtained upon mixing with oxygen (2.43 A\u030a). In addition, the intermediate also displayed a short iron\u2013oxo interaction (1.62 A\u030a), assigned to Fe(IV)\u2013oxo species. The obtained structural insights provide validation for the ligation of halide to iron at the Fe(IV) intermediate stage of the catalytic cycle and additional evidence for short iron\u2013oxo interaction. Thus, binding of dioxygen to Fe(II) in halogenases leads to the formation of Cl-Fe(IV)\u2013oxo species which activate the substrate for halogenation via hydrogen atom abstraction to form sub-strate radical and Cl-Fe(III)-OH intermediate.",

        "Halogenation via Halide, XNone The final mechanism of halogen incorporation is via the common halide oxidation state. Fluoride, chloride and bromide are wide-spread in the earth\u2019s crust and marine environments (Murphy, 2003; van Pee, 1996), but their direct incorporation into natural product scaffolds is rare and accounts for a small subset of halogenated metabolites. Nonetheless, two entirely different mechanisms for halide incorporation into secondary metabo-lites\u2014one enzymatic, one nonenzymatic\u2014have been described in the literature.

        "fluoride anion is the fluorinase from Streptomyces cattleya (O\u2019Hagan et al., 2002). This enzyme transfers fluoride anion to the electrophilic 50 carbon atom of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) substrate to generate 5-fluoroadenosine, which is then metabolized in a series of reactions to generate fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine. The crystal structure of fluorinase reveals that the enzyme is a hexamer, with the active site positioned at the interface of two monomer units (Dong et al., 2004). The extensive contacts between SAM and the protein suggest the crucial importance of substrate recognition and positioning for efficient catalysis. Interestingly, the ribose ring of SAM is bound in a high-energy conformation which is postulated to weaken the C50\u2013S bond and provide an optimal trajectory for the nucleophilic substitution reaction. The fluoride ion must also be carefully prepared by the enzyme for catalysis. Because fluoride\u2019s nucle-ophilicity is greatly diminished by hydrogen bonding to water, the enzyme must provide a binding pocket that can desolvate the ion but still provide sufficient stabilizing interactions. Struc-tural, thermodynamic, and kinetic studies of the native and mu-tant proteins suggest that initial desolvation is accomplished by exchanging two water molecules for an active site serine side-chain and the backbone amide N\u2013H of the same residue (Zhu et al., 2007).

        "model studies on halogenation of the 10-membered enediyne cyclodeca-1,5-diyn-3-ene confirmed the feasibility of the pro-posal (Perrin et al., 2007). Slight heating of this molecule in the presence of a lithium halide and weak acid result in the formation of 1-halotetrahydronaphthalenes. Kinetic dissection of the re-action mechanism showed that the rate-limiting step is the for-mation of the p-benzyne intermediate, which results from the Bergman cyclization of the precursor. This intermediate is pro-posed to undergo an unprecedented reaction in which chloride adds to p-benzyne to give chlorine and an electron pair in a 1,4 arrangement (Figure 5C). Subsequent protonation of the aromatic ring provides the observed monohalogenated prod-ucts.

        "flavoprotein halogenases KtzQ and KtzR could be involved in chlorination of electron-rich indole moiety of tryptophan and g-carbon of g,d-dehydropiperazate. KtzD, homologous to mononuclear non-heme-iron halogenases, could be involved in the biosynthesis of methylcyclopropyl glycine moiety. It is postu-lated that this putative halogenase can chlorinate d-methyl group of KtzC-bound Ile or allo-Ile. The formed d-chloro-(allo-)Ile-S-KtzC could then be a substrate for KtzA, a protein homologous to acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-like proteins. Thioester facilitated abstraction of the a-proton, followed by the removal of the b-hydride by the oxidized form of the flavin cofactor, would form an enamine species which could act as an intramolecular nucle-ophile to displace chloride and form the cyclopropane. The resulting imine species could be reduced in turn by the dihydro-flavin cofactor to provide the tethered amino acid in the correct oxidation state. This proposed mode of enzymatic cyclopropane formation awaits biochemical characterization.",
        "Prospects for Metabolic Engineering An important goal for the field of biosynthesis is the rational engineering of new metabolites using combinations of enzymes from distinct biosynthetic pathways. Such efforts could lead to therapeutics with enhanced potency, optimized pharmacoki-netic properties, or altogether novel mechanisms. The applica-tion of halogenating enzymes presents significant challenges in this area. The haloperoxidase enzymes generally exhibit a broad substrate scope that could potentially allow them to be shuffled between pathways. However, this could come at the expense of selectivity making it difficult to predict or control the outcome of the reactions.",
        "The non-heme-iron and flavin halogenases offer more selec-tivity in their chemical transformations, but potentially at the expense of portability. An early success in their application to metabolic engineering was presented by Sanchez et al. (San-chez et al., 2005, 2006). By enlisting tryptophan halogenases with differing regioselectivities, they were successful in engi-neering the biosynthesis of analogs of rebeccamycin and the related indolocarbazole staurosporine. In their work, the en-zymes responsible for the indolocarbazole core structures were cloned into an actinomycete host along with combinations of tailoring enzymes. RebH, the endogenous halogenase responsible for 7-chlorotryptophan formation, was replaced with either ThaI or PyrH which generate 6-and 5-chlorotrypto-phan, respectively. Such swaps were successful in producing novel patterns of halogenation around the indolocarbazole core. Moving forward, it will be necessary to identify new halo-genases and carefully assess their substrate specificity and product selectivity to identify those best suited for combinatorial applications. For metabolites biosynthesized on assembly lines, additional understanding of the protein\u2013protein interactions will also be needed in order to realize the full potential of metabolic engineering.",
