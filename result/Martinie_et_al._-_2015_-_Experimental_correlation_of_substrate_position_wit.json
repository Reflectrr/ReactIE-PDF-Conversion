Martin Bollinger Jr.a,b, and Alexey Silakova,*aDepartment of Chemistry, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USAbDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USAAbstract The iron(II)-and 2-(oxo)glutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) oxygenases catalyze an array of challenging transformations, but how individual members of the enzyme family direct different outcomes is poorly understood. The Fe/2OG halogenase, SyrB2, chlorinates C4 of its native substrate, L-threonine appended to the carrier protein, SyrB1, but hydroxylates C5 of L-norvaline and, to a lesser extent, C4 of L-aminobutyric acid when SyrB1 presents these non-native amino acids. To test the hypothesis that positioning of the targeted carbon dictates the outcome, we defined the positions of these three substrates by measuring hyperfine couplings between substrate deuterium atoms and the stable, EPR-active iron-nitrosyl adduct, a surrogate for reaction intermediates. The Fe-2H distances and N-Fe-2H angles, which vary from 4.2 \u00c5 and 85\u00b0 for threonine to 3.4 \u00c5 and 65\u00b0 for norvaline, rationalize the trends in reactivity. This experimental correlation of position to outcome should aid in judging from structural data on other Fe/2OG enzymes whether they suppress hydroxylation or form hydroxylated intermediates on the pathways to other outcomes.Introduction Mononuclear1\u20134 and dinuclear1,5,6 non-heme iron enzymes, cytochromes P450,7 and radical SAM enzymes8,9 activate and functionalize inert C-H bonds with a remarkable degree of specificity and selectivity. Members of the iron-and 2-(oxo)glutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) oxygenase family catalyze a variety of transformations at unactivated carbon centers, including hydroxylation, desaturation, cyclization, stereoinversion, and halogenation; these reactions play crucial roles in microbial metabolism and biosynthesis,2 as well as oxygen and body mass homeostasis,10\u201312 DNA repair,13\u201315 epigenetic inheritance, and control of transcription in humans.16\u201318 The mechanistic strategy employed by this family was first elucidated in the hydroxylases.4 These enzymes activate oxygen at their common Fe(II) Copyright \u00a9 American Chemical Society.*Corresponding author: alexey.silakov@gmail.com.

A robust understanding of this control is a major unmet challenge and will be required for these systems to be exploited for potential biotechnological applications, including production of new drug compounds.The Fe/2OG aliphatic halogenases provide an ideal system to study enzymatic discrimination between accessible reactivities. SyrB2 from Pseudomonas syringae B301D is the founding member of the Fe/2OG aliphatic halogenases.28\u201331 It catalyzes chlorination of the C4 position of L-threonine appended via a thioester linkage to the phosphopantetheine arm of the companion aminoacyl carrier protein, SyrB1 (hereafter, all L-aminoacyl-S-SyrB1 substrates are abbreviated by designating only the appended amino acid in boldface type, e.g., Thr; Figure 1). In SyrB2, the sequence position that normally provides the carboxylate of the canonical facial triad of protein ligands is occupied by an alanine (Ala118), and the co-substrate, chloride (Cl-), occupies the vacated site in the iron coordination sphere.32 Fe/2OG halogenases mechanistically parallel the hydroxylases in that both employ ferryl intermediates as the H\u2022-abstracting species.33\u201335 However, following this step, the reactivities diverge: in the halogenases it is the Cl\u2022 ligand, rather than the HO\u2022, that couples with the substrate radical. Thus, halogenases generate the substrate radical in a manner similar to the hydroxylases, but are faced with the more difficult challenge of directing it to chlorination rather than hydroxylation. Efficient H\u2022 transfer to the ferryl would seemingly imply proximity to the hydroxo ligand in the subsequent step, and HO\u2022/substrate radical coupling occurs readily in the hydroxylases. Yet, the native substrate of SyrB2, Thr, is almost exclusively chlorinated (Figure 1),36 although non-native substrates undergo hydroxylation as well as chlorination. Therefore, SyrB2 represents an intriguing case in which two different reaction outcomes catalyzed by this enzyme family (hydroxylation and halogenation) are observed, making it an ideal system for investigating how the enzymes discriminate between reactivities.Our previous work showed that the cis-chloroferryl complex in SyrB2 reacts more rapidly with SyrB1 presenting L-aminobutyric acid (Aba) or L-norvaline (Nva) than with Thr, suggesting a programmed inefficiency in H\u2022 abstraction from the native substrate. Formed with Nva, the complex decays 130-fold more rapidly (9.5 s-1 at 5 \u00b0C) than with Thr (0.07 s-1); with Aba, the rate is intermediate (0.9 s-1) (Figure 1).36 Selectivity for chlorination is also strongly modulated: Thr is almost exclusively chlorinated, Aba is chlorinated and hydroxylated at C4 to similar extents, and Nva is predominately hydroxylated at the C5 position.36 It was reasoned that the decrease in ferryl decay rates could most simply arise from an increase in the distance between the H\u2022 donor and acceptor. Positioning the substrate away from the ferryl oxygen would also likely diminish the efficiency of HO\u2022 rebound and could thereby enable the competing Cl\u2022 transfer in the subsequent step. These Martinie et al.Page 2J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 June 04.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript observations led to the hypothesis that substrate positioning controls outcome in SyrB2, with the native Thr being held farther away from the ferryl oxygen and closer to the halogen to trade proficiency in H\u2022 abstraction for selectivity in ligand-radical transfer.36 This hypothesis was supported by the nearly complete reversal of the outcome for Nva from hydroxylation of C5 to chlorination of C4 by deuterium (D) substitution at C5. With neither or both positions deuterium-labeled, the chloroferryl complex abstracts H(D) more rapidly from C5, but, with only C5 labeled, the C4 position is targeted more rapidly, due to the large kinetic isotope effect disfavoring D\u2022 abstraction. Redirection to C4 results in more chlorination than hydroxylation (~ 4:1), as rationalized by the positioning hypothesis.36To date, no experimental structural data to evaluate the substrate-positioning hypothesis have been reported. The nature and magnitude of repositioning that might be required to explain the observed effects on reactivity are thus unknown. Moreover, recent theoretical work has suggested that interchange of the oxygen and chloride ligands relative to their positions in the crystal structure could also contribute to the control of outcome.37,38 According to these studies, the substrate dictates both the chloro/oxo disposition and the frontier orbitals involved in the H\u2022-abstraction step, with the engagement of \u03c0-or \u03c3-type ferryl orbitals favoring Cl\u2022 or HO\u2022 transfer, respectively.38 Although not incompatible with the positioning hypothesis, this idea would imply that the differential reactivity observed for the different substrates might arise primarily from substrate-protein interactions that impact the partition between the axial and equatorial coordination isomers of the ferryl complex rather than from substrate positioning per se.Given the possibility that these other factors might be involved in directing the halogenation outcome and the likelihood that proper substrate positioning is also essential to avoidance of hydroxylation in the other types of Fe/2OG-oxygenase reactivity, we sought to directly probe the positions of the various target C-H bonds relative to the iron center. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can resolve relatively weak interactions between unpaired electrons (e.g., centered on a metallocofactor) and nearby magnetic nuclei (e.g. 1,2H, 14N). Unfortunately, all of the species in the catalytic cycle of SyrB2 that have been characterized to date have integer spin states [several high-spin (S = 2) Fe(II) forms and the high-spin (S = 2) haloferryl complex], and therefore cannot be addressed by conventional, perpendicular-mode EPR methods. Therefore, in order to obtain an EPR-active probe in the active site, an Fe-NO complex was generated (Figure 2A).39\u201341 Nitric oxide (NO\u2022) has been employed as an analog of O2 that binds to Fe(II) complexes to form an S = 3/2 iron-nitrosyl complex (denoted {Fe-NO}7)42 best described as a high-spin Fe(III) center (S = 5/2) antiferromagnetically coupled to NO-(S = 1).43\u201345 This complex is thought to be analogous to the putative {Fe-OO}8 intermediate in the catalytic cycle,43,46 and previous studies on taurine:2OG dioxygenase (TauD) have employed such complexes in combination with pulse EPR methods to determine the position of substrate C-H bonds.40,41 In this work, we employed hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopy to obtain geometric information about the active site of SyrB2 by measuring hyperfine couplings to specifically 2H-labeled Thr, Aba, and Nva substrates. The magnitude and orientation dependence of these hyperfine parameters provide spatial information about the labeled position relative to the metallocofactor; these data represent the first experimental Martinie et al.Page 3J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 June 04.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript structural data on the SyrB2:aminoacyl-SyrB1 complex and reveal the nature and extent of repositioning in the SyrB2 substrates exhibiting such widely divergent reactivities.Results When the complex of SyrB2 with its substrates is exposed to gaseous NO, a dark yellow complex characterized by an almost axial EPR signal (Figure 2B) with principal geff values of 4.06, 3.99, and 2.00 is produced. These parameters are typical of {Fe-NO}7 complexes with S = 3/2 ground states and minor rhombicity in the zero-field splitting.40,41,43 Figure 3A shows a Q-band HYSCORE spectrum collected for the {Fe-NO}7 form of SyrB2 in complex with SyrB1 presenting 4,4,5,5,5-[2H5]-L-norvaline (hereafter abbreviated NO-4,5-d5-Nva). In 2H-HYSCORE spectra, hyperfine coupling is manifest as splitting along the anti-diagonal, centered on the deuterium Larmor frequency; in addition, further splitting along the diagonal is observed due to the nuclear quadrupole interaction (Figure 2D). At geff = 3.98 (~613 mT), the observed HYSCORE spectrum exhibits such a signal, centered at the deuterium Larmor frequency (4.0 MHz; Figure 3A). Comparison with the same spectrum collected for a sample prepared with all-protium norvaline (NO-Nva) reveals that this feature is attributable to deuterium (Figure 3D). Additional features are observed in all measured spectra (Figure S1), and are attributed to matrix protons and 14N nuclei (e.g. from the histidine ligands and/or from NO), consistent with previous observations on similar systems.40 For the NO-4,5-d5-Nva complex, it is ambiguous whether the 2H-HYSCORE signals arise from interactions with deuterium nuclei at C4, C5, or both positions. However, the spectrum of the complex prepared with 5,5,5-[2H3]-Nva (NO-5-d3-Nva) at geff = 3.98 (Figure 3B) reveals features that are essentially identical to those of NO-4,5-d5-Nva. Moreover, spectra of the NO-4-d2-Nva complex have features with visibly reduced width and intensity compared to either NO-4,5-d5-Nva or NO-5-d3-Nva (Figure 3C). Therefore, the signals observed for NO-4,5-d5-Nva are attributed to deuterons at the C5 position.Because the deuterium nuclei of interest lie along a particular vector in the active site, the hyperfine interaction will have an angular dependence with respect to the electronic g-tensor (Figure 2C and 2D). In order to ascertain this angular dependence, HYSCORE spectra for NO-4,5-d5-Nva were collected at multiple magnetic fields (Figure S2), corresponding to excitation of different orientational sub-populations of spins (Figure 2C). For all spectra collected, signals for NO-4,5-d5-Nva and NO-5-d3-Nva were essentially identical (Figure S3), and were simulated by a single axial hyperfine coupling with magnitude T = 0.40 \u00b1 0.05 MHz and quadrupole coupling constant K = 0.035 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Table S1, Figures S2 and S3). The ability of a single deuterium hyperfine coupling (rather than three) to adequately account for the observed spectra likely reflects rotational averaging of the three C5 deuterons. In similar fashion, field-dependent spectra of NO-4-d2-Nva were simulated with parameters T = 0.28 \u00b1 0.05 MHz and K = 0.025 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Table S1, Figure S4).Field-dependent HYSCORE spectra of the NO complex formed with the substrate 2,3,3,4,4,4-[2H6]-Aba (NO-per-d6-Aba) reveal deuterium features that are visibly less broad than those arising from NO-4,5-d5-Nva, suggesting that, in this sample, the hyperfine interactions are weaker and the deuterium nuclei more distant from the {Fe-NO}7 moiety (Figures 4A and S5). As in the case of Nva, the spectral features of the NO-per-d6-Aba Martinie et al.Page 4J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 June 04.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript complex arise primarily from the methyl deuterons. This fact, established by the weaker and narrower signals from the NO-3-d2-Aba complex (Figure 4B), shows that the deuterium nuclei at C4 are the closest to the {Fe-NO}7 unit, consistent with the known ability of C4 but not C3 to donate H\u2022 to the ferryl intermediate.35 Although, in principle, the spectrum of NO-per-d6-Aba may also contain some contribution from the single deuteron at C2, the complete inactivity of C2 for H\u2022 donation to the ferryl in multiple different non-native substrates suggests that this contribution should be negligible. The spectra for NO-per-d6-Aba were simulated with axial hyperfine and quadrupole coupling tensors with magnitude T = 0.29 \u00b1 0.04 MHz and K = 0.050 \u00b1 0.005 MHz, respectively (Table S1, Figure S5). Spectra collected for NO-3-d2-Aba were simulated with T = 0.14 \u00b1 0.02 MHz and K = 0.043 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Table S1, Figure S6).The native substrate of SyrB2, Thr, is almost exclusively chlorinated, and determination of the position of this substrate relative to the cofactor is of particular interest. Therefore, field-dependent HYSCORE spectra of the NO complex formed with the substrate 2,3,4,4,4-[2H5]-Thr (NO-per-d5-Thr) were recorded. These spectra are similar to the spectra of NO-per-d6-Aba, although the 2H signals are discernibly less broad (Figure 5A). Spectra were also collected for the complex prepared with 2,3-d2-Thr (Figure 5B). As in the case of Aba and Nva, the absence of deuteria on the terminal methyl group results in diminished width and intensity of the 2H HYSCORE crosspeaks (Figure 5), thus allowing assignment of the majority of the 2H signals in the NO-per-d5-Thr spectrum to deuterons on C4. The field-dependent spectra of NO-per-d5-Thr were simulated with T = 0.20 \u00b1 0.03 MHz and K = 0.040 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Table S1, Figure S7). Signals for NO-2,3-d2-Thr, which we attribute primarily to the single deuteron at the C3 position, were simulated with T = 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 MHz and K = 0.043 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Figure S8).In previous studies on {Fe-NO}7 complexes in enzymes, the point-dipole approximation has been used to relate the magnitude of the hyperfine coupling to an Fe-2H distance, with the second hyperfine Euler angle (\u03b8) roughly corresponding to the (O)N-Fe-2H angle.39\u201341 To provide more accurate Fe-2H distance and N-Fe-2H angle estimates, we instead developed a geometric model that accounts for spin-density distribution across the Fe-NO unit, with explicit dipolar contributions from both the ferric and NO-species (see Materials and Methods). Analyzed by this model, the observed hyperfine parameters correspond to Fe-2H distances of 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5, 3.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5, 3.7 \u00b1 0.3 and 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5, and N-Fe-2H angles of 85 \u00b1 10, 85 \u00b1 10, 81 \u00b1 15, and 64 \u00b1 7 degrees for NO-per-d5-Thr, NO-per-d6-Aba, NO-4-d2-Nva, and NO-4,5-d5-Nva, respectively (Table S2, Figure 6B).Discussion Comparison of the hyperfine coupling constants for the methyl groups of the three substrates investigated reveals a striking trend (Figure 6A). The magnitude of the hyperfine coupling increases significantly through the series: NO-per-d5-Thr (0.20 MHz), NO-per-d6-Aba (0.29 MHz), NO-4,5-d5-Nva (0.40 MHz), corresponding to distances of 4.2 \u00c5, 3.7 \u00c5, and 3.4 \u00c5, respectively. The observed deuterium positions are fully consistent with the trends in H\u2022-abstraction rate constants and chlorination selectivity previously reported for these substrates. Nva is the most efficient H\u2022 donor to the ferryl complex and is closest to the Martinie et al.Page 5J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 June 04.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript metallocofactor (3.4 \u00c5). H\u2022 transfer from Thr, 0.8 \u00c5 farther away, is markedly (130-fold) slower. The observed distances for NO-4-d2-Nva and NO-per-d6-Aba are very similar, just as the reactivities of C4 of Aba and Nva are similar. Finally, the hyperfine couplings observed for NO-3-d2-Aba and NO-2,3-d2-Thr correspond to distances of 4.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5 and 4.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00c5, respectively, consistent with published observations that the chloroferryl complex in SyrB2 does not target the C3 position (e.g., of Ala).35The N-Fe-D angle of 85\u00b0 implies that the target deuterons of Thr lie nearly in the plane perpendicular to the Fe-N bond (Figure 6B). Under the simplest assumption, the oxo group of the ferryl complex and hydroxo ligand of the Fe(III)-OH/substrate-radical state would reside in approximately the same location as the nitrosyl ligand (Figure 1). This disposition of substrate and cofactor would also help to rationalize the reactivity data. As shown by computational studies, the nearly orthogonal Fe=O/C\u2013H orientation would result in poor orbital overlap and would thus be expected to afford relatively inefficient H\u2022 abstraction, as observed for Thr. The large angle would then also place the substrate radical relatively far from the hydroxo ligand and potentially much closer to the chloro ligand, which is also expected to lie in the plane perpendicular to the Fe-N bond (Figure 6B). The predominant chlorination observed for Thr would thus be rationalized. It should be noted that the position of the Cl-ligand within the plane perpendicular to the Fe-N bond cannot be determined from these data; however, based on the observation of Cl\u2022 transfer, it is likely that the target 2H is close to the Cl-(i.e. that the Cl-Fe-N-2H dihedral angle is small). Intriguingly, the relatively modest structural perturbations observed for Nva, including a ~0.8 \u00c5 closer approach and ~20\u00b0 tilt towards the Fe-N(O) bond, are sufficient to largely unleash both the H\u2022-abstraction potency of the ferryl and the default hydroxylation outcome. Although NO-per-d5-Thr, NO-per-d6-Aba, and NO-4-d2-Nva all exhibit similar angles (80\u201385\u00b0), the C4 carbons of both Nva and Aba nevertheless exhibit a partial loss of selectivity, undergoing a mixture of hydroxylation and chlorination. As previously suggested, this difference is potentially attributable to the shorter average distance of the C4 carbon in the non-native substrates from the cofactor (shown here to be the ~0.5 \u00c5), to greater flexibility of the non-native side-chains for dynamic approach, or to both. As the only structural distinction between Thr and Aba, the \u03b2-hydroxyl group of Thr seemingly must serve to anchor the native side chain (e.g., via hydrogen bonding) either to enforce the greater distance or to restrict its dynamics (or both). Elucidation of this interaction could provide avenues for rational design to promote halogenation of alternative substrates.Overall, the striking correlation between the observed distances and angles and the reactivity patterns of Thr, Aba, and Nva strongly corroborates the assertion that substrate positioning controls chemoselectivity in SyrB2. These data do not rule out the possibility that coordination isomerism also contributes to selectivity, but the magnitude of the differences in positioning observed in this study strongly suggests that substrate positioning exerts a major influence. In addition, our measurements define this differential positioning; the native substrate is held close to the chloride in the plane perpendicular to the Fe-N(O) bond, but at a greater distance from the iron center compared to the non-native substrates. The result of this careful positioning of the native substrate is relatively sluggish H\u2022 abstraction by the ferryl intermediate but high chlorination selectivity in the ligand-transfer step.Martinie et al.Page 6J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 June 04.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript Although these experiments define the position of the substrate, the interactions which dictate this positioning remain unknown. The large angle observed for NO-per-d5-Thr is not obviously consistent with previous docking models together with the simplest assumption that NO would replace the water ligand in the published x-ray crystal structure32 (Figure S9A).37 However, NO coordination at one of the two sites occupied in the crystal structure by the chloride ion and by C1 of 2OG could result in the observed angle (Figure S9B and S9C). The latter of these two NO binding modes has been observed in clavaminate synthase.47 Our results thus imply that, for the docking model to be correct, a shift of the Cl-ligand or the 2OG carboxylate must accompany addition of NO, and, by analogy, possibly also O2, to the Fe(II) cofactor. Alternatively, it is also possible that SyrB1 may bind in a different manner that places the substrate at the observed angle when NO adds at the position of the water. This question emphasizes the importance of further structural characterization of the SyrB1:SyrB2 complex.Finally, the measurement of substrate placement for carbon centers undergoing different outcomes maps the transition from hydroxylation to halogenation; these parameters potentially provide a geometric map for the promotion or suppression of hydroxylation in the Fe/2OG reaction manifold. The striking conclusion is that relatively stringent control of substrate position is required to suppress the hydroxylation outcome. We suggest that these parameters establish guiding metrics for analyzing other alternative reactions catalyzed by members of the Fe/2OG family. By comparison of substrate positions in other enzymes with the parameters reported here, cases (e.g., olefin-installing 1,2-dehydrogenations in biosyntheses of antibiotics) in which hydroxylation might or might not be part of the mechanistic pathway can now be analyzed to ascertain whether these poorly understood alternative outcomes arise from avoiding HO\u2022 rebound (as in the SyrB2 reaction) or from further processing of a hydroxylated intermediate in a \u201ccryptic hydroxylation\u201d mechanism.Conclusion Hyperfine couplings have been measured between a series of deuterium labeled substrates and an active-site {Fe-NO}7 complex of the Fe/2OG aliphatic halogenase, SyrB2. Analysis of these parameters provides the first experimental structural data on the complex of an Fe/2OG halogenase with its substrate. The methyl groups of the substrates Thr, Aba, and Nva lie 4.2 \u00c5, 3.7 \u00c5, and 3.4 \u00c5 from the metallocofactor (Fe-D distance), explaining the previously observed trend in rates of H\u2022 abstraction and chlorination-versus-hydroxylation selectivity. In addition, the distances observed for adjacent positions (C3 of Thr and Aba and C4 of Nva) are also consistent with expectations from reactivity studies. The results, along with the analogy of the iron-nitrosyl complex to oxygen-bound intermediates in the catalytic cycle, substantiate the hypothesis that substrate positioning controls reaction outcome in SyrB2 catalysis. Both a relatively long Fe-D distance and almost perpendicular N-Fe-D angle conspire to promote chlorination of the native substrate, Thr. Moreover, the structural parameters for targets spanning the continuum of SyrB2 reactivity, from almost pure halogenation to predominant hydroxylation, lay a foundation for the investigation of how other Fe/2OG enzymes are able to direct other reactions in the diverse array catalyzed by this important enzyme family.Martinie et al.Page 7J Am Chem Soc.

After deoxygenation, SyrB2, Fe(II), Cl-, 2OG, and aminoacyl-S-SyrB1 were mixed in a MBraun (Stratham, NH) anoxic chamber to final concentrations of 1.25 mM, 1.15 mM, 10 mM, 5 mM, and 1.6 mM, respectively. The resulting solution was returned to the Schlenk line; the flask was briefly evacuated to ~100 Torr and slowly refilled with nitric oxide gas (Messer) to > 900 Torr. Under this atmosphere, the protein was incubated on ice with brisk stirring for 10 min, as the dark yellow color developed. The resulting complex was concentrated anaerobically by spin filtration to approximately half its original volume (~15 min), transferred to an EPR tube, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.Electron Paramagnetic Resonance MeasurementsContinuous wave (CW) and pulse EPR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Elexsys E580 spectrometer equipped with a SuperX-FT microwave bridge. CW spectra were acquired at X-band frequencies using a Bruker SHQE resonator. A temperature of 7 K was maintained with an ER 4112-HV Oxford Instruments liquid helium flow cryostat.Field-swept pulse EPR and HYSCORE spectra were acquired at Q-band frequencies by using a home-built intermediate-frequency extension of the SuperX-FT X-band bridge that has a Millitech 5W pulse power amplifier. All experiments were conducted on a home-built TE011 resonator utilizing the open resonator concept developed by Annino et al.48 and mechanical construction of the probehead similar to that presented by Reijerse et al.49 This setup allows t(\u03c0/2) = 12\u201316 ns at maximum input power with spectrometer dead time (including the resonator ring time) of 100\u2013120 ns. Data acquisition and control of experimental parameters were performed by using Bruker XEPR software.HYSCORE SpectraHYSCORE spectra were obtained using the standard HYSCORE program available in the XEPR software, with the exception of HYSCORE spectra collected at 950 mT. For standard HYSCORE measurements, the parameters t(\u03c0/2) = 8 ns and \u03c4 = 140 ns (variables defined in Figure S10) were used. HYSCORE spectra at 950 mT were collected using the matched HYSCORE technique utilizing a PulseSpel program in XEPR.50 In the latter case, the length of the second and fourth \u03c0/2 pulses was adjusted to match the 2H Larmor frequency of 6.2 MHz, tm \u2245 40 ns (Figure S10). For this purpose the pulses were generated by the secondary pulse forming unit (i.e, using the \u00b1<x> channels) and attenuated to allow for t(\u03c0/2) = 40 ns. Martinie et al.Page 8J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 June 04.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript Unless otherwise noted, spectra were collected with a 28 ns step size and with 300 points (602, 613, and 700 mT) or 200 points (950 mT) in the x and y dimensions. Shot repetition time was set to 50 \u03bcs, with 100 shots per point. Typical number of scans averaged was: 6 (602 mT), 3 (613 mT), 12 (700 mT), and 45 (950 mT). A standard four-step phase cycle was used in all cases. Additional experimental parameters are reported in the figure legends.Data AnalysisData processing and spectral simulations were performed using Kazan viewer, a homewritten suite of utilities in MATLAB.51 One-dimensional EPR simulations were performed using the \u201cpepper\u201d utility from the EasySpin software package.52 HYSCORE data were analyzed by simultaneous frequency domain simulation of all field-dependent spectra until a satisfactory solution was achieved. To reduce the number of fitting variables, a purely axial point-dipolar model of the 2H hyperfine interaction was used:(1) where T is the magnitude of the interaction. In addition, the quadrupole coupling was assumed to be purely axial; thus, the following principal values of the quadrupole coupling were used:(2) where K = eqQ/[4I(2I+1)h], eqQ is the strength of the electric field gradient, and I is the nuclear spin quantum number (I = 1 for 2H). In the case of NO-per-d6-Aba and NO-4-d2-Nva, the axial quadrupole interaction was found to be insufficient, and an additional fitting variable \u03b7 was introduced such that(3) Details of the parameters used to simulate the experimental data are provided in Table S1. The orientation of a given tensor is defined by the Euler angles (y convention) \u03d5, \u03b8, and \u03c8. In axial tensors, the \u03d5 angle is meaningless and was not included in any simulations. Uncertainty analysis was performed by stepwise alteration of a given parameter until the fit quality was unacceptable by visual inspection. Both fits and uncertainty analysis were confirmed by construction of one-dimensional \u201cskyline\u201d plots. These plots were constructed with the skyline along the anti-diagonal of the HYSCORE plot, in order to remove width contributions arising from quadrupolar interactions (Figure S11).Distance and angle information was obtained by constructing a model which accounts for hyperfine coupling of the deuterium nucleus with the S = 1 NO-species and the S = 5/2 ferric species. Distances and angles fixed on the basis of studies on model complexes were: Fe-N = 1.75 \u00c5, N-O = 1.14 \u00c5.53 Varying the Fe-N-O angle from 120\u2013180\u00b0 and the O-N-Fe-2H dihedral from 0\u2013180\u00b0 produced small deviations relative to the uncertainty in simulation of the hyperfine parameters. The reported parameters are for Fe-N-O = 150\u00b0 and O-N-Fe-2H = 180\u00b0 (Figure S12). The z-component of the ground state g-tensor was assumed to lie along the Fe-N bond.43 For a given deuterium position, dipolar coupling tensors AFeD, Martinie et al.Page 9J Am Chem Soc.

(1) to calculate the principal components of the tensors with magnitude, TXD, according to the formula:(4) Then, the individual tensors were oriented along the corresponding X-D vectors and combined, accounting for the appropriate spin-projection factors and assuming equal spin density on nitrogen and oxygen:(5) where 7/5 and -2/5 are the spin-projection factors for iron and NO, respectively.54 In addition, the Atot tensor was rotated according to the third Euler angle (\u03c8) in the orientation of the experimentally derived hyperfine tensors. The Fe-2H distance and N-Fe-2H angle were then varied to match the experimentally observed hyperfine tensor (see Tables S1 & S2).

        "USAAbstract The iron(II)-and 2-(oxo)glutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) oxygenases catalyze an array of challenging transformations, but how individual members of the enzyme family direct different outcomes is poorly understood. The Fe/2OG halogenase, SyrB2, chlorinates C4 of its native substrate, L-threonine appended to the carrier protein, SyrB1, but hydroxylates C5 of L-norvaline and, to a lesser extent, C4 of L-aminobutyric acid when SyrB1 presents these non-native amino acids. To test the hypothesis that positioning of the targeted carbon dictates the outcome, we defined the positions of these three substrates by measuring hyperfine couplings between substrate deuterium atoms and the stable, EPR-active iron-nitrosyl adduct, a surrogate for reaction intermediates. The Fe-2H distances and N-Fe-2H angles, which vary from 4.2 \u00c5 and 85\u00b0 for threonine to 3.4 \u00c5 and 65\u00b0 for norvaline, rationalize the trends in reactivity. This experimental correlation of position to outcome should aid in judging from structural data on other Fe/2OG enzymes whether they suppress hydroxylation or form hydroxylated intermediates on the pathways to other",

A robust understanding of this control is a major unmet challenge and will be required for these systems to be exploited for potential biotechnological applications, including production of new drug",
        "compounds.The Fe/2OG aliphatic halogenases provide an ideal system to study enzymatic discrimination between accessible reactivities. SyrB2 from Pseudomonas syringae B301D is the founding member of the Fe/2OG aliphatic halogenases.28\u201331 It catalyzes chlorination of the C4 position of L-threonine appended via a thioester linkage to the phosphopantetheine arm of the companion aminoacyl carrier protein, SyrB1 (hereafter, all L-aminoacyl-S-SyrB1 substrates are abbreviated by designating only the appended amino acid in boldface type, e.g., Thr; Figure 1). In SyrB2, the sequence position that normally provides the carboxylate of the canonical facial triad of protein ligands is occupied by an alanine (Ala118), and the co-substrate, chloride (Cl-), occupies the vacated site in the iron coordination sphere.32 Fe/2OG halogenases mechanistically parallel the hydroxylases in that both employ ferryl intermediates as the H\u2022-abstracting species.33\u201335 However, following this step, the reactivities diverge: in the halogenases it is the Cl\u2022 ligand, rather than the HO\u2022, that couples with the substrate radical. Thus, halogenases generate the substrate radical in a manner similar to the hydroxylases, but are faced with the more difficult challenge of directing it to chlorination rather than hydroxylation. Efficient H\u2022 transfer to the ferryl would seemingly imply proximity to the hydroxo ligand in the subsequent step, and HO\u2022/substrate radical coupling occurs readily in the hydroxylases. Yet, the native substrate of SyrB2, Thr, is almost exclusively chlorinated (Figure 1),36 although non-native substrates undergo hydroxylation as well as chlorination. Therefore, SyrB2 represents an intriguing case in which two different reaction outcomes catalyzed by this enzyme family (hydroxylation and halogenation) are observed, making it an ideal system for investigating how the enzymes discriminate between",
        "reactivities.Our previous work showed that the cis-chloroferryl complex in SyrB2 reacts more rapidly with SyrB1 presenting L-aminobutyric acid (Aba) or L-norvaline (Nva) than with Thr, suggesting a programmed inefficiency in H\u2022 abstraction from the native substrate. Formed with Nva, the complex decays 130-fold more rapidly (9.5 s-1 at 5 \u00b0C) than with Thr (0.07 s-1); with Aba, the rate is intermediate (0.9 s-1) (Figure 1).36 Selectivity for chlorination is also strongly modulated: Thr is almost exclusively chlorinated, Aba is chlorinated and hydroxylated at C4 to similar extents, and Nva is predominately hydroxylated at the C5 position.36 It was reasoned that the decrease in ferryl decay rates could most simply arise from an increase in the distance between the H\u2022 donor and acceptor. Positioning the substrate away from the ferryl oxygen would also likely diminish the efficiency of HO\u2022 rebound and could thereby enable the competing Cl\u2022 transfer in the subsequent step.

        "observations led to the hypothesis that substrate positioning controls outcome in SyrB2, with the native Thr being held farther away from the ferryl oxygen and closer to the halogen to trade proficiency in H\u2022 abstraction for selectivity in ligand-radical transfer.36 This hypothesis was supported by the nearly complete reversal of the outcome for Nva from hydroxylation of C5 to chlorination of C4 by deuterium (D) substitution at C5. With neither or both positions deuterium-labeled, the chloroferryl complex abstracts H(D) more rapidly from C5, but, with only C5 labeled, the C4 position is targeted more rapidly, due to the large kinetic isotope effect disfavoring D\u2022 abstraction. Redirection to C4 results in more chlorination than hydroxylation (~ 4:1), as rationalized by the positioning",
        "hypothesis.36To date, no experimental structural data to evaluate the substrate-positioning hypothesis have been reported. The nature and magnitude of repositioning that might be required to explain the observed effects on reactivity are thus unknown. Moreover, recent theoretical work has suggested that interchange of the oxygen and chloride ligands relative to their positions in the crystal structure could also contribute to the control of outcome.37,38 According to these studies, the substrate dictates both the chloro/oxo disposition and the frontier orbitals involved in the H\u2022-abstraction step, with the engagement of \u03c0-or \u03c3-type ferryl orbitals favoring Cl\u2022 or HO\u2022 transfer, respectively.38 Although not incompatible with the positioning hypothesis, this idea would imply that the differential reactivity observed for the different substrates might arise primarily from substrate-protein interactions that impact the partition between the axial and equatorial coordination isomers of the ferryl complex rather than from substrate positioning per",
        "se.Given the possibility that these other factors might be involved in directing the halogenation outcome and the likelihood that proper substrate positioning is also essential to avoidance of hydroxylation in the other types of Fe/2OG-oxygenase reactivity, we sought to directly probe the positions of the various target C-H bonds relative to the iron center. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can resolve relatively weak interactions between unpaired electrons (e.g., centered on a metallocofactor) and nearby magnetic nuclei (e.g. 1,2H, 14N). Unfortunately, all of the species in the catalytic cycle of SyrB2 that have been characterized to date have integer spin states [several high-spin (S = 2) Fe(II) forms and the high-spin (S = 2) haloferryl complex], and therefore cannot be addressed by conventional, perpendicular-mode EPR methods. Therefore, in order to obtain an EPR-active probe in the active site, an Fe-NO complex was generated (Figure 2A).39\u201341 Nitric oxide (NO\u2022) has been employed as an analog of O2 that binds to Fe(II) complexes to form an S = 3/2 iron-nitrosyl complex (denoted {Fe-NO}7)42 best described as a high-spin Fe(III) center (S = 5/2) antiferromagnetically coupled to NO-(S = 1).43\u201345 This complex is thought to be analogous to the putative {Fe-OO}8 intermediate in the catalytic cycle,43,46 and previous studies on taurine:2OG dioxygenase (TauD) have employed such complexes in combination with pulse EPR methods to determine the position of substrate C-H bonds.40,41 In this work, we employed hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopy to obtain geometric information about the active site of SyrB2 by measuring hyperfine couplings to specifically 2H-labeled Thr, Aba, and Nva substrates. The magnitude and orientation dependence of these hyperfine parameters provide spatial information about the labeled position relative to the metallocofactor; these data represent the first experimental",

        "When the complex of SyrB2 with its substrates is exposed to gaseous NO, a dark yellow complex characterized by an almost axial EPR signal (Figure 2B) with principal geff values of 4.06, 3.99, and 2.00 is produced. These parameters are typical of {Fe-NO}7 complexes with S = 3/2 ground states and minor rhombicity in the zero-field splitting.40,41,43 Figure 3A shows a Q-band HYSCORE spectrum collected for the {Fe-NO}7 form of SyrB2 in complex with SyrB1 presenting 4,4,5,5,5-[2H5]-L-norvaline (hereafter abbreviated NO-4,5-d5-Nva). In 2H-HYSCORE spectra, hyperfine coupling is manifest as splitting along the anti-diagonal, centered on the deuterium Larmor frequency; in addition, further splitting along the diagonal is observed due to the nuclear quadrupole interaction (Figure 2D). At geff = 3.98 (~613 mT), the observed HYSCORE spectrum exhibits such a signal, centered at the deuterium Larmor frequency (4.0 MHz; Figure 3A). Comparison with the same spectrum collected for a sample prepared with all-protium norvaline (NO-Nva) reveals that this feature is attributable to deuterium (Figure 3D). Additional features are observed in all measured spectra (Figure S1), and are attributed to matrix protons and 14N nuclei (e.g. from the histidine ligands and/or from NO), consistent with previous observations on similar systems.40 For the NO-4,5-d5-Nva complex, it is ambiguous whether the 2H-HYSCORE signals arise from interactions with deuterium nuclei at C4, C5, or both positions. However, the spectrum of the complex prepared with 5,5,5-[2H3]-Nva (NO-5-d3-Nva) at geff = 3.98 (Figure 3B) reveals features that are essentially identical to those of NO-4,5-d5-Nva. Moreover, spectra of the NO-4-d2-Nva complex have features with visibly reduced width and intensity compared to either NO-4,5-d5-Nva or NO-5-d3-Nva (Figure 3C). Therefore, the signals observed for NO-4,5-d5-Nva are attributed to deuterons at the C5",
        "position.Because the deuterium nuclei of interest lie along a particular vector in the active site, the hyperfine interaction will have an angular dependence with respect to the electronic g-tensor (Figure 2C and 2D). In order to ascertain this angular dependence, HYSCORE spectra for NO-4,5-d5-Nva were collected at multiple magnetic fields (Figure S2), corresponding to excitation of different orientational sub-populations of spins (Figure 2C). For all spectra collected, signals for NO-4,5-d5-Nva and NO-5-d3-Nva were essentially identical (Figure S3), and were simulated by a single axial hyperfine coupling with magnitude T = 0.40 \u00b1 0.05 MHz and quadrupole coupling constant K = 0.035 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Table S1, Figures S2 and S3). The ability of a single deuterium hyperfine coupling (rather than three) to adequately account for the observed spectra likely reflects rotational averaging of the three C5 deuterons. In similar fashion, field-dependent spectra of NO-4-d2-Nva were simulated with parameters T = 0.28 \u00b1 0.05 MHz and K = 0.025 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Table S1, Figure",

This fact, established by the weaker and narrower signals from the NO-3-d2-Aba complex (Figure 4B), shows that the deuterium nuclei at C4 are the closest to the {Fe-NO}7 unit, consistent with the known ability of C4 but not C3 to donate H\u2022 to the ferryl intermediate.35 Although, in principle, the spectrum of NO-per-d6-Aba may also contain some contribution from the single deuteron at C2, the complete inactivity of C2 for H\u2022 donation to the ferryl in multiple different non-native substrates suggests that this contribution should be negligible. The spectra for NO-per-d6-Aba were simulated with axial hyperfine and quadrupole coupling tensors with magnitude T = 0.29 \u00b1 0.04 MHz and K = 0.050 \u00b1 0.005 MHz, respectively (Table S1, Figure S5). Spectra collected for NO-3-d2-Aba were simulated with T = 0.14 \u00b1 0.02 MHz and K = 0.043 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Table S1, Figure",
        "S6).The native substrate of SyrB2, Thr, is almost exclusively chlorinated, and determination of the position of this substrate relative to the cofactor is of particular interest. Therefore, field-dependent HYSCORE spectra of the NO complex formed with the substrate 2,3,4,4,4-[2H5]-Thr (NO-per-d5-Thr) were recorded. These spectra are similar to the spectra of NO-per-d6-Aba, although the 2H signals are discernibly less broad (Figure 5A). Spectra were also collected for the complex prepared with 2,3-d2-Thr (Figure 5B). As in the case of Aba and Nva, the absence of deuteria on the terminal methyl group results in diminished width and intensity of the 2H HYSCORE crosspeaks (Figure 5), thus allowing assignment of the majority of the 2H signals in the NO-per-d5-Thr spectrum to deuterons on C4. The field-dependent spectra of NO-per-d5-Thr were simulated with T = 0.20 \u00b1 0.03 MHz and K = 0.040 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Table S1, Figure S7). Signals for NO-2,3-d2-Thr, which we attribute primarily to the single deuteron at the C3 position, were simulated with T = 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 MHz and K = 0.043 \u00b1 0.005 MHz (Figure",
        "S8).In previous studies on {Fe-NO}7 complexes in enzymes, the point-dipole approximation has been used to relate the magnitude of the hyperfine coupling to an Fe-2H distance, with the second hyperfine Euler angle (\u03b8) roughly corresponding to the (O)N-Fe-2H angle.39\u201341 To provide more accurate Fe-2H distance and N-Fe-2H angle estimates, we instead developed a geometric model that accounts for spin-density distribution across the Fe-NO unit, with explicit dipolar contributions from both the ferric and NO-species (see Materials and Methods). Analyzed by this model, the observed hyperfine parameters correspond to Fe-2H distances of 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5, 3.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5, 3.7 \u00b1 0.3 and 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5, and N-Fe-2H angles of 85 \u00b1 10, 85 \u00b1 10, 81 \u00b1 15, and 64 \u00b1 7 degrees for NO-per-d5-Thr, NO-per-d6-Aba, NO-4-d2-Nva, and NO-4,5-d5-Nva, respectively (Table S2, Figure",

        "Comparison of the hyperfine coupling constants for the methyl groups of the three substrates investigated reveals a striking trend (Figure 6A). The magnitude of the hyperfine coupling increases significantly through the series: NO-per-d5-Thr (0.20 MHz), NO-per-d6-Aba (0.29 MHz), NO-4,5-d5-Nva (0.40 MHz), corresponding to distances of 4.2 \u00c5, 3.7 \u00c5, and 3.4 \u00c5, respectively.

The observed distances for NO-4-d2-Nva and NO-per-d6-Aba are very similar, just as the reactivities of C4 of Aba and Nva are similar. Finally, the hyperfine couplings observed for NO-3-d2-Aba and NO-2,3-d2-Thr correspond to distances of 4.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5 and 4.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00c5, respectively, consistent with published observations that the chloroferryl complex in SyrB2 does not target the C3 position (e.g., of",
        "Ala).35The N-Fe-D angle of 85\u00b0 implies that the target deuterons of Thr lie nearly in the plane perpendicular to the Fe-N bond (Figure 6B). Under the simplest assumption, the oxo group of the ferryl complex and hydroxo ligand of the Fe(III)-OH/substrate-radical state would reside in approximately the same location as the nitrosyl ligand (Figure 1). This disposition of substrate and cofactor would also help to rationalize the reactivity data. As shown by computational studies, the nearly orthogonal Fe=O/C\u2013H orientation would result in poor orbital overlap and would thus be expected to afford relatively inefficient H\u2022 abstraction, as observed for Thr. The large angle would then also place the substrate radical relatively far from the hydroxo ligand and potentially much closer to the chloro ligand, which is also expected to lie in the plane perpendicular to the Fe-N bond (Figure 6B). The predominant chlorination observed for Thr would thus be rationalized. It should be noted that the position of the Cl-ligand within the plane perpendicular to the Fe-N bond cannot be determined from these data; however, based on the observation of Cl\u2022 transfer, it is likely that the target 2H is close to the Cl-(i.e. that the Cl-Fe-N-2H dihedral angle is small). Intriguingly, the relatively modest structural perturbations observed for Nva, including a ~0.8 \u00c5 closer approach and ~20\u00b0 tilt towards the Fe-N(O) bond, are sufficient to largely unleash both the H\u2022-abstraction potency of the ferryl and the default hydroxylation outcome. Although NO-per-d5-Thr, NO-per-d6-Aba, and NO-4-d2-Nva all exhibit similar angles (80\u201385\u00b0), the C4 carbons of both Nva and Aba nevertheless exhibit a partial loss of selectivity, undergoing a mixture of hydroxylation and chlorination. As previously suggested, this difference is potentially attributable to the shorter average distance of the C4 carbon in the non-native substrates from the cofactor (shown here to be the ~0.5 \u00c5), to greater flexibility of the non-native side-chains for dynamic approach, or to both. As the only structural distinction between Thr and Aba, the \u03b2-hydroxyl group of Thr seemingly must serve to anchor the native side chain (e.g., via hydrogen bonding) either to enforce the greater distance or to restrict its dynamics (or both). Elucidation of this interaction could provide avenues for rational design to promote halogenation of alternative",
        "substrates.Overall, the striking correlation between the observed distances and angles and the reactivity patterns of Thr, Aba, and Nva strongly corroborates the assertion that substrate positioning controls chemoselectivity in SyrB2. These data do not rule out the possibility that coordination isomerism also contributes to selectivity, but the magnitude of the differences in positioning observed in this study strongly suggests that substrate positioning exerts a major influence. In addition, our measurements define this differential positioning; the native substrate is held close to the chloride in the plane perpendicular to the Fe-N(O) bond, but at a greater distance from the iron center compared to the non-native substrates. The result of this careful positioning of the native substrate is relatively sluggish H\u2022 abstraction by the ferryl intermediate but high chlorination selectivity in the ligand-transfer",

        "Although these experiments define the position of the substrate, the interactions which dictate this positioning remain unknown. The large angle observed for NO-per-d5-Thr is not obviously consistent with previous docking models together with the simplest assumption that NO would replace the water ligand in the published x-ray crystal structure32 (Figure S9A).37 However, NO coordination at one of the two sites occupied in the crystal structure by the chloride ion and by C1 of 2OG could result in the observed angle (Figure S9B and S9C). The latter of these two NO binding modes has been observed in clavaminate synthase.47 Our results thus imply that, for the docking model to be correct, a shift of the Cl-ligand or the 2OG carboxylate must accompany addition of NO, and, by analogy, possibly also O2, to the Fe(II) cofactor. Alternatively, it is also possible that SyrB1 may bind in a different manner that places the substrate at the observed angle when NO adds at the position of the water. This question emphasizes the importance of further structural characterization of the SyrB1:SyrB2",
        "complex.Finally, the measurement of substrate placement for carbon centers undergoing different outcomes maps the transition from hydroxylation to halogenation; these parameters potentially provide a geometric map for the promotion or suppression of hydroxylation in the Fe/2OG reaction manifold. The striking conclusion is that relatively stringent control of substrate position is required to suppress the hydroxylation outcome. We suggest that these parameters establish guiding metrics for analyzing other alternative reactions catalyzed by members of the Fe/2OG family. By comparison of substrate positions in other enzymes with the parameters reported here, cases (e.g., olefin-installing 1,2-dehydrogenations in biosyntheses of antibiotics) in which hydroxylation might or might not be part of the mechanistic pathway can now be analyzed to ascertain whether these poorly understood alternative outcomes arise from avoiding HO\u2022 rebound (as in the SyrB2 reaction) or from further processing of a hydroxylated intermediate in a \u201ccryptic hydroxylation\u201d",
        "mechanism.Conclusion",
        "Hyperfine couplings have been measured between a series of deuterium labeled substrates and an active-site {Fe-NO}7 complex of the Fe/2OG aliphatic halogenase, SyrB2. Analysis of these parameters provides the first experimental structural data on the complex of an Fe/2OG halogenase with its substrate. The methyl groups of the substrates Thr, Aba, and Nva lie 4.2 \u00c5, 3.7 \u00c5, and 3.4 \u00c5 from the metallocofactor (Fe-D distance), explaining the previously observed trend in rates of H\u2022 abstraction and chlorination-versus-hydroxylation selectivity. In addition, the distances observed for adjacent positions (C3 of Thr and Aba and C4 of Nva) are also consistent with expectations from reactivity studies. The results, along with the analogy of the iron-nitrosyl complex to oxygen-bound intermediates in the catalytic cycle, substantiate the hypothesis that substrate positioning controls reaction outcome in SyrB2 catalysis. Both a relatively long Fe-D distance and almost perpendicular N-Fe-D angle conspire to promote chlorination of the native substrate, Thr. Moreover, the structural parameters for targets spanning the continuum of SyrB2 reactivity, from almost pure halogenation to predominant hydroxylation, lay a foundation for the investigation of how other Fe/2OG enzymes are able to direct other reactions in the diverse array catalyzed by this important enzyme",
