Dodero,[a] and Norbert Sewald*[a] Abstract: Indigoids represent natural product-based com-pounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photo-responsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. A biocatalytic ap-proach applying several consecutive selective C@H func-tionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l-tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5-, 6-and 7-bromoindoles. Subse-quent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase fur-nishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four-step one-pot cascade gives dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. Moreover, the halogen substituent allows for late-stage diversification by cross-coupling directly per-formed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of a small set of 6,6\u2019-diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzy-matic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties. Indole is a widespread heterocycle found in many natural products.[1] For instance, indigo dyes derived from indole have been applied in textile dyeing for thousands of years due to their outstanding spectral properties.[2, 3] Indigo (1) developed to a bulk chemical in the last century whereas its C6-brominat-ed analogue, 6,6\u2019-dibromoindigo (6,6\u2019-2), the major component of the high-value pigment Tyrian purple, still remains a rarity (Scheme 1 A). Thanks to tremendous efforts by several research groups traditional indigoids recently turned into focus as natu-ral product-based, non-toxic materials for sustainable organic electronics.[4\u20136] Topical studies examining the photoswitching abilities of N,N\u2019-aryl-substituted indigos pointed to a useful strategy to tailor their photochemical properties.[7\u20139] Synthetic routes towards 1 were developed by Baeyer and by Heumann and paved the way to multi-ton production, yet its dibrominat-ed counterpart 2 has never entered an industrial scale produc-tion.[10] Today biocatalysis offers a versatile methodology to address selectivity issues, e.g. , arising from similarly reactive C@H moi-eties.[11] Recent advancements on enzyme discovery, engineer-ing as well as tremendous efforts on process development open up elaborate transformations that can be carried out under mild conditions, often with excellent selectivities.[12\u201314] Immense progress has been achieved in enzyme-catalyzed C@ H functionalization.[15] Especially oxyfunctionalization is a para-mount approach to activate C@H bonds by using biocatalysts that are capable of utilizing molecular oxygen. Manifold biocatalytic approaches in this rapidly evolving field, especially on the use of P450 enzymes, were extensively reviewed, giving a wide overview on the current state of the art.[16\u201319] The first fermentative synthesis of indigo was reported by Ensley and later by Lee et al. using a dioxygenase for indole hydroxylation. Tryptophanase that originated from endogenous tryptophan catabolism was exploited to obtain indole.[20, 21] Heme-depen-dent monooxygenases (MOs) were later evolved towards C3-hydroxylation of indole.[22\u201324] Flitsch et al. used formation of indigo-derived pigments for detecting activity of MO mu-tants.[25, 26] Biocatalytic functionalization of unprotected indole was achieved using engineered myoglobin variants which cata-lyze non-native carbene transfer in whole cells.[27] Besides using heme-dependent enzymes, also flavin-dependent MOs play a key role in oxyfunctionalization. Accordingly a flavin monooxygenase from Methylophaga sp. (mFMO) was estab-lished for the biotechnological production of indigo and indi-rubin.[28, 29] Nevertheless, the synthesis of valuable halogenated indigos has remained on analytical or small preparative scale, particularly due to the low efficiency of halogenases as a severe bottleneck. In more recent studies, Tischler and co-au-thors reported on the conversion of haloindoles using a small array of styrene MOs.[30] One-pot synthesis of indigoids either in bacteria or plant as the hosts was recently achieved: By in-troducing a tryptophan halogenase into the host strain along with a hydroxylase, production of indigoids from tryptophan was feasible, omitting the need for costly substituted indole substrates through exploiting the cellular metabolism.[31, 32] However, product titers remained low and the isolation of the pigment from the cultivation broth can become a tedious pro-cedure. Moreover, structural modifications that can be, for ex-[a] Dr. C. Schnepel, Dr. V. I. Dodero, Prof. Dr. N.

As an alternative, in vitro enzyme cascades offer a more modular approach for scaffold diversifi-cation. We embarked on the development of a modular biocatalytic platform to afford the synthesis of haloindigo that can be easily isolated and/or diversified by addressing the halogen substituents using Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling. Assembly of the indigoid scaffold is achieved by stepwise C@H functionali-zation utilizing selective halogenation and hydroxylation start-ing from l-tryptophan (3, Scheme 1 B).[15] Various recent achievements underscore that flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases are capable of regioselective aryl halogenation using O2, FADH2 and a halide salt. [33, 34] Current efforts on random and targeted engineering, immobilization and combi-nation with chemocatalysis considerably extended the synthet-ic utility of these enzymes.[35\u201340] Recent reports also showcase applications of halogenases for the synthesis of valuable chem-icals using cascades in vivo and in vitro.[41@43] However, reports on enzymatic halogenation of free indole indicate that the substitution usually occurs in the electronically most favored C3 position.[44] To retain regioselectivity at the benzene ring, it is necessary to halogenate l-tryptophan (3) instead, since the toolkit of regiocomplementary halogenases allows to specifi-cally address the C5-, C6-, or C7-position of the indole moiety (Scheme 2). Formation of crosslinked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) ena-bles preparative-scale bromination of 3 resulting in product titers of 280 mg L@1. As demonstrated in earlier studies, CLEAs permit facile upscaling of the halogenation reaction. The bro-minated amino acid is selectively obtained whereas protein contaminants are simply filtered, therefore providing a good starting point for cascade reactions.[38] In the next step, trypto-phanase catalyzes the cleavage of the amino acid backbone to release bromoindole (5): In a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent reaction, a 1,4-elimination takes place leading to 5 and pyru-vate. The gene encoding the tryptophanase TnaA (EC 4.1.99.1) from E. coli was subcloned, and the resulting enzyme was uti-lized in biotransformations (Figure S1, S2).[45, 46] Initially, the ac-tivity of TnaA towards l-6-bromotryptophan (6-4) was con-firmed in analytical-scale reactions. Upon incubation of 6-4 with purified TnaA, 6-bromoindole (6-5) was successfully formed (Scheme S3). This motivated performing TnaA-cata-lyzed elimination preceded by enzymatic halogenation in a one-pot fashion on a milligram scale (Figure 1). After quantita-tive halogenation of 3 (0.1 mmol) using the C6-halogenase Thal along with auxiliary enzymes (combiCLEAs) a cell-free ex-tract containing overexpressed TnaA was simply added to the Scheme 1. A. Structure of natural indigo dyes and diversification strategies. B. Biocatalytic retrosynthesis of haloindigo via multiple steps of C@H functionaliza-biotransformation mixture. Moreover K2HPO4 was added to a final concentration of 50 mm because potassium cations were reported to have a positive impact on TnaA,[47] whilst K+ ions were omitted during halogenation to suppress undesired activ-ity of endogenous tryptophanase. By incubation for 24 h at 25 8C, >98 % of substrate was selectively converted into 6-bro-moindole (6-5), thus avoiding intermediary isolation of 6-4 (Figure 1 B). Notable side products did not occur, which indi-cates the high selectivity of the consecutive biotransformations to isolate haloindoles in two steps that can be hardly synthe-sized otherwise. By applying TnaA crude lysate, freeze-dried cells or CLEAs, haloindoles were afforded in quantities sufficient for multistep synthesis and characterization (Table 1; Figure S4). 5-, 6-, and 7-bromo isomers of 5 hence are obtained with >90 % conver-sion on larger scale. Solely, the TnaA loading had to be in-creased in case of 7-5, presumably due to a lower activity. Final isolation of 5 merely requires desalting over a plug of re-versed-phase silica leading to a satisfying product purity of >95 % (Figure S5). Application of this cascade provides 5-, 6-and 7-bromoindole (5) in good yields ranging from 60\u201370 % for two synthetic steps, starting from 3. Inspired by these results, 6-5 was subjected to enzyme-cata-lyzed C3-hydroxylation. The flavin-dependent monooxygenase (mFMO) from Methylophaga spp. was cloned and established for biocatalysis.[28] Enzyme assays carried out with 1 mm 6-5 and ADH/iso-propanol for concomitant NADPH regeneration initially gave a purplish suspension at 25 8C. Whilst the sub-strate was fully consumed, LC-MS indicated 6-bromo-3-hydroxyindole (6) as a minor species present (Figure S6A). Not surprisingly, under aerobic conditions, the hydroxylation of 6-5 directly initiates transformation of the hydroxylated intermedi-ate into the insoluble pigment 6,6\u2019-2. Despite low solubility in DMSO and poor ionization abilities, ESI-MS analysis of the col-ored sediment suggests the presence of 6,6\u2019-dibromoindigo (6,6\u2019-2) as the biotransformation product (Figure S6B). Encouraged by these results, the hydroxylation of 5 was fur-ther optimized to obtain an efficient process for the synthesis and isolation of halogenated indigo. Seminal achievements by Fraaije et al. inspired to generate a bifunctional biocatalyst by fusion of mFMO with phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH).[48\u201352] N-terminal PTDH genetically fused to mFMO is capable of NADPH regeneration by oxidation of phosphite while the monooxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation. In case of sub-strate 6-5, the self-sufficient enzyme reached a total conversion of approx. 96 % (HPLC), whereas other regeneration systems were less productive (Table S1). Comparing the substrate con-version under optimized conditions revealed that unsubstitut-ed indole causes a 2.5-fold higher TTN than its brominated de-rivatives (Scheme S1). However, both 5-and 6-bromoindole (5-/6-5) are being reasonably converted by PTDH-mFMO with a slight preference for the C6-isomer. Only 7-5 could not be con-verted into 7,7\u2019-dibromoindigo. The optimized biotransformation steps were combined to provide a one-pot cascade allowing stepwise transformation of 3 into dibromoindigo (2). In a sequential fashion, halogenation of 3 was followed by elimination and final hydroxylation simply by adding the enzymes and cofactors required for each step without isolation of reaction intermediates (Figure 2 A). Fi-nally, the hydroxylation step reached full conversion after 96 h on 0.1 mmol scale (Figure 2 B). Initial C6-halogenation using the halogenase Thal thus furnishes a purplish-colored solid Figure 1. A. One-pot synthesis of 5-, 6-, and 7-bromoindole, respectively, by pointing to the successful formation of 6,6\u2019-2 (Figure S8). Like-wise, the halogenase PyrH (C5 halogenation) results in 5,5\u2019-2 as a blue-colored pigment. As a consequence of its insolubility in aqueous medium, pig-ment 2 precipitates quantitatively and can be simply harvested by centrifugation. However, its isolation and purification from the biotransformation extract, e.g. , from protein precipitate, proves challenging due to its low solubility. In light of a previ-ous study by Sariciftci et al. , acylation of the indigo nitrogen enhances solubility by suppression of the intramolecular hy-drogen bonds.[53] Hence, subsequent to biocatalysis the crude solid was subjected to N,N\u2019-Boc protection. As a test system to obtain a suitable procedure applicable to cascade conditions, a crude extract containing 1 was first employed (cf. Supp. Inform. for further details, Table S2). According to these opti-mized conditions, Boc2O (15 equiv) and DMAP (3 equiv) were added to a freeze-dried crude extract containing 6,6\u2019-2 re-sus-pended in DMF, which led to formation of Boc-protected di-bromoindigo (7) after stirring for 3 d at r.t. as proven by LC-MS (Figure 2 C). The soluble 6,6\u2019-7 was purified by reversed-phase silica resulting in good purity and an overall yield of 24 % after four synthetic steps referring to starting compound 3 (Fig-ure 2 A; S9). The final Boc protection step could be optimized by portion-wise addition of Boc2O/DMAP and the use of CH2Cl2 as an alternative solvent. In total, the four-step cascade starting from 0.25 mmol of 3 resulted in an increased yield of 50 % on average, based on three independent replicates. Furthermore, a biotransformation on 0.50 mmol scale gave a comparable yield (52 %). Likewise, the cascade afforded 5,5\u2019-7 in a similar yield of 46 %. Taking into account that the final product 7 is fi-nally isolated after four sequential reactions, these results indi-cate a straightforward method towards haloindigos. We further embarked on investigations to diversify 2 by Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings. Aryl substitution of indigoids is a hitherto unexplored research area. Initially cross-coupling of Boc-protected 6,6\u2019-7 to the electron-rich 3-aminophenylboronic acid was attempted in order to enhance the polarity of the target compound and to facilitate detection by ESI-MS used as a simple reaction screening. However, as the brominated start-ing material was prone to Boc cleavage as well as decomposi-tion in basic medium hindering formation of the desired aryl species, we concentrated on arylation of 2 instead. Even though the cross-coupling of the insoluble unprotect-ed dibromoindigo (2) in the crude extract proved more chal-lenging, this approach would provide convenient diversifica-tion of the natural dye and potentially enhance solubility. 6-5 (1.0 mmol) was subjected to hydroxylation and the resulting crude precipitate containing 6,6\u2019-2 was incubated with 3-ami-nophenylboronic acid, Pd(sSPhos) and K3PO4 at 130 8C in a DMF suspension. Unexpectedly, LC-MS analysis indicated formation of a mono-methylated diarylindigo whereas dimethylation was not Figure 2. A. Cascade synthesis of Boc-protected dibromoindigo using multiple biocatalysis and Boc protection. The latter step facilitates solubilization and observed (Figure S10). Pd-catalyzed aniline N-methylation has been previously described.[54] Cross-coupling at lower tempera-ture (90 8C) in iPrOH under microwave irradiation in the pres-ence of 5 equiv of arylboronic acid, 0.1 equiv Na2PdCl4, 0.25 equiv sSPhos, and 6 equiv K3PO4 gave the unmethylated target compound, accompanied only by minor side products (Figure 3 A/B). Formation of the diarylindigo 6,6\u2019-8 succeeded when using 4-hydroxyphenylboronic acid: The target diarylin-digo among other cross-coupling components and homo-coupled product were detectable in the reaction solution as well as in the precipitate (Figure 3 B). Furthermore, MS analysis of the coupling reaction of 3-aminophenylboronic acid perfect-ly correlates with the twofold coupled aniline derivative 6,6\u2019-9 whilst not resulting in the methylated side product (Figures 3 C, S11, S12). To implement indigoid arylation within the cascade, 6,6\u2019-di-bromoindigo (6,6\u2019-2) was synthesized starting from 3. The crude extract was subjected to arylation under reflux and Ar atmosphere for 4 h to form diarylindigo. In addition to 6,6\u2019-8 and 6,6\u2019-9, the phenylacetic acid-substituted derivative 6,6\u2019-10 was obtained by using the corresponding boronic acid (Scheme 3). Its carboxylate salt is also soluble in aqueous basic medium leading to a notable improvement for handling and application of indigoids. Based on this procedure a small set of 6,6\u2019-diarylindigos was isolated on a low milligram scale upon purification by column chromatography. Product identities were unambiguously con-firmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (cf. Supporting Information, Analytical Data). The HPLC data, instantly record-ed after isolation, corroborate sufficient product purity (cf. Sup-porting Information, Analytical Data). Notably, distinctly sepa-rated elution peaks occurred in RP-HPLC for all the diarylindi-gos under dilute acidic conditions giving different UV/Vis-spec-tra, but identical mass spectra. This observation indicates the Figure 3. A. Analytical-scale Suzuki\u2013Miyaura cross-coupling of crude 6,6\u2019-dibromoindigo (6,6\u2019-2) affording diarylindigo derivatives. B. HPLC (280 nm) of the presence of cis/trans isomers (Figures S13\u2013S15).[9] In general, N-unsubstituted indigos do not photoisomerize because of domi-nating and fast deactivation mechanisms.[55] On the other hand, under acidic conditions and in the gas phase a trans/cis-protoisomerization has been detected for indigo and its bis-imine derivatives.[55] The presence of the trans/cis-isomers in the diarylindigoids suggests that aryl substitutions at the indigo core reduce the double bond character of the central C=C bond, thus facilitating isomerization in the protonated state (Scheme S2).[55] NMR characterization of the aryl products proved challenging, probably as a consequence of the resul-tant low quantities along with isomerism and a potential light sensitivity. For example, 1H-and 13C-NMR signals could be clearly assigned for 6,6\u2019-8 and 6,6\u2019-10. Additional peaks detect-ed in the spectra originate from isomerization as well as minor impurities that were taken into account when calculating the yields (Table 1, Scheme 3). Cross-couplings using 5,5\u2019-2 were less efficient and potential products could not be isolated in satisfactory purities. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectra were recorded to study the spectroscopic properties of the novel diarylindigo derivatives. Substituents at the benzene ring of the indigo moiety do not have a pronounced effect on the UV/Vis absorption. + M Sub-stituents like halogens or methoxy groups at the 5,5\u2019-or 7,7\u2019-positions of indigo are supposed to cause a bathochromic shift, while at the 6,6\u2019-positions a hypsochromic shift is expect-ed. This characteristic is mainly known for Tyrian purple (6,6\u2019-2), which has its visible band at lower wavelengths than indigo (1).[56] In case of diarylindigoids, the aromatic rings mainly sta-bilize the coplanar conformation of the molecule with a mar-ginal mesomeric effect; however a fine-tuning of the maximal wavelength might be possible by changing the peripheral sub-stituents.[57] In DMSO, only diarylindigo 6,6\u2019-10 with the para-carboxy-methylbenzoic acid moiety shows an intense band in the deep red region at 626 nm similar to the band of 1 at 619 nm (Fig-ure 4 A, dashed line). Besides, a second intense band at 384 nm is different to the shoulder observed for indigo (1) at 333 nm. Another band appeared at 318 nm, while 1 shows a signal below 300 nm. Notably 6,6\u2019-10 is soluble in water, in which a strong hypsochromic effect was observed. The change of sol-vent from DMSO to water did not change the absorption maxi-mum at 624 nm. For the other arylindigo derivatives, a hypsochromic effect in comparison to indigo (1) was obvious. Trace amounts of water might be the reason, as 8 and 9 turned out to be rather hygro-scopic. The aminophenyl-substituted indigoid (6,6\u2019-9) shows strong hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts to 597 nm and 650 nm, respectively (Figure S16). On the contrary, the hydroxyaryl derivative (6,6\u2019-8) shows a different tendency with a maximum at 630 nm for 6,6\u2019-8. Generally, indigo and its derivatives often suffer from low fluorescence and low quantum yields due to a dominant radia-tionless decay (e.g. Figure S17).[55] Interestingly, 6,6\u2019-10 shows intense fluorescence emission at 664 nm that is even three times higher than that of indigo (1) under identical experimen-tal conditions (Figure 4 A, full line, Figure 4 C). However, in water this fluorescence band does not occur, so that 6,6\u2019-10 merely shows a significant emission at 425 nm pointing to an influence of the solvent on the fluorescence properties of this compound (Figure 4 B, full line). A qualitative comparison of the fluorescence intensity of the other 6,6\u2019-derivatives in DMSO Figure 4. Solvent-dependent UV/Vis absorbance (b) and fluorescence under comparable acquisition conditions showed that their fluorescence intensity at around 660 nm is marginal (Fig-ure 4 C).[58] The initial evaluation of the spectroscopic character-istics of the arylindigoids synthesized in this work reveals the complexity of their behavior indicating different patterns than those known for the reference compound 1. A profound evalu-ation of the observed photophysical properties, as well as their photoisomerization properties is in progress. In conclusion, sequential biocatalytic C@H activation imple-mented in a one-pot cascade enables stepwise transformation of tryptophan (3) into a versatile array of indigoids. Besides that, a facile synthesis of haloindoles was established that is suitable for a range of synthetic purposes. The modular cas-cade of multiple biocatalytic steps and acylation described here renders 5,5\u2019-and 6,6\u2019-dibromoindigo as easy-to-handle Boc-protected derivatives in good overall yields after four steps. Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling enabling diversification as the final reaction step was exemplified for a small set of 6,6\u2019-diaryl-indigos. In particular, cross-coupling using aryl halide 2 can be directly performed in the crude extract resulting from the pre-vious biotransformation. This chemoenzymatic route offers an alternative approach to previously reported approaches which make use of early-stage cross coupling instead.[57] Moreover, characterization of the novel indigoids unveils interesting pho-tophysical features. The methodology presented herein under-scores the potential of enzymatic halogenation and oxyfunc-tionalization for site-selective aryl diversification. The cascade offers an attractive means to manipulate indigoid properties towards applications in material science. In future, these tools will be expanded further using enzyme and reaction engineer-ing to provide sustainable access towards tailor-made, nature-derived materials.

        "Abstract: Indigoids represent natural product-based com-pounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photo-responsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. A biocatalytic ap-proach applying several consecutive selective C@H func-tionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l-tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5-, 6-and 7-bromoindoles. Subse-quent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase fur-nishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four-step one-pot cascade gives dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. Moreover, the halogen substituent allows for late-stage diversification by cross-coupling directly per-formed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of a small set of 6,6\u2019-diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzy-matic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.",
        "Indole is a widespread heterocycle found in many natural products.[1] For instance, indigo dyes derived from indole have been applied in textile dyeing for thousands of years due to their outstanding spectral properties.[2, 3] Indigo (1) developed to a bulk chemical in the last century whereas its C6-brominat-ed analogue, 6,6\u2019-dibromoindigo (6,6\u2019-2), the major component of the high-value pigment Tyrian purple, still remains a rarity (Scheme 1 A). Thanks to tremendous efforts by several research groups traditional indigoids recently turned into focus as natu-ral product-based, non-toxic materials for sustainable organic electronics.[4\u20136] Topical studies examining the photoswitching abilities of N,N\u2019-aryl-substituted indigos pointed to a useful strategy to tailor their photochemical properties.[7\u20139] Synthetic routes towards 1 were developed by Baeyer and by Heumann and paved the way to multi-ton production, yet its dibrominat-ed counterpart 2 has never entered an industrial scale produc-tion.[10]",
        "Today biocatalysis offers a versatile methodology to address selectivity issues, e.g. , arising from similarly reactive C@H moi-eties.[11] Recent advancements on enzyme discovery, engineer-ing as well as tremendous efforts on process development open up elaborate transformations that can be carried out under mild conditions, often with excellent selectivities.[12\u201314] Immense progress has been achieved in enzyme-catalyzed C@ H functionalization.[15] Especially oxyfunctionalization is a para-mount approach to activate C@H bonds by using biocatalysts that are capable of utilizing molecular oxygen. Manifold biocatalytic approaches in this rapidly evolving field, especially on the use of P450 enzymes, were extensively reviewed, giving a wide overview on the current state of the art.[16\u201319] The first fermentative synthesis of indigo was reported by Ensley and later by Lee et al. using a dioxygenase for indole hydroxylation. Tryptophanase that originated from endogenous tryptophan catabolism was exploited to obtain indole.[20, 21] Heme-depen-dent monooxygenases (MOs) were later evolved towards C3-hydroxylation of indole.[22\u201324] Flitsch et al. used formation of indigo-derived pigments for detecting activity of MO mu-tants.[25, 26] Biocatalytic functionalization of unprotected indole was achieved using engineered myoglobin variants which cata-lyze non-native carbene transfer in whole cells.[27] Besides using heme-dependent enzymes, also flavin-dependent MOs play a key role in oxyfunctionalization. Accordingly a flavin monooxygenase from Methylophaga sp. (mFMO) was estab-lished for the biotechnological production of indigo and indi-rubin.[28, 29] Nevertheless, the synthesis of valuable halogenated indigos has remained on analytical or small preparative scale, particularly due to the low efficiency of halogenases as a severe bottleneck. In more recent studies, Tischler and co-au-thors reported on the conversion of haloindoles using a small array of styrene MOs.[30] One-pot synthesis of indigoids either in bacteria or plant as the hosts was recently achieved: By in-troducing a tryptophan halogenase into the host strain along with a hydroxylase, production of indigoids from tryptophan was feasible, omitting the need for costly substituted indole substrates through exploiting the cellular metabolism.[31, 32] However, product titers remained low and the isolation of the pigment from the cultivation broth can become a tedious pro-cedure. Moreover, structural modifications that can be, for ex-",

        "We embarked on the development of a modular biocatalytic platform to afford the synthesis of haloindigo that can be easily isolated and/or diversified by addressing the halogen substituents using Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling. Assembly of the indigoid scaffold is achieved by stepwise C@H functionali-zation utilizing selective halogenation and hydroxylation start-ing from l-tryptophan (3, Scheme 1 B).[15] Various recent achievements underscore that flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases are capable of regioselective aryl halogenation using O2, FADH2 and a halide salt. [33, 34] Current efforts on random and targeted engineering, immobilization and combi-nation with chemocatalysis considerably extended the synthet-ic utility of these enzymes.[35\u201340] Recent reports also showcase applications of halogenases for the synthesis of valuable chem-icals using cascades in vivo and in vitro.[41@43] However, reports on enzymatic halogenation of free indole indicate that the substitution usually occurs in the electronically most favored C3 position.[44] To retain regioselectivity at the benzene ring, it is necessary to halogenate l-tryptophan (3) instead, since the toolkit of regiocomplementary halogenases allows to specifi-cally address the C5-, C6-, or C7-position of the indole moiety (Scheme 2).",
        "Formation of crosslinked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) ena-bles preparative-scale bromination of 3 resulting in product titers of 280 mg L@1. As demonstrated in earlier studies, CLEAs permit facile upscaling of the halogenation reaction. The bro-minated amino acid is selectively obtained whereas protein contaminants are simply filtered, therefore providing a good starting point for cascade reactions.[38] In the next step, trypto-phanase catalyzes the cleavage of the amino acid backbone to release bromoindole (5): In a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent reaction, a 1,4-elimination takes place leading to 5 and pyru-vate. The gene encoding the tryptophanase TnaA (EC 4.1.99.1) from E. coli was subcloned, and the resulting enzyme was uti-lized in biotransformations (Figure S1, S2).[45, 46] Initially, the ac-tivity of TnaA towards l-6-bromotryptophan (6-4) was con-firmed in analytical-scale reactions. Upon incubation of 6-4 with purified TnaA, 6-bromoindole (6-5) was successfully formed (Scheme S3). This motivated performing TnaA-cata-lyzed elimination preceded by enzymatic halogenation in a one-pot fashion on a milligram scale (Figure 1). After quantita-tive halogenation of 3 (0.1 mmol) using the C6-halogenase Thal along with auxiliary enzymes (combiCLEAs) a cell-free ex-tract containing overexpressed TnaA was simply added to the",
        "Scheme 1. A. Structure of natural indigo dyes and diversification strategies. B. Biocatalytic retrosynthesis of haloindigo via multiple steps of C@H functionaliza-",
        "biotransformation mixture. Moreover K2HPO4 was added to a final concentration of 50 mm because potassium cations were reported to have a positive impact on TnaA,[47] whilst K+ ions were omitted during halogenation to suppress undesired activ-ity of endogenous tryptophanase. By incubation for 24 h at 25 8C, >98 % of substrate was selectively converted into 6-bro-moindole (6-5), thus avoiding intermediary isolation of 6-4 (Figure 1 B). Notable side products did not occur, which indi-cates the high selectivity of the consecutive biotransformations to isolate haloindoles in two steps that can be hardly synthe-sized otherwise.",
        "By applying TnaA crude lysate, freeze-dried cells or CLEAs, haloindoles were afforded in quantities sufficient for multistep synthesis and characterization (Table 1; Figure S4). 5-, 6-, and 7-bromo isomers of 5 hence are obtained with >90 % conver-sion on larger scale. Solely, the TnaA loading had to be in-creased in case of 7-5, presumably due to a lower activity. Final isolation of 5 merely requires desalting over a plug of re-versed-phase silica leading to a satisfying product purity of >95 % (Figure S5). Application of this cascade provides 5-, 6-and 7-bromoindole (5) in good yields ranging from 60\u201370 % for two synthetic steps, starting from 3.",
        "Inspired by these results, 6-5 was subjected to enzyme-cata-lyzed C3-hydroxylation. The flavin-dependent monooxygenase (mFMO) from Methylophaga spp. was cloned and established for biocatalysis.[28] Enzyme assays carried out with 1 mm 6-5 and ADH/iso-propanol for concomitant NADPH regeneration initially gave a purplish suspension at 25 8C. Whilst the sub-strate was fully consumed, LC-MS indicated 6-bromo-3-hydroxyindole (6) as a minor species present (Figure S6A). Not surprisingly, under aerobic conditions, the hydroxylation of 6-5 directly initiates transformation of the hydroxylated intermedi-ate into the insoluble pigment 6,6\u2019-2. Despite low solubility in DMSO and poor ionization abilities, ESI-MS analysis of the col-ored sediment suggests the presence of 6,6\u2019-dibromoindigo (6,6\u2019-2) as the biotransformation product (Figure S6B).",
        "Encouraged by these results, the hydroxylation of 5 was fur-ther optimized to obtain an efficient process for the synthesis and isolation of halogenated indigo. Seminal achievements by Fraaije et al. inspired to generate a bifunctional biocatalyst by fusion of mFMO with phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH).[48\u201352] N-terminal PTDH genetically fused to mFMO is capable of NADPH regeneration by oxidation of phosphite while the monooxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation. In case of sub-strate 6-5, the self-sufficient enzyme reached a total conversion of approx. 96 % (HPLC), whereas other regeneration systems were less productive (Table S1). Comparing the substrate con-version under optimized conditions revealed that unsubstitut-ed indole causes a 2.5-fold higher TTN than its brominated de-rivatives (Scheme S1). However, both 5-and 6-bromoindole (5-/6-5) are being reasonably converted by PTDH-mFMO with a slight preference for the C6-isomer. Only 7-5 could not be con-verted into 7,7\u2019-dibromoindigo.",
        "The optimized biotransformation steps were combined to provide a one-pot cascade allowing stepwise transformation of 3 into dibromoindigo (2). In a sequential fashion, halogenation of 3 was followed by elimination and final hydroxylation simply by adding the enzymes and cofactors required for each step without isolation of reaction intermediates (Figure 2 A). Fi-nally, the hydroxylation step reached full conversion after 96 h on 0.1 mmol scale (Figure 2 B). Initial C6-halogenation using the halogenase Thal thus furnishes a purplish-colored solid",
        "Figure 1. A. One-pot synthesis of 5-, 6-, and 7-bromoindole, respectively, by",
        "pointing to the successful formation of 6,6\u2019-2 (Figure S8). Like-wise, the halogenase PyrH (C5 halogenation) results in 5,5\u2019-2 as a blue-colored pigment.",
        "As a consequence of its insolubility in aqueous medium, pig-ment 2 precipitates quantitatively and can be simply harvested by centrifugation. However, its isolation and purification from the biotransformation extract, e.g. , from protein precipitate, proves challenging due to its low solubility. In light of a previ-ous study by Sariciftci et al. , acylation of the indigo nitrogen enhances solubility by suppression of the intramolecular hy-drogen bonds.[53] Hence, subsequent to biocatalysis the crude solid was subjected to N,N\u2019-Boc protection. As a test system to obtain a suitable procedure applicable to cascade conditions, a crude extract containing 1 was first employed (cf. Supp. Inform. for further details, Table S2). According to these opti-mized conditions, Boc2O (15 equiv) and DMAP (3 equiv) were added to a freeze-dried crude extract containing 6,6\u2019-2 re-sus-pended in DMF, which led to formation of Boc-protected di-bromoindigo (7) after stirring for 3 d at r.t. as proven by LC-MS (Figure 2 C). The soluble 6,6\u2019-7 was purified by reversed-phase silica resulting in good purity and an overall yield of 24 % after four synthetic steps referring to starting compound 3 (Fig-ure 2 A; S9). The final Boc protection step could be optimized by portion-wise addition of Boc2O/DMAP and the use of CH2Cl2 as an alternative solvent. In total, the four-step cascade starting from 0.25 mmol of 3 resulted in an increased yield of 50 % on average, based on three independent replicates. Furthermore, a biotransformation on 0.50 mmol scale gave a comparable yield (52 %). Likewise, the cascade afforded 5,5\u2019-7 in a similar yield of 46 %. Taking into account that the final product 7 is fi-nally isolated after four sequential reactions, these results indi-cate a straightforward method towards haloindigos.",
        "We further embarked on investigations to diversify 2 by Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings. Aryl substitution of indigoids is a hitherto unexplored research area. Initially cross-coupling of Boc-protected 6,6\u2019-7 to the electron-rich 3-aminophenylboronic acid was attempted in order to enhance the polarity of the target compound and to facilitate detection by ESI-MS used as a simple reaction screening. However, as the brominated start-ing material was prone to Boc cleavage as well as decomposi-tion in basic medium hindering formation of the desired aryl species, we concentrated on arylation of 2 instead.",
        "Even though the cross-coupling of the insoluble unprotect-ed dibromoindigo (2) in the crude extract proved more chal-lenging, this approach would provide convenient diversifica-tion of the natural dye and potentially enhance solubility. 6-5 (1.0 mmol) was subjected to hydroxylation and the resulting crude precipitate containing 6,6\u2019-2 was incubated with 3-ami-nophenylboronic acid, Pd(sSPhos) and K3PO4 at 130 8C in a DMF suspension.",
        "Unexpectedly, LC-MS analysis indicated formation of a mono-methylated diarylindigo whereas dimethylation was not",

        "observed (Figure S10). Pd-catalyzed aniline N-methylation has been previously described.[54] Cross-coupling at lower tempera-ture (90 8C) in iPrOH under microwave irradiation in the pres-ence of 5 equiv of arylboronic acid, 0.1 equiv Na2PdCl4, 0.25 equiv sSPhos, and 6 equiv K3PO4 gave the unmethylated target compound, accompanied only by minor side products (Figure 3 A/B). Formation of the diarylindigo 6,6\u2019-8 succeeded when using 4-hydroxyphenylboronic acid: The target diarylin-digo among other cross-coupling components and homo-coupled product were detectable in the reaction solution as well as in the precipitate (Figure 3 B). Furthermore, MS analysis of the coupling reaction of 3-aminophenylboronic acid perfect-ly correlates with the twofold coupled aniline derivative 6,6\u2019-9 whilst not resulting in the methylated side product (Figures 3 C, S11, S12).",
        "To implement indigoid arylation within the cascade, 6,6\u2019-di-bromoindigo (6,6\u2019-2) was synthesized starting from 3. The crude extract was subjected to arylation under reflux and Ar atmosphere for 4 h to form diarylindigo. In addition to 6,6\u2019-8 and 6,6\u2019-9, the phenylacetic acid-substituted derivative 6,6\u2019-10 was obtained by using the corresponding boronic acid (Scheme 3). Its carboxylate salt is also soluble in aqueous basic medium leading to a notable improvement for handling and application of indigoids.",
        "Based on this procedure a small set of 6,6\u2019-diarylindigos was isolated on a low milligram scale upon purification by column chromatography. Product identities were unambiguously con-firmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (cf. Supporting Information, Analytical Data). The HPLC data, instantly record-ed after isolation, corroborate sufficient product purity (cf. Sup-porting Information, Analytical Data). Notably, distinctly sepa-rated elution peaks occurred in RP-HPLC for all the diarylindi-gos under dilute acidic conditions giving different UV/Vis-spec-tra, but identical mass spectra.

        "presence of cis/trans isomers (Figures S13\u2013S15).[9] In general, N-unsubstituted indigos do not photoisomerize because of domi-nating and fast deactivation mechanisms.[55] On the other hand, under acidic conditions and in the gas phase a trans/cis-protoisomerization has been detected for indigo and its bis-imine derivatives.[55] The presence of the trans/cis-isomers in the diarylindigoids suggests that aryl substitutions at the indigo core reduce the double bond character of the central C=C bond, thus facilitating isomerization in the protonated state (Scheme S2).[55] NMR characterization of the aryl products proved challenging, probably as a consequence of the resul-tant low quantities along with isomerism and a potential light sensitivity. For example, 1H-and 13C-NMR signals could be clearly assigned for 6,6\u2019-8 and 6,6\u2019-10. Additional peaks detect-ed in the spectra originate from isomerization as well as minor impurities that were taken into account when calculating the yields (Table 1, Scheme 3). Cross-couplings using 5,5\u2019-2 were less efficient and potential products could not be isolated in satisfactory purities.",
        "UV/Vis and fluorescence spectra were recorded to study the spectroscopic properties of the novel diarylindigo derivatives. Substituents at the benzene ring of the indigo moiety do not have a pronounced effect on the UV/Vis absorption. + M Sub-stituents like halogens or methoxy groups at the 5,5\u2019-or 7,7\u2019-positions of indigo are supposed to cause a bathochromic shift, while at the 6,6\u2019-positions a hypsochromic shift is expect-ed. This characteristic is mainly known for Tyrian purple (6,6\u2019-2), which has its visible band at lower wavelengths than indigo (1).[56] In case of diarylindigoids, the aromatic rings mainly sta-bilize the coplanar conformation of the molecule with a mar-ginal mesomeric effect; however a fine-tuning of the maximal wavelength might be possible by changing the peripheral sub-stituents.[57]",
        "In DMSO, only diarylindigo 6,6\u2019-10 with the para-carboxy-methylbenzoic acid moiety shows an intense band in the deep red region at 626 nm similar to the band of 1 at 619 nm (Fig-ure 4 A, dashed line). Besides, a second intense band at 384 nm is different to the shoulder observed for indigo (1) at 333 nm. Another band appeared at 318 nm, while 1 shows a signal below 300 nm. Notably 6,6\u2019-10 is soluble in water, in which a strong hypsochromic effect was observed. The change of sol-vent from DMSO to water did not change the absorption maxi-mum at 624 nm.",
        "For the other arylindigo derivatives, a hypsochromic effect in comparison to indigo (1) was obvious. Trace amounts of water might be the reason, as 8 and 9 turned out to be rather hygro-scopic. The aminophenyl-substituted indigoid (6,6\u2019-9) shows strong hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts to 597 nm and 650 nm, respectively (Figure S16). On the contrary, the hydroxyaryl derivative (6,6\u2019-8) shows a different tendency with a maximum at 630 nm for 6,6\u2019-8.",
        "Generally, indigo and its derivatives often suffer from low fluorescence and low quantum yields due to a dominant radia-tionless decay (e.g. Figure S17).[55] Interestingly, 6,6\u2019-10 shows intense fluorescence emission at 664 nm that is even three times higher than that of indigo (1) under identical experimen-tal conditions (Figure 4 A, full line, Figure 4 C). However, in water this fluorescence band does not occur, so that 6,6\u2019-10 merely shows a significant emission at 425 nm pointing to an influence of the solvent on the fluorescence properties of this compound (Figure 4 B, full line). A qualitative comparison of the fluorescence intensity of the other 6,6\u2019-derivatives in DMSO",
        "Figure 4. Solvent-dependent UV/Vis absorbance (b) and fluorescence",
        "under comparable acquisition conditions showed that their fluorescence intensity at around 660 nm is marginal (Fig-ure 4 C).[58] The initial evaluation of the spectroscopic character-istics of the arylindigoids synthesized in this work reveals the complexity of their behavior indicating different patterns than those known for the reference compound 1. A profound evalu-ation of the observed photophysical properties, as well as their photoisomerization properties is in progress.",
        "In conclusion, sequential biocatalytic C@H activation imple-mented in a one-pot cascade enables stepwise transformation of tryptophan (3) into a versatile array of indigoids. Besides that, a facile synthesis of haloindoles was established that is suitable for a range of synthetic purposes. The modular cas-cade of multiple biocatalytic steps and acylation described here renders 5,5\u2019-and 6,6\u2019-dibromoindigo as easy-to-handle Boc-protected derivatives in good overall yields after four steps. Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling enabling diversification as the final reaction step was exemplified for a small set of 6,6\u2019-diaryl-indigos. In particular, cross-coupling using aryl halide 2 can be directly performed in the crude extract resulting from the pre-vious biotransformation. This chemoenzymatic route offers an alternative approach to previously reported approaches which make use of early-stage cross coupling instead.[57] Moreover, characterization of the novel indigoids unveils interesting pho-tophysical features. The methodology presented herein under-scores the potential of enzymatic halogenation and oxyfunc-tionalization for site-selective aryl diversification. The cascade offers an attractive means to manipulate indigoid properties towards applications in material science. In future, these tools will be expanded further using enzyme and reaction engineer-ing to provide sustainable access towards tailor-made, nature-derived materials.",
