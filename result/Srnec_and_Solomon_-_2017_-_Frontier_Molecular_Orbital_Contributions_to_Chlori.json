Heyrovsky \u0301 Institute of Physical Chemistry, The Czech Academy of Sciences, Dolejsk\u030cova 2155/3, 182 23 Prague 8, Czech Republic *S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The ability of an FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate in SyrB2 to perform chlorination versus hydroxylation was computationally evaluated for different substrates that had been studied exper-imentally. The \u03c0-trajectory for H atom abstraction (FeIV\ue0c8O oriented perpendicular to the C-H bond of substrate) was found to lead to the S = 2 five-coordinate HO-FeIII-Cl complex with the C\u2022 of the substrate, \u03c0-oriented relative to both the Cl-and the OH-ligands. From this ferric intermediate, hydroxylation is thermody-namically favored, but chlorination is intrinsically more reactive due to the energy splitting between two key redox-active d\u03c0* frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). The splitting is determined by the differential ligand field effect of Cl-versus OH-on the Fe center. This makes chlorination effectively competitive with hydroxylation. Chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity is then determined by the orientation of the substrate with respect to the HO-Fe-Cl plane that controls either the Cl-or the OH-to rebound depending on the relative \u03c0-overlap with the substrate C radical. The differential contribution of the two FMOs to chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity in SyrB2 is related to a reaction mechanism that involves two asynchronous transfers: electron transfer from the substrate radical to the iron center followed by late ligand (Cl-or OH-) transfer to the substrate. 1. INTRODUCTION Mononuclear nonheme iron (NHFe) enzymes are crucial cat-alysts in many vital biological processes.1,2 Their high reactivity and selectivity toward chemical functionalization of unreactive C-H bonds have stimulated significant efforts from different fields of chemistry to elucidate their reaction mechanisms and the factors contributing to their enzymatic efficiency. One such NHFe enzyme is the chloride, O2, and \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent NHFe halogenase SyrB2. SyrB2 was discovered in the biosynthetic pathway of the phytotoxin syringomycin E (top of Scheme 1).3,4 SyrB2 was found to catalyze chlorination of the native substrate L-threonine that is attached to a small acyl carrier protein (ACP) through its phosphopanteteine linker. As for other members of the NHFe family, SyrB2 activates dioxygen to generate a high-spin (S = 2) FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate that further abstracts an H atom from the C-H bond of the substrate for its subsequent functionalization (chlorination in SyrB2). The FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate in SyrB2 was trapped and characterized using Mo\u0308ssbauer, Fe K-edge XAS, and EXAFS spectroscopies.5 The geometric structure of this inter-mediate was later defined using nuclear vibrational resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This study suggested a \u03c0-orientation of the oxo group relative to the native C-H bond (in this orientation, the oxo is oriented away from the substrate cavity as shown in Scheme 1, bottom right).6 The \u03c0-orientation was proposed to be an important prerequisite for chlorination. More recently, this \u03c0-orientation of the Fe-oxo axis relative to the substrate was also implied in a related NHFe halogenase, WelO5.7 Low-temperature magnetic circular dichroism Received: November 21, 2016 Published: January 18, 2017 Scheme 1. Proposed Catalytic Cycle of SyrB2 spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calcu-lations were used to define the electronic structure properties associated with geometric structure of the (SyrB2)FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate.8 The study revealed a \u03c0-anisotropy of the FeIV\ue0c8O bond with the enhanced \u03c0-reactivity in the direction of the substrate cavity. Besides chlorination, SyrB2 was also demon-strated to catalyze hydroxylation depending on the substrate9 or azidation/nitration if the non-native (N3 -or NO2 -) anions were present in SyrB2 (instead of Cl-).10 The substrate-dependent selectivity was attributed to a substrate positioning with respect to the Fe center.9,11 This was investigated by HYSCORE spec-troscopy applied to the {FeNO}7 complex in SyrB2 with dif-ferent deuteriated substrates.11 The perpendicular orientation of the NO group relative to the substrate is consistent with the previously defined \u03c0-orientation of the oxo group with respect to the substrate C-H bond.6 Reactivity and selectivity of the halogenase SyrB2 have also captivated the attention of theoretical groups.12-16 These com-putational studies proposed various reaction mechanisms for chlorination versus hydroxylation: (i) protonation of the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate to form Cl-FeIII-OH2; 12 (ii) con-comitant H atom abstraction and radical chlorination;13 (iii) propensity for hydroxylation versus halogenation dependent on the delivery of the substrate into the cavity;14 (iv) coordina-tion isomerism of the Cl-FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate;15 and (v) coor-dination isomerism of the Cl-FeIV-OH intermediate.16 How-ever, none of these calculations reflected the experimental data, in particular, the NRVS-determined structure of (SyrB2)FeIV\ue0c8 O,6 the X-ray characterization of the related halogenase WelO5,7 or substrate-dependent selectivity.9 In the present study, we build on our previous combined experimental and theoretical investigations of the geometric and electronic structures of FeIV\ue0c8O in SyrB2. The geometrical structural models of the active site of SyrB2 andDFT calculations calibrated to these results are employed to complete the catalytic cycle and provide insight into the key physicochemical factors contributing to chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity in SyrB2. 2. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS 2.1. Structural Model of SyrB2. The cluster models of the active site of SyrB2 in the presence of a substrate consist of one Fe center, the Cl-/OH-ligands (for the intermediate resulting from H atom abstraction by the FeIV\ue0c8O), one crystal water molecule, truncated (His116, His235, succinate) ligands, truncated second-shell (Arg254, Thr143, Glu102) residues, and a substrate radical fragment with the thiocarboxylic group (see Figure S1A). The truncated models with the L-threonine/L-norvaline/L-aminobutyric substrates consist of 89/89/86 atoms. Starting Cl-FeIII-OH structures for the chlorination and hydro-xylation reactions were prepared from the O2 activation and H atom abstraction steps as described in refs 6 and 8 (see also Figure S1B). 2.2. Density Functional Theory Calculations. Unless indicated otherwise, all DFT calculations were performed using the G09 program.17 The hybrid three-parameter Becke\u2019s (B3LYP)18 functional with the zero-damping empirical correction to dispersion (+D3)19 was used throughout. All of the geometry optimizations of the cluster models were carried out using the def2-SVP basis set, whereas the single-point energies were recomputed with the def2-TZVP basis set. In single-point calculations, to allow for solvation effects, the polarizable continuum model (PCM) was used with a dielectric constant reflecting the protein environment (\u03b5r = 4.0). In this case, the PCM appears to be a plausible approach as judged from the comparison with QM/MM calculations from ref 16 that provide reaction energies for chlorination versus hydroxylation that are comparable to results from this study. The smaller models used in section 3.3 were optimized in the gas phase at the B3LYP+D3/def2-TZVP level of theory. Reaction and activation Gibbs free energies were evaluated using vibrational analyses of systems with fixed atoms20 according to the equation: \u0394 = \u0394 + \u0394 -\u0394\u29e7 \u29e7 \u29e7 \u29e7 \u29e7 \u29e7G E E RT q q qln( ) el,solv ( ) ZPE ( ) vib ( ) rot ( ) trans ( ) where \u0394Eel,solv(\u29e7) is the reaction (or activation) energy of the solvated system (at the B3LYP+D3/def2-TZVP/PCM(\u03b5r=4.0)//B3LYP+D3/ def2-SVP level), \u0394EZPE(\u29e7) is the change in zero-point energy, and -RT\u0394 ln qvib (\u29e7)qrot (\u29e7)qtrans (\u29e7) accounts for the change in the reaction (or activation) entropic terms and the thermal correction to the enthalpy as obtained from a frequency calculation (at 298 K, 1 atm; ideal-gas approximation) on top of optimized geometries. Constrained density functional theory (cDFT)21 was employed using the NWChem 6.1.1 program.22 The single-point cDFT (and related) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP/COSMO (\u03b5 = 4.0) level of theory on top of B3LYP+D3/def2-SVP/PCM (\u03b5 = 4.0) optimized geometries obtained from the G09 program. For the COSMO in theNWChem program, the atomic radii were set to 1.3 (H), 1.83 (N), 1.72 (O), 2.00 (C), 2.05 (Cl), 2.6 (S), and 2.223 \u00c5 (Fe), and the solvent-accessible surface to 0.5 \u00c5. 3. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 3.1. Chlorination versus Hydroxylation: The Native L-Threonine Substrate. The FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate with the oxo group oriented away from the substrate cavity was suggested in ref 6 to cleave the C-H bond of the native substrate via a \u03c0-attack (see Introduction). This would lead to an HO-FeIII-Cl intermediate poised for chlorination due to the shorter distance between the substrate carbon radical and the Cl-ligand relative to the OH-ligand (by \u223c0.5 \u00c5 considering ionic radii). Alter-natively, with the oxo group oriented toward the substrate cavity, H atom abstraction (HAA) would proceed via a \u03c3-attack to produce an HO-FeIII-Cl intermediate poised for hydroxylation due to the favorable distance between C\u2022 and OH-relative to the Cl-(by \u223c0.5 \u00c5 considering ionic radii).6 Indeed, for the \u03c3-trajectory of the C-H bond activation, the Gibbs free energy barriers (\u0394G\u29e7) for the chlorination versus hydroxylation pathways were calculated to be 9.6 versus 3.3 kcal mol-1 (Figure S2). Alter-natively, starting from the product of the \u03c0 pathway of ref 6 (1Thr in Figure 1), chlorination versus hydroxylation from the HO-FeIII-Cl intermediate have essentially the same \u0394G\u29e7 values (5.5 vs 5.7 kcal mol-1 from Figure S2B). However, a small conformational change in the substrate starting from 1Thr gives the structure 2Thr (Figure 1) that is more stable by 2.3 kcal mol-1. 2Thrmaintains the \u03c0 orientation and has a more pronounced asymmetry between the C\u2022---Cl-and C\u2022---OH-distances with Cl-closer to the C\u2022 relative to OH-by \u223c1.3 \u00c5 (considering ionic radii; see Figure S3A). Starting from 2Thr, chlorination was found to be lower in energy than hydroxylation by \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 = 1.5 kcal mol-1 (\u0394\u0394E\u29e7/\u0394\u0394H\u29e7 = 0.4/1.4 kcalmol-1) despite the larger thermodynamic driving force for hydroxylation that is favored by \u0394\u0394G0 = 8.4 kcal mol-1 (\u0394\u0394E0/\u0394\u0394H0 = 12/10 kcal mol-1, at right in Figure 1). The fact that the product of hydroxylation is \u223c10 kcal mol-1 more stable than the product of chlorination is attributed to the stronger C-OH bond (cf., the experimental bond dissociation enthalpy of C-OH vs C-Cl in C2H5OH vs C2H5Cl is 94 vs 84 kcal mol-1). 23 These results are in contrast to the expectation based on the Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle that predicts a lower barrier for a more exergonic (exothermic) reaction. To evaluate the \u201cnet\u201d effect of non-thermodynamic con-tributions to the barriers of chlorination and hydroxylation from 2Thr, Marcus theory 24 was employed (Figure 2). Using this theory, the calculated activation energy \u0394E\u29e7 is a function of the reaction energy and the intrinsic activation energy (\u0394E0 and Journal of the American Chemical Society Article DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b11995 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 2396-2407 2397 \u0394E\u29e7int along the horizontal and vertical axes in Figure 2, respectively), the latter corresponding to the activation energy of a \u201cthermo-neutralized\u201d reaction. Thus, from Figure 2 (and its correlation to the calculations in Figure 1, see caption), \u201cthermo-neutralized\u201d chlorination (starting from 2Thr) is favored over \u201cthermo-neutralized\u201d hydroxylation by \u0394\u0394E\u29e7int = 4.6 kcal mol-1 (\u0394\u0394H\u29e7int/\u0394\u0394G\u29e7int of 5.2/4.8 kcal mol-1). Alternatively, as can be inferred from the plot in Figure 2 (point \u00d7), hydroxylation would be favored over chlorination by \u223c4 kcal mol-1 if chlorination had the same intrinsic barrier as hydroxylation of 20.5 kcal mol-1 (i.e., for \u0394\u0394E\u29e7int = 0 kcal mol-1, hydro-xylation is favored by its thermodynamic contribution). Importantly, this analysis shows that chlorination, in comparison to hydroxylation, is intrinsically more accessible, which more than compensates for its lower exothermicity. Geometric and electronic factors that contribute in SyrB2 to halogenation over hydroxylation selectivity for the native substrate are analyzed below. In considering the factors controlling selectivity, the geometric structures of 2Thr (Figure 1) and the transition states of chlorina-tion and hydroxylation (labeled TSCl and TSOH in Figure 1) are evaluated first. In 2Thr, the Fe III ion is centered in the square pyramidal (SP) ligand field, with both the Cl-and the OH-equatorial and cis to each other (the z-axis is the open position of the five-coordinate SP FeIII center). The Fe-Cl and Fe-OH vectors are thus mutually perpendicular. As for the substrate location, the C radical is closer to Cl-than to OH-(as indicated earlier), above the Fe-Cl bond vector, perpendicular to the Cl-Fe-OHplane, and trans to the axial histidine ligand. In going from 2Thr to TSCl, there is no significant change in the SP arrangement around the FeIII center. Notably the Fe-Cl bond elongates by only 0.03 \u00c5 (from 2.35 to 2.38 \u00c5), while the C\u2022 shifts from 3.64 to 2.72 \u00c5 with respect to the Cl-, remaining perpendicular to the Cl-Fe-OH plane. Similarly, the FeIII in TSOH maintains its SP ligand field with no change in the Fe-OH bond length relative to 2Thr (1.90 \u00c5), but the C \u2022 shifts from Figure 1. Chlorination versus hydroxylation (in green vs red) from the Cl-FeIII(S = 5/2)-OH product of the H atom abstraction pathway (black), 4.45 to 2.44 \u00c5 from the OH-so that the C\u2022---OH vector becomes perpendicular to the Cl-Fe-OHplane with C\u2022 located above OH-(see Figure 1, and expanded structures are given in Figure S3B). With respect to electronic structure contributions to the intrinsic barriers, the key FMOs are given in Figure 3. Given the C\u2022 position with respect to the Cl-or OH-ligand at TSCl or TSOH (desribed above), the respective \u03b2-HOMOs are identified as the \u03b2-p(C\u2022) orbital with admixture of \u03b2-d\u03c0* along either the Fe-Cl or the Fe-OH bond (Figure 3A), while the respective \u03b2-LUMOs have the \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-Cl or \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-OH character mixed with the \u03b2-p(C\u2022) (Figure 3A). From Figure 3, there are two dif-ferent orthogonal, electron-accepting Fe-d\u03c0* orbitals, one along the Fe-Cl axis and one along the Fe-OH axis, both perpendicular to the Cl-Fe-OH plane. These are suggested to play key roles in the chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity of SyrB2. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3B, the energies of these \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-Cl and \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-OH orbitals at 2Thr (in the absence of the substrate C\u2022) differ by 4.5 kcal mol-1, with d\u03c0*Fe-Cl lying lower in energy. This energy difference between the two FMOs is similar to the difference between the intrinsic activation energies of chlorination and hydroxylation (i.e., 4.6 kcal mol-1 in favor of chlorination, Figure 2). It is this energy difference between two crucial FMOs that makes chlorination kinetically competitive with hydroxylation; the hydroxylation would otherwise have an activation barrier lower by \u223c4 kcal mol-1 due to the larger exothermicity of the hydroxylated product. Up to this point, the intrinsic selectivity versus the energy splitting between two FMOs is an empirical correlation that is further evaluated in section 3.3 and is related to the mechanism of Figure 3. (A) Frontier molecular orbitals, \u03b2-HOMO and \u03b2-LUMO, and their atomic composition at the TSCl and TSOH structures from Figure 1. chlorination/hydroxylation that is analyzed in section 3.4. Effects that destabilize Fe-d\u03c0* along the Fe-OH bond relative to the Fe-d\u03c0* along the Fe-Cl bond in SyrB2 are analyzed in section 3.3. 3.2. Orientation Dependence of Chlorination versus Hydroxylation. From ref 6, the \u03c3-pathway for H atom abstraction by (SyrB2)FeIV\ue0c8O, with the oxo oriented toward the substrate L-Thr, was proposed to result in substrate hydro-xylation because of the favorable C\u2022---OH distance. This predic-tion was confirmed in section 3.1 (from Table 1, hydroxylation is favored by \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 of -6.3 kcal mol-1 for \u03c3-Thr). In agreement with this, when the non-native substrate L-norvaline (Nva) was evaluated with a \u03c3 orientation for HAA (oxo toward the sub-strate cavity), both the terminal C5 and the adjacent C4 sites in Nva were found to result in a lower Gibbs free-energy barrier for hydroxylation relative to chlorination by \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 = -2.3 kcal mol-1 at C5 and by -0.4 kcal mol-1 at C4 (\u03c3-NvaC5/ C4 in Table 1). These findings clearly demonstrate that the \u03c3-trajectory for HAA performed by the oxo that is oriented toward the substrate leads to the C\u2022/HO-FeIII-Cl inter-mediate, from which hydroxylation is favored. In contrast, from section 3.1, the \u03c0-trajectory for the native L-Thr leads to an intermediate with the OH-oriented away from the substrate radical, favoring chlorination (2Thr in Table 1). Here, we have also evaluated the \u03c0-orientation for the C5 and C4 sites of Nva. For this orientation, while chlorination does mostly occur on the C4 site (\u0394G\u29e7 = 7.0 vs 5.9 kcal mol-1 for hydroxylation vs chlorination; NvaC4 in Table 1), Nva is in fact found to be preferably hydroxylated at C5 (\u0394G\u29e7 = 5.0 vs 5.5 kcal mol-1 for hydroxylation vs chlorination; NvaC5 in Table 1). The energetics of the hydroxylation/chlorination pathways associated with the \u03c0-channel for HAA from Nva are in fact in better agreement with the experimental data than those associated with the \u03c3-channel: experimentally, the C5 site is more hydroxylated (95% of the hydroxylated product),9 while the C4 site is more chlorinated (65%).9 Another non-native substrate, L-amino-butyric acid that is experimentally known to be hydroxylated/ chlorinated in a ratio of 69:31%,9 was also calculated. The \u03c0-trajectory has essentially equivalent barriers for hydroxylation and chlorination, while the \u03c3-channel leads to hydroxyla-tion (Aba vs \u03c3-Aba in Table 1). Thus, the \u03c0-channel for HAA, which is a required prerequisite for the less thermodynamically favorable chlorination (as analyzed in section 3.1), can also allow hydroxylation. Importantly, such a change in selectivity with the \u03c0-orientation does not reflect either a difference in the thermo-dynamics of hydroxylation versus chlorination (\u0394\u0394G0), as these are approximately the same for all of the systems studied (see Figure S2), or a difference in ligand field, as this remains the same over the series (all having five-coordinate square-pyramidal FeIII-hydroxy centers). An effect that tunes the reaction selectivity in these \u03c0-oriented systems enabling either chlorination or hydroxylation is the orientation of the substrate C\u2022 with respect to the Cl-Fe-OH plane. Its orientation, defined by the dihedral angle \u03b1 between the plane containing C\u2022---Cl vector and the Cl-Fe-OH plane, varies for the different C\u2022/HO-FeIII-Cl \u03c0-oriented intermedi-ates from 72\u00b0 (2Thr) through 69\u00b0 (NvaC4), 56\u00b0 (Aba), and 51\u00b0 (1Thr) to 41\u00b0 (NvaC5). For chlorination (from the calculations given in Figure S2), the C\u2022 at TSCl maintains roughly the same orientation as in the associated intermediate (\u03b1 = 79\u00b0, 62\u00b0, 51\u00b0, 50\u00b0, and 44\u00b0). Alternatively, for hydroxylation, \u03b1 is very similar at all of the TSOH structures (falling in the range between 42\u00b0 and 36\u00b0). Thus, the orientation dependence of \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 is correlated with the angle \u03b1 (essentially the same in the reactant and the TSCl) and reflects the amount the intermediate has to distort to reach the TSOH structure (the larger is the distortion, the more positive is \u0394\u0394G\u29e7). From the \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 versus \u03b1 plot in Figure 4A, chlorination (green arrow) exhibits the largest preference for the most perpendicular orientation of the C\u2022---Cl vector relative to the Cl-Fe-OH plane (72\u00b0 at 2Thr), whereas hydroxylation is mostly preferred in the NvaC5 system, which has the most parallel orientation of C\u2022---Cl vector to the Cl-Fe-OH plane at the intermediate (44\u00b0). For the Aba system that has an inter-mediate orientation between those in NvaC5 and 2Thr (56\u00b0 in Figure 4A), chlorination and hydroxylation have comparable \u0394G\u29e7 values. The fact that these correlations reflect the amount of reactant\u2192 TSOH distortion is further supported by the analyses in Figure 4B. This gives the distortion energy (\u0394Edistortion) for hydroxylation (red) and chlorination (green), which is defined as Figure 4. (A) Orientation dependence of chlorination versus the energy required for distorting a substrate and the active site of SyrB2 to reach the transition state geometry, plotted against the angle \u03b1. For hydroxylation, the\u0394Edistortion increases with \u03b1, while for chlorination it remains approximately the same (the green line). Thus, the differential distortion energy \u0394\u0394Edistortion (black line in Figure 4B) exhibits a slope similar to that of\u0394Edistortion for hydroxylation (red line in Figure 4B), with \u0394\u0394Edistortion having a trend similar to that of \u0394\u0394G\u29e7, that is, both favoring hydro-xylation in the NvaC5 system and chlorination in 2Thr and NvaC4. The difference in distortion energy required for reaching TSOH versus TSCl is linked to a difference in how much the d\u03c0*FeCl versus d\u03c0*FeOH FMO distorts away from its perpendicular orientation relative to the HO-Fe-Cl plane upon the overlap with the substrate radical. In Figure 5, the two FMOs, d\u03c0*FeCl and d\u03c0*FeOH (the first and third columns), are displayed at the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate geometries in the presence of different substrates (each row for one substrate). Following the chlorination pathway (going from the first to second column), the d\u03c0*FeCl \u03c0-overlaps with the substrate p orbital (the \u03b2-HOMO in the second column). From the comparison of all of the \u03b2-HOMOs in the second column of Figure 5, the deviation of the p orbital from its perpendicular orientation relative to the HO-Fe-Cl plane increases with the decrease in the angle \u03b1. Consequently, the orientation of d\u03c0*FeCl follows the rotation of the C\u2022 along the Fe-Cl bond to maximize its overlap with the p(C\u2022) orbital. This adaptability in the orientation of d\u03c0*FeCl is attributed to the p(C\u2022)-mediated orbital mixing between d\u03c0*yz (from Figure 3) and the higher-energy d\u03c0*xy (axes defined in Figure 3B) that increases with the decrease in \u03b1 (Table S2). For hydroxylation, where the d\u03c0*FeOH \u03c0-overlaps with the substrate p orbital at TSOH, the d\u03c0*FeOH is also rotated to achieve good overlap with the substrate p(C\u2022) orbital (from the third to fourth column in Figure 5). However, the d\u03c0*FeOH rotation is limited and approximately the same for all systems (see the \u03b2-HOMOs in the fourth column of Figure 5). This is rationalized by the limited flexibility in the OH ligand vector orientation, which is anchored by an H-bond to the neighboring monodentate carboxylate group and one from the nearby (crystallographic) water molecule (Table S3). This results in a similar angle \u03b1 for all calculated TSOH\u2019s, and the change in selectivity is therefore mostly given by how much the intermediate has to distort to reach TSOH. 3.3. Ligand Field Effects on FMOs and Their Con-tributions to Selectivity. The difference between intrinsic activation barriers of chlorination and hydroxylation (starting from 2Thr in Figure 1) was linked in section 3.1 to the energy difference between two FMOs: d\u03c0*Fe-OH and d\u03c0*Fe-Cl. In this section, this correlation is elaborated using small structural Figure 5. Two d\u03c0*FeCl and d\u03c0*FeOH FMOs at the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate geometries (the first and third columns, respectively), as calculated for models to elucidate how ligand-field effects on the two FMOs correlate with intrinsic reactivity. The trend in the intrinsic barrier favoring chlorination with the energy splitting of the d\u03c0*Fe-Cl/d\u03c0*Fe-OH FMOs was developed using a series of structures with two cis-positioned ligands, Cl-and X = F-, OH-, Cl-, Br-, and I-(structures 1-X in Figure 6). For these structures, the intrinsic barriers for chlorination versus halogenation (fluorination to iodination) were calculated as described in Figure S6 with a methyl radical positioned perpen-dicular to the transferring atom and correlated with the energy splitting of the d\u03c0*Fe-Cl/d\u03c0*Fe-X FMOs. This correlation is given in Figure 6. For I, the \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-I orbital is \u223c5 kcal mol-1 lower in energy than \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-Cl (at 0 kcal mol -1 on the abscisa), which directly correlates with the low intrinsic barrier for iodination versus chlorination, favoring iodination by \u223c4 kcal mol-1. In contrast, the \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-F orbital in 1-F is\u223c4 kcal mol-1 higher in energy than \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-Cl and has the highest intrinsic barrier (for fluorination) as compared to chlorination by \u223c5 kcal mol-1. Thus, the \u0394FMO (=E[d\u03c0*xz,Fe-X] -E[d\u03c0*yz,Fe-Cl]) correlates with intrinsic reactivity, and we can now consider the ligand field (LF) factors that influence \u0394FMO for a series of FeIIICl/X (=OH, F, Cl, Br, I) complexes. First, LF geometries were varied as shown in Figure S7, where calculations of the FMO energy splitting for octahedral (O) versus square-pyramidal (SP) versus trigonal-bipyramidal (TBP) structures show that there is no significant dependence on the structure (\u0394FMO = 4.2, 3.1, 4.1 kcal mol-1 for O vs SP vs TBP). Next, for a group of five-coordinate square-pyramidal structures [(NH3)3(X)Fe IIICl with X = OH-, F-, Cl-, Br-, and I-], we systematically varied the pair of Cl-/X-cis-equatorial ligands as given in Figure 7. Within this series, the FMO energy splitting varies in a manner similar to that in Figure 6. This allows evaluation of the relative contributions of \u03c0 Figure 8. (A) The gas-phase thermodynamic cycle for chlorination of the CH3 where IX is the ionization potential of X, cX 2 is defined above, and E\u03c0,Fe-Cl is the \u03c0-donation contribution to the destabilization energy of the d\u03c0*Fe-Cl that is assumed to be positive for \u03c0-donation into a d\u03c0* orbital. Importantly, for a positive value of E\u03c0,Fe-Cl (>\u223c2 kcal mol-1), the E\u03c0,Fe-I and E\u03c0,Fe-Br are always larger than the E\u03c0,Fe-Cl, while the opposite is true for the E\u03c0,Fe-F and E\u03c0,Fe-OH (see Figure S8). However, this is not the trend reflected in \u0394FMO, where d\u03c0*Fe-I and d\u03c0*Fe-Br are lower in energy than d\u03c0*Fe-Cl, while d\u03c0*Fe-OH and d\u03c0*Fe-F are higher (Figure 7). Considering the fact that X-and Cl-ligands in the complexes in Figure 7 are both trans to the \u03c3-donating ligand NH3, we can also exclude a trans effect contribution to\u0394FMO. The trend in \u0394FMO does however correlate with differences in the strength of the ligand field. This can be estimated from the relative partial Mulliken charges of the X-versus Cl-ligand, as given by the qX/qCl quantity at the bottom row of Figure 7. These reflect the fact that lower electron donation leads to more negative charge on the ligand. From Figure 7, while OH-is a weaker \u03c0-donor than Cl-, it is associated with a stronger LF, which leads to a higher-energy d\u03c0*Fe-OH as compared to the d\u03c0*Fe-Cl orbital. 3.4. Possible Mechanisms of Chlorination and Hydrox-ylation. We first consider a \u201crebound\u201d mechanism. Within this process, the FeIII-Cl (FeIII-OH) bond would undergo homo-lytic cleavage, producing the Cl\u2022 (OH\u2022) moiety that recombines with the substrate C\u2022. Figure 8 presents thermodynamic cycles for the chlorination and hydroxylation reactions in Figure S6A that include the two sequential steps, homolysis and recombi-nation. From a comparison of the two cycles, homolysis of the FeIII-Cl bond is 12 kcal mol-1 less favorable than homolytic cleavage of the FeIII-OH bond (cf., \u0394E1 values in Figure 8A and B), which qualitatively parallels the experimental (and calculated) ionization potentials of Cl-and OH-(IP[Cl-\u2192 Cl\u2022)] = 3.623 (3.3) eV; IP[OH-\u2192 OH\u2022)] = 1.823 (1.2) eV). Also, the recombination of the radicals (\u0394E2 in Figure 8) is calculated to favor hydroxylation by \u223c11 kcal mol-1 (cf., the experimental bond dissociation energy of CH3-Cl vs CH3-OH is 83 vs 92 kcal mol-1).23 From these numbers, chlorination would not compete with hydroxylation. Another possible mechanism would correspond to a process in which the FeIII-Cl (FeIII-OH) bond spin polarizes to FeII-Cl\u2022 (FeII-OH\u2022) upon the attack of the substrate. Figure 9A presents the reaction coordinate for chlorination from 2Thr from right to left that includes the DFT potential energy surface (PES) of the electronic ground state (green curve). The analogous PES for hydroxylation is shown in Figure 9B (red curve). Constrained density functional theory (cDFT) allows localization of the spin density along the reaction coordinate. Thus, cDFT is suitable for the evaluation of the energy required for FeIII-X\u2192 FeII-X\u2022 spin polarization along the reaction coordinate in Figure 9. Within the cDFT approach, an FeII-X\u2022 state can be optimized by con-straining one unpaired \u03b1 electron on X (=Cl or OH), four unpaired \u03b1 electrons on Fe, and one unpaired \u03b2 electron on the substrate. This constraint, maintained along the chlorination and hydroxylation reaction coordinates, allows for construction of \u201cdiabatic\u201d PESs of the spin-polarized FeII-Cl\u2022 and FeII-OH\u2022 states (mangenta curves in Figure 9A and B). From valence bond theory, a diabatic state preserves its character with a change in a molecular geometry. This differs from an adiabatic state that can be considered as a linear combination of diabatic states with weights that change with molecular geometry. Thus, the adiabatic ground-state PES (reaction barrier in green and red in Figure 9A and B) should result from a strong configuration with the correlation of selectivity to the energy splitting between the two redox-active FMOs. 4. DISCUSSION Considering a \u03c3-trajectory for the H atom abstraction reaction (with the oxo oriented toward the substrate cavity), hydrox-ylation is found to be favored over chlorination for all substrates investigated in this study (section 3.2; see also Scheme 2A). Thus, this \u03c3-trajectory cannot be operative in SyrB2 in the presence of the native substrate L-Thr that is predominantly chlorinated. Instead, as was already reported in refs 6 and 8, the HAA pathway with the L-Thr is suggested to follow the \u03c0-trajectory (with the oxo oriented perpendicular to the substrate cavity). Following the \u03c0-trajectory for HAA in SyrB2 with different substrates, the reaction barrier of chlorination is calcu-lated to be comparable (and in some cases favored) to that of the more thermodynamically favored hydroxylation (Scheme 2A). This is associated with a higher intrinsic reactivity toward chlorination due to the lower intrinsic activation barrier (by 4-5 kcal mol-1) as determined by a Marcus theory analysis (section 3.1). Thus, the intrinsic preference for chlorination compensates the thermodynamic propensity for hydroxylation. The difference between intrinsic activation barriers for the \u201cthermo-neutralized\u201d chlorination and hydroxylation reactions correlates to the energy difference between two key frontier molecular orbitals (sections 3.1 and 3.3). One of these FMOs, which results from the antibonding \u03c0-interaction along the Fe-Cl bond axis (d\u03c0*Fe-Cl), is active in chlorination and is \u223c4-5 kcalmol-1 lower in energy than the FMOactive in hydroxylation, arising from the analogous antibonding interaction along the Fe-OH bond axis (d\u03c0*Fe-OH). These two FMOs are depicted in Figure 3. The FMO energy splitting \u0394FMO agreement with the experimental observations from ref 9. The \u03c0-trajectory for H atom abstraction as defined in refs 6 and 8 was calculated to lead to the S = 2 five-coordinate HO-FeIII-Cl intermediate with the C\u2022 substrate, \u03c0-oriented relative to both the Cl-and the OH-ligands. Starting from this ferric inter-mediate, hydroxylation is thermodynamically favored, but chlorination is intrinsically more reactive. A higher intrinsic chlorination reactivity derives from the energy splitting between two key redox-active d\u03c0* FMOs: the lower is the FMO energy for chlorination relative to that for hydroxylation, the higher is the intrinsic reactivity for chlorination. The orbital splitting arises from the differential ligand-field effect of Cl-versus OH-on the Fe d\u03c0* orbitals. This factor makes chlorination effectively com-petitive with hydroxylation. Chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity is then determined by the orientation of the substrate C\u2022 with respect to the HO-Fe-Cl plane that is related to the differential overlap of the substrate p orbital with two d\u03c0* FMOs. The differential contribution of the FMOs to chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity in SyrB2 is related to a reaction mech-anism that employs two asynchronous transfers: electron transfer from the substrate radical to the iron center followed by late ligand (Cl-or OH-) transfer to the substrate.

        "ABSTRACT: The ability of an FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate in SyrB2 to perform chlorination versus hydroxylation was computationally evaluated for different substrates that had been studied exper-imentally. The \u03c0-trajectory for H atom abstraction (FeIV\ue0c8O oriented perpendicular to the C-H bond of substrate) was found to lead to the S = 2 five-coordinate HO-FeIII-Cl complex with the C\u2022 of the substrate, \u03c0-oriented relative to both the Cl-and the OH-ligands. From this ferric intermediate, hydroxylation is thermody-namically favored, but chlorination is intrinsically more reactive due to the energy splitting between two key redox-active d\u03c0* frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). The splitting is determined by the differential ligand field effect of Cl-versus OH-on the Fe center. This makes chlorination effectively competitive with hydroxylation. Chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity is then determined by the orientation of the substrate with respect to the HO-Fe-Cl plane that controls either the Cl-or the OH-to rebound depending on the relative \u03c0-overlap with the substrate C radical. The differential contribution of the two FMOs to chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity in SyrB2 is related to a reaction mechanism that involves two asynchronous transfers: electron transfer from the substrate radical to the iron center followed by late ligand (Cl-or OH-) transfer to the substrate.",
        "1. INTRODUCTION Mononuclear nonheme iron (NHFe) enzymes are crucial cat-alysts in many vital biological processes.1,2 Their high reactivity and selectivity toward chemical functionalization of unreactive C-H bonds have stimulated significant efforts from different fields of chemistry to elucidate their reaction mechanisms and the factors contributing to their enzymatic efficiency. One such NHFe enzyme is the chloride, O2, and \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent NHFe halogenase SyrB2.",
        "SyrB2 was discovered in the biosynthetic pathway of the phytotoxin syringomycin E (top of Scheme 1).3,4 SyrB2 was found to catalyze chlorination of the native substrate L-threonine that is attached to a small acyl carrier protein (ACP) through its phosphopanteteine linker. As for other members of the NHFe family, SyrB2 activates dioxygen to generate a high-spin (S = 2) FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate that further abstracts an H atom from the C-H bond of the substrate for its subsequent functionalization (chlorination in SyrB2). The FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate in SyrB2 was trapped and characterized using Mo\u0308ssbauer, Fe K-edge XAS, and EXAFS spectroscopies.5 The geometric structure of this inter-mediate was later defined using nuclear vibrational resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This study suggested a \u03c0-orientation of the oxo group relative to the native C-H bond (in this orientation, the oxo is oriented away from the substrate cavity as shown in Scheme 1, bottom right).6 The \u03c0-orientation was proposed to be an important prerequisite for chlorination. More recently, this \u03c0-orientation of the Fe-oxo axis relative to the substrate was also implied in a related NHFe halogenase, WelO5.7 Low-temperature magnetic circular dichroism",

        "spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calcu-lations were used to define the electronic structure properties associated with geometric structure of the (SyrB2)FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate.8 The study revealed a \u03c0-anisotropy of the FeIV\ue0c8O bond with the enhanced \u03c0-reactivity in the direction of the substrate cavity. Besides chlorination, SyrB2 was also demon-strated to catalyze hydroxylation depending on the substrate9 or azidation/nitration if the non-native (N3 -or NO2 -) anions were present in SyrB2 (instead of Cl-).10 The substrate-dependent selectivity was attributed to a substrate positioning with respect to the Fe center.9,11 This was investigated by HYSCORE spec-troscopy applied to the {FeNO}7 complex in SyrB2 with dif-ferent deuteriated substrates.11 The perpendicular orientation of the NO group relative to the substrate is consistent with the previously defined \u03c0-orientation of the oxo group with respect to the substrate C-H bond.6",
        "Reactivity and selectivity of the halogenase SyrB2 have also captivated the attention of theoretical groups.12-16 These com-putational studies proposed various reaction mechanisms for chlorination versus hydroxylation: (i) protonation of the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate to form Cl-FeIII-OH2; 12 (ii) con-comitant H atom abstraction and radical chlorination;13 (iii) propensity for hydroxylation versus halogenation dependent on the delivery of the substrate into the cavity;14 (iv) coordina-tion isomerism of the Cl-FeIV\ue0c8O intermediate;15 and (v) coor-dination isomerism of the Cl-FeIV-OH intermediate.16 How-ever, none of these calculations reflected the experimental data, in particular, the NRVS-determined structure of (SyrB2)FeIV\ue0c8 O,6 the X-ray characterization of the related halogenase WelO5,7 or substrate-dependent selectivity.9",

The cluster models of the active site of SyrB2 in the presence of a substrate consist of one Fe center, the Cl-/OH-ligands (for the intermediate resulting from H atom abstraction by the FeIV\ue0c8O), one crystal water molecule, truncated (His116, His235, succinate) ligands, truncated second-shell (Arg254, Thr143, Glu102) residues, and a substrate radical fragment with the thiocarboxylic group (see Figure S1A). The truncated models with the L-threonine/L-norvaline/L-aminobutyric substrates consist of 89/89/86 atoms. Starting Cl-FeIII-OH structures for the chlorination and hydro-xylation reactions were prepared from the O2 activation and H atom abstraction steps as described in refs 6 and 8 (see also Figure S1B).",

In this case, the PCM appears to be a plausible approach as judged from the comparison with QM/MM calculations from ref 16 that provide reaction energies for chlorination versus hydroxylation that are comparable to results from this study.

This would lead to an HO-FeIII-Cl intermediate poised for chlorination due to the shorter distance between the substrate carbon radical and the Cl-ligand relative to the OH-ligand (by \u223c0.5 \u00c5 considering ionic radii). Alter-natively, with the oxo group oriented toward the substrate cavity, H atom abstraction (HAA) would proceed via a \u03c3-attack to produce an HO-FeIII-Cl intermediate poised for hydroxylation due to the favorable distance between C\u2022 and OH-relative to the Cl-(by \u223c0.5 \u00c5 considering ionic radii).6 Indeed, for the \u03c3-trajectory of the C-H bond activation, the Gibbs free energy barriers (\u0394G\u29e7) for the chlorination versus hydroxylation pathways were calculated to be 9.6 versus 3.3 kcal mol-1 (Figure S2). Alter-natively, starting from the product of the \u03c0 pathway of ref 6 (1Thr in Figure 1), chlorination versus hydroxylation from the HO-FeIII-Cl intermediate have essentially the same \u0394G\u29e7 values (5.5 vs 5.7 kcal mol-1 from Figure S2B). However, a small conformational change in the substrate starting from 1Thr gives the structure 2Thr (Figure 1) that is more stable by 2.3 kcal mol-1. 2Thrmaintains the \u03c0 orientation and has a more pronounced asymmetry between the C\u2022---Cl-and C\u2022---OH-distances with Cl-closer to the C\u2022 relative to OH-by \u223c1.3 \u00c5 (considering ionic radii; see Figure S3A). Starting from 2Thr, chlorination was found to be lower in energy than hydroxylation by \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 = 1.5 kcal mol-1 (\u0394\u0394E\u29e7/\u0394\u0394H\u29e7 = 0.4/1.4 kcalmol-1) despite the larger thermodynamic driving force for hydroxylation that is favored by \u0394\u0394G0 = 8.4 kcal mol-1 (\u0394\u0394E0/\u0394\u0394H0 = 12/10 kcal mol-1, at right in Figure 1). The fact that the product of hydroxylation is \u223c10 kcal mol-1 more stable than the product of chlorination is attributed to the stronger C-OH bond (cf., the experimental bond dissociation enthalpy of C-OH vs C-Cl in C2H5OH vs C2H5Cl is 94 vs 84 kcal mol-1). 23 These results are in contrast to the expectation based on the Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle that predicts a lower barrier for a more exergonic (exothermic) reaction.",

Thus, from Figure 2 (and its correlation to the calculations in Figure 1, see caption), \u201cthermo-neutralized\u201d chlorination (starting from 2Thr) is favored over \u201cthermo-neutralized\u201d hydroxylation by \u0394\u0394E\u29e7int = 4.6 kcal mol-1 (\u0394\u0394H\u29e7int/\u0394\u0394G\u29e7int of 5.2/4.8 kcal mol-1). Alternatively, as can be inferred from the plot in Figure 2 (point \u00d7), hydroxylation would be favored over chlorination by \u223c4 kcal mol-1 if chlorination had the same intrinsic barrier as hydroxylation of 20.5 kcal mol-1 (i.e., for \u0394\u0394E\u29e7int = 0 kcal mol-1, hydro-xylation is favored by its thermodynamic contribution). Importantly, this analysis shows that chlorination, in comparison to hydroxylation, is intrinsically more accessible, which more than compensates for its lower exothermicity. Geometric and electronic factors that contribute in SyrB2 to halogenation over hydroxylation selectivity for the native substrate are analyzed below.",
        "In considering the factors controlling selectivity, the geometric structures of 2Thr (Figure 1) and the transition states of chlorina-tion and hydroxylation (labeled TSCl and TSOH in Figure 1) are evaluated first. In 2Thr, the Fe III ion is centered in the square pyramidal (SP) ligand field, with both the Cl-and the OH-equatorial and cis to each other (the z-axis is the open position of the five-coordinate SP FeIII center). The Fe-Cl and Fe-OH vectors are thus mutually perpendicular. As for the substrate location, the C radical is closer to Cl-than to OH-(as indicated earlier), above the Fe-Cl bond vector, perpendicular to the Cl-Fe-OHplane, and trans to the axial histidine ligand. In going from 2Thr to TSCl, there is no significant change in the SP arrangement around the FeIII center. Notably the Fe-Cl bond elongates by only 0.03 \u00c5 (from 2.35 to 2.38 \u00c5), while the C\u2022 shifts from 3.64 to 2.72 \u00c5 with respect to the Cl-, remaining perpendicular to the Cl-Fe-OH plane. Similarly, the FeIII in TSOH maintains its SP ligand field with no change in the Fe-OH bond length relative to 2Thr (1.90 \u00c5), but the C \u2022 shifts from",

        "With respect to electronic structure contributions to the intrinsic barriers, the key FMOs are given in Figure 3. Given the C\u2022 position with respect to the Cl-or OH-ligand at TSCl or TSOH (desribed above), the respective \u03b2-HOMOs are identified as the \u03b2-p(C\u2022) orbital with admixture of \u03b2-d\u03c0* along either the Fe-Cl or the Fe-OH bond (Figure 3A), while the respective \u03b2-LUMOs have the \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-Cl or \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-OH character mixed with the \u03b2-p(C\u2022) (Figure 3A). From Figure 3, there are two dif-ferent orthogonal, electron-accepting Fe-d\u03c0* orbitals, one along the Fe-Cl axis and one along the Fe-OH axis, both perpendicular to the Cl-Fe-OH plane. These are suggested to play key roles in the chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity of SyrB2. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3B, the energies of these \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-Cl and \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-OH orbitals at 2Thr (in the absence of the substrate C\u2022) differ by 4.5 kcal mol-1, with d\u03c0*Fe-Cl lying lower in energy. This energy difference between the two FMOs is similar to the difference between the intrinsic activation energies of chlorination and hydroxylation (i.e., 4.6 kcal mol-1 in favor of chlorination, Figure 2). It is this energy difference between two crucial FMOs that makes chlorination kinetically competitive with hydroxylation; the hydroxylation would otherwise have an activation barrier lower by \u223c4 kcal mol-1 due to the larger exothermicity of the hydroxylated product. Up to this point, the intrinsic selectivity versus the energy splitting between two FMOs is an empirical correlation that is further evaluated in section 3.3 and is related to the mechanism of",

        "3.2. Orientation Dependence of Chlorination versus Hydroxylation. From ref 6, the \u03c3-pathway for H atom abstraction by (SyrB2)FeIV\ue0c8O, with the oxo oriented toward the substrate L-Thr, was proposed to result in substrate hydro-xylation because of the favorable C\u2022---OH distance. This predic-tion was confirmed in section 3.1 (from Table 1, hydroxylation is favored by \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 of -6.3 kcal mol-1 for \u03c3-Thr). In agreement with this, when the non-native substrate L-norvaline (Nva) was evaluated with a \u03c3 orientation for HAA (oxo toward the sub-strate cavity), both the terminal C5 and the adjacent C4 sites in Nva were found to result in a lower Gibbs free-energy barrier for hydroxylation relative to chlorination by \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 = -2.3 kcal mol-1 at C5 and by -0.4 kcal mol-1 at C4 (\u03c3-NvaC5/ C4 in Table 1). These findings clearly demonstrate that the \u03c3-trajectory for HAA performed by the oxo that is oriented toward the substrate leads to the C\u2022/HO-FeIII-Cl inter-mediate, from which hydroxylation is favored. In contrast, from section 3.1, the \u03c0-trajectory for the native L-Thr leads to an intermediate with the OH-oriented away from the substrate radical, favoring chlorination (2Thr in Table 1). Here, we have also evaluated the \u03c0-orientation for the C5 and C4 sites of Nva. For this orientation, while chlorination does mostly occur on the C4 site (\u0394G\u29e7 = 7.0 vs 5.9 kcal mol-1 for hydroxylation vs chlorination; NvaC4 in Table 1), Nva is in fact found to be preferably hydroxylated at C5 (\u0394G\u29e7 = 5.0 vs 5.5 kcal mol-1 for hydroxylation vs chlorination; NvaC5 in Table 1). The energetics of the hydroxylation/chlorination pathways associated with the \u03c0-channel for HAA from Nva are in fact in better agreement with the experimental data than those associated with the \u03c3-channel: experimentally, the C5 site is more hydroxylated (95% of the hydroxylated product),9 while the C4 site is more chlorinated (65%).9 Another non-native substrate, L-amino-butyric acid that is experimentally known to be hydroxylated/ chlorinated in a ratio of 69:31%,9 was also calculated. The \u03c0-trajectory has essentially equivalent barriers for hydroxylation and chlorination, while the \u03c3-channel leads to hydroxyla-tion (Aba vs \u03c3-Aba in Table 1). Thus, the \u03c0-channel for HAA, which is a required prerequisite for the less thermodynamically favorable chlorination (as analyzed in section 3.1), can also allow hydroxylation. Importantly, such a change in selectivity with the \u03c0-orientation does not reflect either a difference in the thermo-dynamics of hydroxylation versus chlorination (\u0394\u0394G0), as these are approximately the same for all of the systems studied (see Figure S2), or a difference in ligand field, as this remains the same over the series (all having five-coordinate square-pyramidal FeIII-hydroxy centers).",
        "An effect that tunes the reaction selectivity in these \u03c0-oriented systems enabling either chlorination or hydroxylation is the orientation of the substrate C\u2022 with respect to the Cl-Fe-OH plane. Its orientation, defined by the dihedral angle \u03b1 between the plane containing C\u2022---Cl vector and the Cl-Fe-OH plane, varies for the different C\u2022/HO-FeIII-Cl \u03c0-oriented intermedi-ates from 72\u00b0 (2Thr) through 69\u00b0 (NvaC4), 56\u00b0 (Aba), and 51\u00b0 (1Thr) to 41\u00b0 (NvaC5). For chlorination (from the calculations given in Figure S2), the C\u2022 at TSCl maintains roughly the same orientation as in the associated intermediate (\u03b1 = 79\u00b0, 62\u00b0, 51\u00b0, 50\u00b0, and 44\u00b0). Alternatively, for hydroxylation, \u03b1 is very similar at all of the TSOH structures (falling in the range between 42\u00b0 and 36\u00b0). Thus, the orientation dependence of \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 is correlated with the angle \u03b1 (essentially the same in the reactant and the TSCl) and reflects the amount the intermediate has to distort to reach the TSOH structure (the larger is the distortion, the more positive is \u0394\u0394G\u29e7). From the \u0394\u0394G\u29e7 versus \u03b1 plot in Figure 4A,",
        "chlorination (green arrow) exhibits the largest preference for the most perpendicular orientation of the C\u2022---Cl vector relative to the Cl-Fe-OH plane (72\u00b0 at 2Thr), whereas hydroxylation is mostly preferred in the NvaC5 system, which has the most parallel orientation of C\u2022---Cl vector to the Cl-Fe-OH plane at the intermediate (44\u00b0). For the Aba system that has an inter-mediate orientation between those in NvaC5 and 2Thr (56\u00b0 in Figure 4A), chlorination and hydroxylation have comparable \u0394G\u29e7 values. The fact that these correlations reflect the amount of reactant\u2192 TSOH distortion is further supported by the analyses in Figure 4B. This gives the distortion energy (\u0394Edistortion) for hydroxylation (red) and chlorination (green), which is defined as",

For hydroxylation, the\u0394Edistortion increases with \u03b1, while for chlorination it remains approximately the same (the green line). Thus, the differential distortion energy \u0394\u0394Edistortion (black line in Figure 4B) exhibits a slope similar to that of\u0394Edistortion for hydroxylation (red line in Figure 4B), with \u0394\u0394Edistortion having a trend similar to that of \u0394\u0394G\u29e7, that is, both favoring hydro-xylation in the NvaC5 system and chlorination in 2Thr and NvaC4.",
        "The difference in distortion energy required for reaching TSOH versus TSCl is linked to a difference in how much the d\u03c0*FeCl versus d\u03c0*FeOH FMO distorts away from its perpendicular orientation relative to the HO-Fe-Cl plane upon the overlap with the substrate radical. In Figure 5, the two FMOs, d\u03c0*FeCl and d\u03c0*FeOH (the first and third columns), are displayed at the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate geometries in the presence of different substrates (each row for one substrate). Following the chlorination pathway (going from the first to second column), the d\u03c0*FeCl \u03c0-overlaps with the substrate p orbital (the \u03b2-HOMO in the second column). From the comparison of all of the \u03b2-HOMOs in the second column of Figure 5, the deviation of the p orbital from its perpendicular orientation relative to the HO-Fe-Cl plane increases with the decrease in the angle \u03b1. Consequently, the orientation of d\u03c0*FeCl follows the rotation of the C\u2022 along the Fe-Cl bond to maximize its overlap with the p(C\u2022) orbital. This adaptability in the orientation of d\u03c0*FeCl is attributed to the p(C\u2022)-mediated orbital mixing between d\u03c0*yz (from Figure 3) and the higher-energy d\u03c0*xy (axes defined in Figure 3B) that increases with the decrease in \u03b1 (Table S2). For hydroxylation, where the d\u03c0*FeOH \u03c0-overlaps with the substrate p orbital at TSOH, the d\u03c0*FeOH is also rotated to achieve good overlap with the substrate p(C\u2022) orbital (from the third to fourth column in Figure 5). However, the d\u03c0*FeOH rotation is limited and approximately the same for all systems (see the \u03b2-HOMOs in the fourth column of Figure 5). This is rationalized by the limited flexibility in the OH ligand vector orientation, which is anchored by an H-bond to the neighboring monodentate carboxylate group and one from the nearby (crystallographic) water molecule (Table S3). This results in a similar angle \u03b1 for all calculated TSOH\u2019s, and the change in selectivity is therefore mostly given by how much the intermediate has to distort to reach TSOH.",

In this section, this correlation is elaborated using small structural",

        "For these structures, the intrinsic barriers for chlorination versus halogenation (fluorination to iodination) were calculated as described in Figure S6 with a methyl radical positioned perpen-dicular to the transferring atom and correlated with the energy splitting of the d\u03c0*Fe-Cl/d\u03c0*Fe-X FMOs. This correlation is given in Figure 6. For I, the \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-I orbital is \u223c5 kcal mol-1 lower in energy than \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-Cl (at 0 kcal mol -1 on the abscisa), which directly correlates with the low intrinsic barrier for iodination versus chlorination, favoring iodination by \u223c4 kcal mol-1. In contrast, the \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-F orbital in 1-F is\u223c4 kcal mol-1 higher in energy than \u03b2-d\u03c0*Fe-Cl and has the highest intrinsic barrier (for fluorination) as compared to chlorination by \u223c5 kcal mol-1.",
        "Thus, the \u0394FMO (=E[d\u03c0*xz,Fe-X] -E[d\u03c0*yz,Fe-Cl]) correlates with intrinsic reactivity, and we can now consider the ligand field (LF) factors that influence \u0394FMO for a series of FeIIICl/X (=OH, F, Cl, Br, I) complexes. First, LF geometries were varied as shown in Figure S7, where calculations of the FMO energy splitting for octahedral (O) versus square-pyramidal (SP) versus trigonal-bipyramidal (TBP) structures show that there is no significant dependence on the structure (\u0394FMO = 4.2, 3.1, 4.1 kcal mol-1 for O vs SP vs TBP). Next, for a group of five-coordinate square-pyramidal structures [(NH3)3(X)Fe IIICl with X = OH-, F-, Cl-, Br-, and I-], we systematically varied the pair of Cl-/X-cis-equatorial ligands as given in Figure 7. Within this series, the FMO energy splitting varies in a manner similar to that in Figure 6. This allows evaluation of the relative contributions of \u03c0",

        "where IX is the ionization potential of X, cX 2 is defined above, and E\u03c0,Fe-Cl is the \u03c0-donation contribution to the destabilization energy of the d\u03c0*Fe-Cl that is assumed to be positive for \u03c0-donation into a d\u03c0* orbital. Importantly, for a positive value of E\u03c0,Fe-Cl (>\u223c2 kcal mol-1), the E\u03c0,Fe-I and E\u03c0,Fe-Br are always larger than the E\u03c0,Fe-Cl, while the opposite is true for the E\u03c0,Fe-F and E\u03c0,Fe-OH (see Figure S8). However, this is not the trend reflected in \u0394FMO, where d\u03c0*Fe-I and d\u03c0*Fe-Br are lower in energy than d\u03c0*Fe-Cl, while d\u03c0*Fe-OH and d\u03c0*Fe-F are higher (Figure 7). Considering the fact that X-and Cl-ligands in the complexes in Figure 7 are both trans to the \u03c3-donating ligand NH3, we can also exclude a trans effect contribution to\u0394FMO. The trend in \u0394FMO does however correlate with differences in the strength of the ligand field. This can be estimated from the relative partial Mulliken charges of the X-versus Cl-ligand, as given by the qX/qCl quantity at the bottom row of Figure 7. These reflect the fact that lower electron donation leads to more negative charge on the ligand. From Figure 7, while OH-is a weaker \u03c0-donor than Cl-, it is associated with a stronger LF, which leads to a higher-energy d\u03c0*Fe-OH as compared to the d\u03c0*Fe-Cl orbital.",
        "3.4. Possible Mechanisms of Chlorination and Hydrox-ylation. We first consider a \u201crebound\u201d mechanism. Within this process, the FeIII-Cl (FeIII-OH) bond would undergo homo-lytic cleavage, producing the Cl\u2022 (OH\u2022) moiety that recombines with the substrate C\u2022. Figure 8 presents thermodynamic cycles for the chlorination and hydroxylation reactions in Figure S6A that include the two sequential steps, homolysis and recombi-nation. From a comparison of the two cycles, homolysis of the FeIII-Cl bond is 12 kcal mol-1 less favorable than homolytic cleavage of the FeIII-OH bond (cf., \u0394E1 values in Figure 8A and B), which qualitatively parallels the experimental (and calculated) ionization potentials of Cl-and OH-(IP[Cl-\u2192 Cl\u2022)] = 3.623 (3.3) eV; IP[OH-\u2192 OH\u2022)] = 1.823 (1.2) eV). Also, the recombination of the radicals (\u0394E2 in Figure 8) is calculated to favor hydroxylation by \u223c11 kcal mol-1 (cf., the experimental bond dissociation energy of CH3-Cl vs CH3-OH is 83 vs 92 kcal mol-1).23 From these numbers, chlorination would not compete with hydroxylation.",
        "Another possible mechanism would correspond to a process in which the FeIII-Cl (FeIII-OH) bond spin polarizes to FeII-Cl\u2022 (FeII-OH\u2022) upon the attack of the substrate. Figure 9A presents the reaction coordinate for chlorination from 2Thr from right to left that includes the DFT potential energy surface (PES) of the electronic ground state (green curve). The analogous PES for hydroxylation is shown in Figure 9B (red curve). Constrained density functional theory (cDFT) allows localization of the spin density along the reaction coordinate. Thus, cDFT is suitable for the evaluation of the energy required for FeIII-X\u2192 FeII-X\u2022 spin polarization along the reaction coordinate in Figure 9. Within the cDFT approach, an FeII-X\u2022 state can be optimized by con-straining one unpaired \u03b1 electron on X (=Cl or OH), four unpaired \u03b1 electrons on Fe, and one unpaired \u03b2 electron on the substrate. This constraint, maintained along the chlorination and hydroxylation reaction coordinates, allows for construction of \u201cdiabatic\u201d PESs of the spin-polarized FeII-Cl\u2022 and FeII-OH\u2022 states (mangenta curves in Figure 9A and B). From valence bond theory, a diabatic state preserves its character with a change in a molecular geometry. This differs from an adiabatic state that can be considered as a linear combination of diabatic states with weights that change with molecular geometry. Thus, the adiabatic ground-state PES (reaction barrier in green and red in Figure 9A and B) should result from a strong configuration",

        "4. DISCUSSION Considering a \u03c3-trajectory for the H atom abstraction reaction (with the oxo oriented toward the substrate cavity), hydrox-ylation is found to be favored over chlorination for all substrates investigated in this study (section 3.2; see also Scheme 2A).",
        "Thus, this \u03c3-trajectory cannot be operative in SyrB2 in the presence of the native substrate L-Thr that is predominantly chlorinated. Instead, as was already reported in refs 6 and 8, the HAA pathway with the L-Thr is suggested to follow the \u03c0-trajectory (with the oxo oriented perpendicular to the substrate cavity). Following the \u03c0-trajectory for HAA in SyrB2 with different substrates, the reaction barrier of chlorination is calcu-lated to be comparable (and in some cases favored) to that of the more thermodynamically favored hydroxylation (Scheme 2A). This is associated with a higher intrinsic reactivity toward chlorination due to the lower intrinsic activation barrier (by 4-5 kcal mol-1) as determined by a Marcus theory analysis (section 3.1). Thus, the intrinsic preference for chlorination compensates the thermodynamic propensity for hydroxylation. The difference between intrinsic activation barriers for the \u201cthermo-neutralized\u201d chlorination and hydroxylation reactions correlates to the energy difference between two key frontier molecular orbitals (sections 3.1 and 3.3). One of these FMOs, which results from the antibonding \u03c0-interaction along the Fe-Cl bond axis (d\u03c0*Fe-Cl), is active in chlorination and is \u223c4-5 kcalmol-1 lower in energy than the FMOactive in hydroxylation, arising from the analogous antibonding interaction along the Fe-OH bond axis (d\u03c0*Fe-OH). These two FMOs are depicted in Figure 3. The FMO energy splitting \u0394FMO",
        "agreement with the experimental observations from ref 9. The \u03c0-trajectory for H atom abstraction as defined in refs 6 and 8 was calculated to lead to the S = 2 five-coordinate HO-FeIII-Cl intermediate with the C\u2022 substrate, \u03c0-oriented relative to both the Cl-and the OH-ligands. Starting from this ferric inter-mediate, hydroxylation is thermodynamically favored, but chlorination is intrinsically more reactive. A higher intrinsic chlorination reactivity derives from the energy splitting between two key redox-active d\u03c0* FMOs: the lower is the FMO energy for chlorination relative to that for hydroxylation, the higher is the intrinsic reactivity for chlorination. The orbital splitting arises from the differential ligand-field effect of Cl-versus OH-on the Fe d\u03c0* orbitals. This factor makes chlorination effectively com-petitive with hydroxylation. Chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity is then determined by the orientation of the substrate C\u2022 with respect to the HO-Fe-Cl plane that is related to the differential overlap of the substrate p orbital with two d\u03c0* FMOs. The differential contribution of the FMOs to chlorination versus hydroxylation selectivity in SyrB2 is related to a reaction mech-anism that employs two asynchronous transfers: electron transfer from the substrate radical to the iron center followed by late ligand (Cl-or OH-) transfer to the substrate.",

(20) Frequency calculations were performed on top of the optimized cluster models of SyrB2 that include seven frozen atoms (shown in Figure S1A). Within this approach, 21 degrees of freedom associated with the frozen atoms are projected out from the Hessian. This ensures that all structures (belonging to one catalytic cycle) have the same number of vibrational frequencies, among which there is no or one imaginary frequency depending on whether a minimum or transition",
