One of the main roles of SAM is the methylation of nucleic acids, proteins and metabolites. Methylation often imparts regulatory control to DNA and proteins, and leads to an increase in the activity of specialized metabolites such as those developed as pharmaceuticals. There has been increased interest in using SAM analogs in methyltransferase-catalyzed modification of biomolecules. However, SAM and its analogs are expensive and unstable, degrading rapidly under physiological conditions. Thus, the availability of methods to prepare SAM in situ are desirable. In addition, synthetic methods to generate SAM analogs suffer from low yields and poor diastereoselectivity. The chlorinase SalL from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica catalyzes the reversible, nucleophilic attack of chloride at the C5\u2032 ribosyl carbon of SAM leading to the formation of 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (ClDA) with concomitant displacement of L-methionine. It has been demonstrated that the in vitro equilibrium of the SalL-catalyzed reaction favors the synthesis of SAM. In this chapter, we describe methods for the preparation of SalL, and the chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM and SAM analogs from ClDA and L-methionine congeners using SalL. In addition, we describe procedures for the in situ chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM coupled to DNA, peptide and metabolite methylation, and to the incorporation of isotopes into alkylated products.Keywords S-adenosylmethionine (SAM); chlorodeoxyadenosine synthase; chlorinase; methylation; isotope incorporation; chemoenzymatic1.

Remarkably, SAM has also recently been shown to serve as cofactor in coordinating pericyclic reactions via electrostatic catalysis (Ohashi, Liu, Hai, Chen, Tang, Yang, et al., 2017). Another role for SAM is to serve as a substrate in reactions catalyzed by SAM-dependent halogenases of the 5\u2032-halo-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine synthase class (Dong, Huang, Deng, Schaffrath, Spencer, O\u2019Hagan & Naismith, 2004; Eust\u00e1quio, Pojer, Noel & Moore, 2008; Agarwal, Miles, Winter, Eust\u00e1quio, El Gamal & Moore, 2017).Halogenated compounds are pervasive across all domains of life. Over 5,000 organohalogens are known. Organochlorines and organobromines are the most abundant with >2,000 known examples of each, whereas organoiodines are more scarce (<200) and organofluorines are very rare with only five rigorously identified compounds (Gribble, 2012; Chan & O\u2019Hagan, 2012, and Wang, Zhou, Fredimoses, Liao & Liu, 2014). Halogenating enzymes employ various mechanistic strategies depending on the properties of the halogen atom and the reactivity of the organic substrate. Most halogenases activate chloride, bromide and iodide via oxidation by utilizing cofactors such as heme-iron, vanadium, flavin and Fe(II)/\u03b1-ketoglutarate (Agarwal et al., 2017). For fluoride, on the other hand, which evades oxidation due to its extreme electronegativity, an orthogonal strategy has been described that uses SAM as co-substrate in an SN2-type, nucleophilic substitution reaction (Figure 1). The only fluorinase described thus far (FlA) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of fluoroacetate and fluorothreonine in the soil bacterium Streptomyces cattleya in which fluoride attacks the C5\u2032 electrophilic carbon of SAM, displacing L-methionine and generating 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (Dong et al., 2004).Four years after the structural characterization of the fluorinase, the chlorinase SalL was reported from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008). SalL is analogous to fluorinase and the only other characterized SAM-dependent halogenase of the 5\u2032-halo-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (XDA) synthase class (Figure 1). SalL catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008 and 2009; Feling, Buchanan, Mincer, Kauffman, Jensen & Fenical, 2003). Both FlA and SalL can also catalyze the reverse reaction, i.e. synthesis of SAM from XDA. For FlA, the in vitro equilibrium lies in favor of FDA by a factor of three (Dong et al., 2004). That the forward reaction is favored by FlA is unsurprising given that the C-F bond is the strongest bond in organic chemistry. For chlorinase SalL, on the other hand, synthesis of SAM from ClDA and L-met is favored, with the relative enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) for the reverse reaction (SAM synthesis) being several orders of magnitude higher than the forward halogenation reaction (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008). The fluorinase was also reported to favor the reverse reaction in vitro when using chloride as the halide (Deng, Cobb, McEwan, McGlinchey, Naismith, O\u2019Hagan et al., 2006).As a versatile methyl donor to biomolecules, there has been considerable interest in exploring the synthesis of SAM analogs of chemical and biological utility. For instance, non-natural SAM analogs could be used to modify cellular targets such as DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites. Moreover, SAM itself is an expensive and unstable cofactor, Davis et al.Page 2Methods Enzymol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 July 12.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript degrading rapidly under physiological or alkaline conditions. Thus, the availability of methods to prepare SAM in situ are desirable.Traditionally, SAM analogs have been chemically synthesized from S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. However, this synthesis suffers from low yields and lack of diastereoselectivity (Dalhoff, Lukinavicius, Klimasauskas & Weinhold, 2006). Furthermore, SAM synthesis is challenging due to its inherent lability and tendency to racemize (Hoffman, 1986). Chemoenzymatic synthesis using chlorinase SalL and ClDA offers an alternative to chemical synthesis. In addition to being stable and commercially available, ClDA can also be synthesized economically from adenosine and SOCl2 (Sinhababu, Bartel, Pochopin & Borchardt 1985). Chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM and analogs in situ could also be coupled with downstream applications such as methylation or alkylation by methyltransferases. This strategy can also be used for the facile incorporation of isotopes into alkylated products.We have demonstrated the use of SalL for the diastereoselective synthesis of SAM and SAM congeners from ClDA and L-met analogs (See section 3). We have also coupled the SalL-catalyzed production of SAM with DNA and with metabolite methylation (Lipson, Thomsen, Moore, Clausen, La Clair & Burkart 2013). Importantly, we have demonstrated that in situ generated SAM analogs were recognized by rat protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (rPRMT1) which alkylated its peptide substrate (Thomsen, Vogensen, Buchardt, Burkart, & Clausen 2013).In this chapter, we describe procedures for the preparation and assay of SalL, the SalL-mediated chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM analogs from ClDA and L-met congeners, and the in situ chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM coupled to DNA, peptide and metabolite methylation, and to the incorporation of isotopes into alkylated products.2. Preparation and Assay of Chlorinase SalL2.1 Purification of Recombinant SalL from Escherichia coliRecombinant SalL containing a N-terminal His8 tag was obtained by gene expression in and protein purification from E. coli BL21(DE3) (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008).2.1.1 Cloning of the salL Gene into an Expression Vector\u2014The salL gene can be amplified by PCR using total genomic DNA isolated from S. tropica CNB-440 as a template and appropriate primers. The following are suggested primers that were used to clone salL into pHIS8 (Jez, Ferrer, Bowman, Dixon & Noel, 2000) by restriction/ligation, yielding plasmid pAEM7 (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008):for: 5\u2019-CGTGGTTCCCATGGCATGCAGCACAATCTCATTGC-3\u2019 (NcoI site underlined) rev: 5\u2019-GCTCGAATTCAAGCTTGTCAGCTACCCGAGCACCG-3\u2019 (HindIII site underlined) The primers were designed to ensure that the ATG (Met start codon, bold) was in-frame with the His8 tag. The priming sites are in italics. Bases upstream of the restriction sites are Davis et al.Page 3Methods Enzymol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 July 12.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript random sequences to facilitate cutting of the PCR product with the respective restriction enzyme. salL was amplified by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and using 5% DMSO (v/v) and annealing temperature of 58 \u00b0C. Alternative, proofreading DNA polymerases include Q5\u00ae High Fidelity polymerase and Phusion\u00ae High Fidelity polymerase (New England Biolabs). The expected size of the PCR product when using primers above is 888 bp. Alternatively, synthetic DNA can be ordered from GenScript. The accession code for the salL gene (Strop_1026) of S. tropica CNB-440 is NC_009380.1 (position 1,162,700 to 1,163,551, complement). If using the primers above, digest the PCR product with NcoI and HindIII and ligate it into the same sites of pHIS8 to yield the pHIS8-salL expression vector (pAEM7). While the PCR product can be digested and cloned directly into pHIS8, we subcloned the PCR product into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) by following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The insert of the obtained plasmid (pAEM5) was sequenced and confirmed to contain no mistakes. Following digestion of pAEM5 with HindIII, NcoI and DraI (DraI cuts only the vector backbone), and isopropanol precipitation, the HindIII-NcoI salL fragment (868 bp) was cloned into the same sites of pHIS8. pHIS8 contains an N-terminal, 8xHis tag that will facilitate protein purification. Note that the pAEM7 salL expression plasmid used here contains native DNA from S. tropica rather than DNA which is codon-optimized for expression in E. coli.2.1.2 Expression of salL in E. coli BL21(DE3) and Purification of Recombinant SalL Enzyme2.1.2.1 Materials\u2022 Competent E. coli BL-21 (DE3) cells (e.g. Novagen)\u2022 salL expression vector (pAEM7)\u2022 Luria-Bertani (LB) agar (Becton Dickinson)\u2022 LB broth (Becton Dickinson)\u2022 Terrific Broth (TB) medium (Becton Dickinson)\u2022 Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen)\u2022 Lysis buffer: 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 20 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (v/v) Tween-20, 1 mg/mL lysozyme\u2022 Wash buffer: 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 20 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol\u2022 Elution buffer: 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 20 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol\u2022 Storage buffer: 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol\u2022 Disposable polypropylene column (e.g. from Qiagen)\u2022 Disposable PD-10 desalting columns (Sephadex G-25, GE Healthcare)Davis et al.Page 4Methods Enzymol.

Competent E. coli BL-21 (DE3) cells are commercially available (e.g. Novagen, cat. No. 69450\u20133). Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to introduce the salL-containing expression vector into E.coli BL-21 (DE3) by chemical transformation. Plate the transformation reaction on LB agar containing 50 mg/L kanamycin (pHIS8 contains a kanamycin-resistance gene) and incubate the plates overnight at 37 \u00b0C.2. Inoculate a single colony onto 50 mL LB containing 50 mg/L kanamycin (use a 250-mL flask) and incubate the flask overnight at 37 \u00b0C, 200 rpm.3. Prepare cryo stocks for long-term storage by mixing the E. coli BL21(DE3) culture containing the salL plasmid 1:1 with sterile glycerol 40%, giving a final glycerol concentration of 20%. Store cryo stocks at -80 \u00b0C.4. Use the overnight LB culture to inoculate 1 L of TB media containing 50 mg/L kanamycin so that the starting A600 = 0.1 (10 to 20 mL of the overnight E. coli seed culture are expected to be necessary). Incubate the flask at 25 \u00b0C, 225 rpm until A600 = 0.8. Once an A600 of 0.8 is reached, induce cells with 0.25 mM IPTG (final concentration) and incubate overnight at 20 \u00b0C, 225 rpm. A 2.8-L Fernbach flask is recommended for cultivation of 1-L cultures.5. Harvest cells by centrifugation (e.g. 15 min at 5,000 \u00d7 g) and resuspend the cell pellet in ~20 mL of cold lysis buffer. Incubate on ice for 30 min.6. Note: take care to keep the preparation cold by cooling centrifuges, buffers, and keeping the sample on ice.7. Lyse cells by sonication on ice (e.g. 2 sec on, 2 sec off for 3 min total). Alternatively, a French press can be used for cell lysis.8. Centrifuge the lysate at high speed (> 10,000 \u00d7 g) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.9. The clear lysate is then purified using Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) and a modified batch purification method as briefly described below (refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions \u201cThe QIAexpressionist\u201d for more details).10. Transfer the clear lysate to a clean, autoclaved beaker on ice, and add 5 mL Ni2+-NTA to the clear lysate. Mix gently using a magnetic stirrer for 1 hour. Alternatively, use a rotary shaker for mixing the sample contained in a conical tube. 11. If using a beaker for mixing, transfer the lysate / Ni-NTA suspension to a conical tube and centrifuge at 3,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to collect the Ni-NTA resin.12. Discard the supernatant and wash the resin twice with 25 mL wash buffer each as following. Add 25 mL wash buffer to the Ni-NTA pellet, resuspend gently, and centrifuge at 3,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Discard supernatant and repeat.Davis et al.Page 5Methods Enzymol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 July 12.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript 13. After the last wash, resuspend the Ni-NTA pellet in ~5 mL wash buffer and transfer the resin to an empty polypropylene column with the bottom outlet capped. Remove bottom cap and discard flow-through. Wash once with 25 mL cold wash buffer. Discard flow through.14. Elute the His8-tagged SalL with 2\u00d7 5 mL elution buffer.15. Assess the quality of the protein preparation using SDS-PAGE (e.g. 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel with MOPS running buffer, ThermoFisher). The expected size of the His8-tagged protein is 32.4 kDa (Figure 2).16. The expected yield is > 60 mg recombinant, soluble SalL per liter of culture. Protein yield can be calculated using the Bradford assay (Bradford 1976).17. Desalting can be performed using PD-10 columns (Sephadex G-25): cut the bottom tip off the column and let the storage liquid flow (discard); equilibrate the column with 25 mL storage buffer; load sample in a total volume of 2.5 mL per PD-10 column; discard the flow through; elute with 3.5 mL storage buffer. Alternatively, dialysis can be used for desalting.2.2 SalL Activity AssayThe reaction catalyzed by chlorinase SalL is reversible. Chloride, bromide and iodide are accepted as the halide co-substrates in the reaction with SAM (forward reaction) to yield 5\u2032-halo-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (XDA). Kinetic studies demonstrated that the reverse reaction (formation of SAM from XDA and L-met) is favored in vitro, with the relative enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) of the reverse reaction being orders of magnitude higher than the forward reaction (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008). The activity of recombinant SalL can be investigated by a HPLC-based method as described below.2.2.1 Reagents\u2022 S-adenosyl-L-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich)\u2022 KCl (analytical grade)\u2022 L-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich)\u2022 5\u2032-Chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (Sigma-Aldrich)\u2022 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.9\u2022 Recombinant SalL (section 2.1)2.2.2 Instrumentation and Solvents\u2022 Agilent HPLC 1200\u2022 C18 column (250 \u00d7 4.60 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size)\u2022 Mobile phase A: 95% 50 mM KH2PO4; 5% acetonitrile\u2022 Mobile phase B: 80% 50 mM KH2PO4; 20% acetonitrile\u2022 Note: 50 mM KH2PO4 gives pH ~ 4.5; there is no need to adjust the pH.Davis et al.Page 6Methods Enzymol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 July 12.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript 2.2.3 Procedure1. In order to test if your SalL preparation is active, set up two different reactions by incubating SalL (400 nM) withi. SAM (0.5 mM) and KCl (400 mM)ii. L-methionine (10 mM) and ClDA (0.5 mM)in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.9) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. In addition, set up following controls: reactions with inactivated enzyme (the enzyme is first boiled for 5 min and then, the reagents are added) and boiled enzyme only (the enzyme is boiled for 5 min in buffer).2. Boil the reaction mixture for 2 min at 95 \u00b0C and centrifuge for 30 min, 10,000 \u00d7 g to remove precipitated protein. 10 \u00b5l of clear supernatant is then analyzed by HPLC using a C18 column (250 \u00d7 4.60 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size) and 1 mL/min flow rate. After equilibrating the system for at least 15 min using 100 % mobile phase A, run following gradient: 100% A for 1 min, 0 to 100% B for 29 min, 100% to 0% B over 5 min, 100% A for 5 min. Inject also SAM and ClDA standards for comparison. The retention times obtained under the conditions described were ClDA (16.4 min) and SAM (18.1 min).3. Notes: \u2022 SAM is unstable and SAM solutions should be freshly prepared\u2022 Recombinant SalL purified from E. coli co-purifies with adenosine and ClDA. Thus, the boiled enzyme negative control may have a small peak for ClDA.3. CHEMOENZYMATIC SYNTHESIS OF SAM ANALOGS3.1 Overview of Chemoenzymatic Methods to Prepare SAM and SAM AnalogsSAM is biosynthesized by methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT) from methionine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Cantoni, 1975; Figure 3). SAM is an essential cofactor for SAM-dependent methyltransferases to methylate various substrates including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules (Martin & McMillan 2002; Lin, 2011; Struck, Thompson, Wong & Micklefield, 2012; Bauerle, Schwalm, & Booker, 2015). While transmethylation produces small and modest chemical changes, these drastically affect molecular recognition of substrates by cellular targets to control processes such as epigenetic regulation of protein expression, neurotransmission, and natural products biosynthesis. The prevalence of SAM in cellular processes has inspired the development of analogs as chemical reporters for nucleic acid (Dalhoff Lukinavicius, Klimasauskas & Weinhold, 2006a; Dalhoff et al., 2006b; Lukinavicius, Lapiene, Stasevskij, Dalhoff, Weinhold & Klimasauskas 2007; Motorin, Burhenne, Teimer, Koynov, Willnow, Weinhold, et al., 2011; Vranken, Fin, Tufar, Hofkens, Burkart & Tor, 2016), protein (Peters, Willnow, Duisken, Kleine, Macherey, Duncan et al., 2010; Wang, Zheng, Yu, Deng & Luo, 2011; Islam, Zheng, Yu, Deng & Luo, 2011; Islam, Bothwell, Chen, Sengelaub, Wang, Deng & Luo, 2011; Wang, Islam, Liu, Zheng, Tang, Lailler et al., 2013; Wang & Luo, 2013; Islam, Chen, Wu, Davis et al.Page 7Methods Enzymol.

The preparation of SAM and its analogs is especially challenging due to inherent lability, tendency to racemize under experimental conditions, and rapid degradation at physiological pH (Hoffman, 1986). Chemical synthesis of SAM and SAM derivatives involves nucleophilic substitution between S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH or AdoCy) and an alkyl halide to produce a mixture of two sulfonium diastereomers, usually in variable yields (de la Haba, Jamieson, Mudd & Richards, 1959; Dalhoff et al., 2006; Stecher et al., 2009). The S,S diastereomer serves as the methyl donor, while the S,R diastereomer inhibits the methyltransferase (Borchardt & Wu, 1976; Khani-Oskouee, Jones, & Woodard, 1984). Additionally, analogs of SAM where sulfur is replaced with selenium are more reactive methyl donors due to the longer, weaker Se-C bonds and do not racemize (Iwig & Booker, 2004). Notably, select Se-adenosyl-L-selenomethionines (SeAM), i.e. propargyl SeAM, are more stable than their SAM analogs (Bothwell, Islam, Chen, Zheng, Blum, Deng et al., 2012; Bothwell & Luo, 2014). Overall, these early synthetic efforts ignited investigations in which non-natural SAM analogs could be used by endogenous methyltransferases to modify and profile various cellular targets.To complement chemical synthesis of SAM analogs, we pioneered chemoenzymatic methods to expand the range of SAM analogs available for labeling methyltransferase substrates (Lipson et al., 2013; Thomsen et al., 2013; Vranken et al., 2016). We employed two homologous halogenases, SalL and FlA, to produce SAM and SAM analogs. As discussed earlier, SalL catalyzes the reaction of SAM with chloride to produce 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (ClDA) and L-methionine via nucleophilic attack in Salinispora tropica (Figure 1). Similarly, Streptomyces cattleya uses fluorinase FlA to react fluoride with SAM to afford 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (FDA) and L-methionine. Based on Le Chatelier\u2019s Principle, we hypothesized that under low salt concentrations and excess L-methionine, these halogenases could catalyze the biologically reversed reaction to produce SAM in situ (Figure 3) from easily prepared ClDA. Indeed, we observed SAM production by both SalL and FlA in various buffers, including Tris, HEPES, and phosphate buffers at pH 7\u20138, although SalL produced SAM in substantially higher yields than FlA. Furthermore, we generated a W190A point mutant of SalL that could accommodate larger alkyl substrates (Thomsen et al., 2013). Both wild type (WT) and mutant SalL generated alkyl, allylic, and benzylic SAM analogs, although the WT was most effective at generating small SAM analogs (methyl, ethyl), whereas both the WT and W190A mutant were equally effective at producing larger SAM analogs (propyl, butyl, allyl, and benzyl). Importantly, we demonstrated that our in situ generated SAM congeners were recognized by nucleic acid, peptide, and small molecule methyltransferases, and alkylated their respective substrates (Thomsen et al., 2013).Davis et al.Page 8Methods Enzymol.

In all assays, the addition of L-methionine or analog was 10% of the total reaction volume, resulting in a final pH of 7.4.3. Quench reactions at various time points (0\u20135 hours) by the addition of equal volumes of 400 mM sodium formate. Store quenched aliquots at 4 \u2070C until HPLC analysis.4.

Verify the identity of ClDA and SAM by collecting 0.1 mL fractions from the HPLC and analyze by LC-MS. Table 1 provides a summary of LC-MS data for select SAM analogs. See Thomsen, et al. 2013 for representative LC-MS traces and chromatograms.3.3 In situ Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of SAM Coupled to DNA Methylation by HhaIHhaI is a DNA methyltransferase that methylates cytosine at C5 (Sankpal & Rao, 2002).

HhaI was inactive in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.9, however, the activity of SalL was reduced by 30% in HhaI buffer. Thus, coupled assays were conducted in HhaI buffer.2.

Wright, McMaster University). The cells were cultured at 37 \u2070C to an OD600 of 0.6. The cells were cooled to 0 \u2070C on ice, induced with 100 \u00b5M isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and grown for 20 h at 16 \u2070C. Cells were harvested via centrifugation at 2,000 \u00d7 g, 30 min, 4 \u2070C and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.5) and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4150 \u00d7 g, 1.5 h, 4 \u2070C. His6-MtfA was purified using 2 mL Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 40 mL of buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5), followed by 40 mL of buffer B (50 mM HEPES, 400 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The protein was eluted with buffer C (50 mM HEPES, 400 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5). We obtained around 50 mg of MtfA per L of cell culture.Eluted proteins were visualized with 12% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Imidazole was removed using spin concentration into 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT, pH 7.5. Pure protein was stored at -20 \u2070C in 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM DTT, pH 7.5 containing 50% glycerol. The protein is stable as a glycerol stock at -20 \u2070C.3.4.5 Procedure1. Equilibrate a 50 \u00b5L mixture of 20 mM ClDA, 50 mM L-methionine, and 1.4 \u00b5M SalL in 32 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.9 at 37 \u2070C.2. After 1\u20133 h, add 250 \u00b5L of a solution containing: 1 mM teicoplanin, 1 mg/mL BSA, and 54 \u00b5M MtfA in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3.3. Monitor the methylation of teicoplanin by removing aliquots at various times and analyzing by LC-MS using a C18 column (3 \u00b5m, 2.1\u00d7150 mm, Atlantis) and an isocratic mixture of 3:1 H2O/CH3CN (v/v) with 0.1% formic acid. Under these conditions, the retention times of teicoplanin and N-methyl-teicoplanin were 9 min and 9.5 min, respectively.3.5 In situ Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 13C-labeled SAM Coupled with Isotope Incorporation into Teicoplanin via Methylation by MtfAWe envisioned SalL-mediated in situ chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM as a compelling and facile way to incorporate isotopes into biomolecules. Here we describe the use of this technology to incorporate 13C into teicoplanin for sensitive NMR identification (Lipson et al., 2013).3.5.1 Reagents\u2022 d6-DMSO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Item No. DLM-10\u201310)\u2022 [Methyl-13C]-L-methionine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Item No. CLM-206-PK) \u2022 Teicoplanin (TargetMol)Davis et al.Page 12Methods Enzymol.

Prepare 800 \u00b5L of a mixture of 350 nM SalL and 350 nM MtfA in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5.2. Prepare 200 \u00b5L of a mixture of 7 mM teicoplanin, 142 mM [methyl-13C]-L-methionine, and 14.2 mM ClDA in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 50% d6-DMSO.3. Transfer the mixture of teicoplanin, [methyl-13C]-L-methionine, and ClDA mixture to the mixture of SalL and MtfA.4. Transfer the entire solution to a clean 5 mm NMR tube.5. Collect 13C-NMR spectra on a Varian VX500 NMR spectrometer at various time points. For each time point, we acquired data for \u2265 64 scans with a delay time (d1) of 5 seconds. In our hands, we observed the appearance of [methyl-13C]-N-teicoplanin within 3\u20139 hours, as evidenced by a 13C-NMR signal at \u03b4 = 33.7 ppm. 3.6 In situ Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of SAM Coupled to RGG Peptide Methylation by rPRMT1 Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is responsible for the majority of arginine methylation in mammalian cells. In the assay described below, rPRMT1, a rat homolog that dimethylates arginine residues, is used to couple in situ SAM production with methylation of arginine residues in the RGG peptide. Transfer of ethyl, allyl, and benzyl congeners of L-methionine has also been observed (Thomsen et al., 2013). Overall, sterics likely influences transfer since we observed RGG allylation, but did not observe RGG propylation, although the corresponding SAM analogs have similar sizes and are formed in situ at similar rates. RGG allylation most likely occurs via an SN2\u2032 mechanism.3.6.1 Reagents\u2022 RGG peptide (expressed and purified as described by Thomsen et al., 2013)Davis et al.Page 13Methods Enzymol.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSWe described procedures for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM and analogs that employ chlorinase SalL discovered from a marine actinomycete bacterium. Recombinant SalL can be purified from E. coli in relatively high yields, i.e. over 60 mg soluble enzyme per liter culture. The SalL-catalyzed synthesis of SAM analogs from L-methionine congeners and the stable and commercially available substrate 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine is diastereoselective. Moreover, we described methods for in situ synthesis of SAM coupled with DNA, protein and metabolite methylation, and with the incorporation of isotopes into biomolecules. In addition to SAM-dependent halogenases, numerous groups have used methionine adenosyltransferase wild type and mutants that accommodate structural changes in L-methionine and ATP to generate stable SAM analogs that alkylate a variety of acceptor substrates (Wang et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014; Huber, Wang, Singh, Johnson, Zhang, Sunkara et al., 2016; Huber, Johnson, Zhang, & Thorson, 2016). Overall, the development of chemoenzymatic methods and protein engineering efforts has expanded the structural scope of SAM analogs that can be generated for biological studies.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Financial support for this work was provided by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health (NIH), under grant KL2TR002002 (to A.S.E.), by NIH GM095970 (to M.D.B) and by startup funds from the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy and the Center for Biomolecular Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago (to A.S.E.).

        "StatesAbstract S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is universal in biology, serving as the second most common cofactor in a variety of enzymatic reactions. One of the main roles of SAM is the methylation of nucleic acids, proteins and metabolites. Methylation often imparts regulatory control to DNA and proteins, and leads to an increase in the activity of specialized metabolites such as those developed as pharmaceuticals. There has been increased interest in using SAM analogs in methyltransferase-catalyzed modification of biomolecules. However, SAM and its analogs are expensive and unstable, degrading rapidly under physiological conditions. Thus, the availability of methods to prepare SAM in situ are desirable. In addition, synthetic methods to generate SAM analogs suffer from low yields and poor diastereoselectivity. The chlorinase SalL from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica catalyzes the reversible, nucleophilic attack of chloride at the C5\u2032 ribosyl carbon of SAM leading to the formation of 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (ClDA) with concomitant displacement of L-methionine. It has been demonstrated that the in vitro equilibrium of the SalL-catalyzed reaction favors the synthesis of SAM. In this chapter, we describe methods for the preparation of SalL, and the chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM and SAM analogs from ClDA and L-methionine congeners using SalL. In addition, we describe procedures for the in situ chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM coupled to DNA, peptide and metabolite methylation, and to the incorporation of isotopes into alkylated",

        "a variety of substrates, including nucleic acid, proteins and small molecules (Cantoni, 1975; Thomsen, Vogensen, Buchardt, Burkart & Clausen, 2013), but also a source of methylene, amino, ribosyl and aminopropyl groups, in addition to 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radicals (Fontecave, Atta & Mulliez, 2004). Remarkably, SAM has also recently been shown to serve as cofactor in coordinating pericyclic reactions via electrostatic catalysis (Ohashi, Liu, Hai, Chen, Tang, Yang, et al., 2017). Another role for SAM is to serve as a substrate in reactions catalyzed by SAM-dependent halogenases of the 5\u2032-halo-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine synthase class (Dong, Huang, Deng, Schaffrath, Spencer, O\u2019Hagan & Naismith, 2004; Eust\u00e1quio, Pojer, Noel & Moore, 2008; Agarwal, Miles, Winter, Eust\u00e1quio, El Gamal & Moore,",
        "2017).Halogenated compounds are pervasive across all domains of life. Over 5,000 organohalogens are known. Organochlorines and organobromines are the most abundant with >2,000 known examples of each, whereas organoiodines are more scarce (<200) and organofluorines are very rare with only five rigorously identified compounds (Gribble, 2012; Chan & O\u2019Hagan, 2012, and Wang, Zhou, Fredimoses, Liao & Liu, 2014). Halogenating enzymes employ various mechanistic strategies depending on the properties of the halogen atom and the reactivity of the organic substrate. Most halogenases activate chloride, bromide and iodide via oxidation by utilizing cofactors such as heme-iron, vanadium, flavin and Fe(II)/\u03b1-ketoglutarate (Agarwal et al., 2017). For fluoride, on the other hand, which evades oxidation due to its extreme electronegativity, an orthogonal strategy has been described that uses SAM as co-substrate in an SN2-type, nucleophilic substitution reaction (Figure 1). The only fluorinase described thus far (FlA) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of fluoroacetate and fluorothreonine in the soil bacterium Streptomyces cattleya in which fluoride attacks the C5\u2032 electrophilic carbon of SAM, displacing L-methionine and generating 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (Dong et al.,",
        "2004).Four years after the structural characterization of the fluorinase, the chlorinase SalL was reported from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008). SalL is analogous to fluorinase and the only other characterized SAM-dependent halogenase of the 5\u2032-halo-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (XDA) synthase class (Figure 1). SalL catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008 and 2009; Feling, Buchanan, Mincer, Kauffman, Jensen & Fenical, 2003). Both FlA and SalL can also catalyze the reverse reaction, i.e. synthesis of SAM from XDA. For FlA, the in vitro equilibrium lies in favor of FDA by a factor of three (Dong et al., 2004). That the forward reaction is favored by FlA is unsurprising given that the C-F bond is the strongest bond in organic chemistry. For chlorinase SalL, on the other hand, synthesis of SAM from ClDA and L-met is favored, with the relative enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) for the reverse reaction (SAM synthesis) being several orders of magnitude higher than the forward halogenation reaction (Eust\u00e1quio et al., 2008). The fluorinase was also reported to favor the reverse reaction in vitro when using chloride as the halide (Deng, Cobb, McEwan, McGlinchey, Naismith, O\u2019Hagan et al.,",
        "2006).As a versatile methyl donor to biomolecules, there has been considerable interest in exploring the synthesis of SAM analogs of chemical and biological utility. For instance, non-natural SAM analogs could be used to modify cellular targets such as DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites. Moreover, SAM itself is an expensive and unstable cofactor,",

        "desirable.Traditionally, SAM analogs have been chemically synthesized from S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. However, this synthesis suffers from low yields and lack of diastereoselectivity (Dalhoff, Lukinavicius, Klimasauskas & Weinhold, 2006). Furthermore, SAM synthesis is challenging due to its inherent lability and tendency to racemize (Hoffman, 1986). Chemoenzymatic synthesis using chlorinase SalL and ClDA offers an alternative to chemical synthesis. In addition to being stable and commercially available, ClDA can also be synthesized economically from adenosine and SOCl2 (Sinhababu, Bartel, Pochopin & Borchardt 1985). Chemoenzymatic synthesis of SAM and analogs in situ could also be coupled with downstream applications such as methylation or alkylation by methyltransferases. This strategy can also be used for the facile incorporation of isotopes into alkylated",
        "products.We have demonstrated the use of SalL for the diastereoselective synthesis of SAM and SAM congeners from ClDA and L-met analogs (See section 3). We have also coupled the SalL-catalyzed production of SAM with DNA and with metabolite methylation (Lipson, Thomsen, Moore, Clausen, La Clair & Burkart 2013). Importantly, we have demonstrated that in situ generated SAM analogs were recognized by rat protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (rPRMT1) which alkylated its peptide substrate (Thomsen, Vogensen, Buchardt, Burkart, & Clausen",

        "AnalogsSAM is biosynthesized by methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT) from methionine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Cantoni, 1975; Figure 3). SAM is an essential cofactor for SAM-dependent methyltransferases to methylate various substrates including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules (Martin & McMillan 2002; Lin, 2011; Struck, Thompson, Wong & Micklefield, 2012; Bauerle, Schwalm, & Booker, 2015). While transmethylation produces small and modest chemical changes, these drastically affect molecular recognition of substrates by cellular targets to control processes such as epigenetic regulation of protein expression, neurotransmission, and natural products biosynthesis. The prevalence of SAM in cellular processes has inspired the development of analogs as chemical reporters for nucleic acid (Dalhoff Lukinavicius, Klimasauskas & Weinhold, 2006a; Dalhoff et al., 2006b; Lukinavicius, Lapiene, Stasevskij, Dalhoff, Weinhold & Klimasauskas 2007; Motorin, Burhenne, Teimer, Koynov, Willnow, Weinhold, et al., 2011; Vranken, Fin, Tufar, Hofkens, Burkart & Tor, 2016), protein (Peters, Willnow, Duisken, Kleine, Macherey, Duncan et al., 2010; Wang, Zheng, Yu, Deng & Luo, 2011; Islam, Zheng, Yu, Deng & Luo, 2011; Islam, Bothwell, Chen, Sengelaub, Wang, Deng & Luo, 2011; Wang, Islam, Liu, Zheng, Tang, Lailler et al., 2013; Wang & Luo, 2013; Islam, Chen, Wu,",

        "The preparation of SAM and its analogs is especially challenging due to inherent lability, tendency to racemize under experimental conditions, and rapid degradation at physiological pH (Hoffman, 1986). Chemical synthesis of SAM and SAM derivatives involves nucleophilic substitution between S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH or AdoCy) and an alkyl halide to produce a mixture of two sulfonium diastereomers, usually in variable yields (de la Haba, Jamieson, Mudd & Richards, 1959; Dalhoff et al., 2006; Stecher et al., 2009). The S,S diastereomer serves as the methyl donor, while the S,R diastereomer inhibits the methyltransferase (Borchardt & Wu, 1976; Khani-Oskouee, Jones, & Woodard, 1984). Additionally, analogs of SAM where sulfur is replaced with selenium are more reactive methyl donors due to the longer, weaker Se-C bonds and do not racemize (Iwig & Booker, 2004). Notably, select Se-adenosyl-L-selenomethionines (SeAM), i.e. propargyl SeAM, are more stable than their SAM analogs (Bothwell, Islam, Chen, Zheng, Blum, Deng et al., 2012; Bothwell & Luo, 2014). Overall, these early synthetic efforts ignited investigations in which non-natural SAM analogs could be used by endogenous methyltransferases to modify and profile various cellular",
        "targets.To complement chemical synthesis of SAM analogs, we pioneered chemoenzymatic methods to expand the range of SAM analogs available for labeling methyltransferase substrates (Lipson et al., 2013; Thomsen et al., 2013; Vranken et al., 2016). We employed two homologous halogenases, SalL and FlA, to produce SAM and SAM analogs. As discussed earlier, SalL catalyzes the reaction of SAM with chloride to produce 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (ClDA) and L-methionine via nucleophilic attack in Salinispora tropica (Figure 1). Similarly, Streptomyces cattleya uses fluorinase FlA to react fluoride with SAM to afford 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (FDA) and L-methionine. Based on Le Chatelier\u2019s Principle, we hypothesized that under low salt concentrations and excess L-methionine, these halogenases could catalyze the biologically reversed reaction to produce SAM in situ (Figure 3) from easily prepared ClDA. Indeed, we observed SAM production by both SalL and FlA in various buffers, including Tris, HEPES, and phosphate buffers at pH 7\u20138, although SalL produced SAM in substantially higher yields than FlA. Furthermore, we generated a W190A point mutant of SalL that could accommodate larger alkyl substrates (Thomsen et al., 2013). Both wild type (WT) and mutant SalL generated alkyl, allylic, and benzylic SAM analogs, although the WT was most effective at generating small SAM analogs (methyl, ethyl), whereas both the WT and W190A mutant were equally effective at producing larger SAM analogs (propyl, butyl, allyl, and benzyl). Importantly, we demonstrated that our in situ generated SAM congeners were recognized by nucleic acid, peptide, and small molecule methyltransferases, and alkylated their respective substrates (Thomsen et al.,",
