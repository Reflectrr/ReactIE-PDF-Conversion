Naismith,[b] and David O\u2019Hagan*[b] The fluorinase is an enzyme that catalyses the combination of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) and a fluoride ion to generate 5\u2019-fluorodeoxy adenosine (FDA) and l-methionine through a nucleophilic substitution reaction with a fluoride ion as the nucleophile. It is the only native fluorination enzyme that has been characterised. The fluorinase was isolated in 2002 from Streptomyces cattleya, and, to date, this has been the only source of the fluorinase enzyme. Herein, we report three new fluorinase isolates that have been identified by genome mining. The novel fluorinases from Streptomyces sp. MA37, No-cardia brasiliensis, and an Actinoplanes sp. have high homology (80\u201387 % identity) to the original S. cattleya enzyme. They all possess a characteristic 21-residue loop. The three newly iden-tified genes were overexpressed in E. coli and shown to be fluorination enzymes. An X-ray crystallographic study of the Streptomyces sp. MA37 enzyme demonstrated that it is almost identical in structure to the original fluorinase. Culturing of the Streptomyces sp. MA37 strain demonstrated that it not only also elaborates the fluorometabolites, fluoroacetate and 4-fluo-rothreonine, similar to S. cattleya, but this strain also produces a range of unidentified fluorometabolites. These are the first new fluorinases to be reported since the first isolate, over a decade ago, and their identification extends the range of fluorination genes available for fluorination biotechnology. The fluorinase (S-adenosyl-l-methionine:fluoride adenosyltrans-ferase) isolated from Streptomyces cattleya in 2002 is unusual in biochemistry in that it catalyses CNoneF bond formation from an inorganic fluoride ion.[1] This enzyme mediates a reaction between S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) and a fluoride ion to generate 5\u2019-fluorodeoxyadenosine (FDA) and l-methionine, the first step in the biosynthesis of fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluo-rothreonine (4-FT) from that organism.[2] The biosynthetic path-way to FAc and 4-FT has been evaluated in S. cattleya, and is il-lustrated in Scheme 1.[3] The fluorinase from S. cattleya has re-mained a unique curiosity for a decade. The most closely relat-ed genes to this enzyme were the duf-62 family (None30 % ho-mology), and a chlorinase (None40 % homology) from the marine organism Salinospora tropica, which carry out related transfor-mations on SAM but with nucleophiles other than fluoride ions.[4] There are over 200 duf-62 proteins in the available ge-nomes, many found in extremophile organisms. They have been shown to catalyse a reaction between SAM and a hydrox-ide ion, to generate adenosine.[5\u20137] In S. tropica the chlorinase catalyses a similar reaction to the fluorinase except it uses a chloride ion, for CNoneCl bond formation, as the first step in salinosporamide production.[8] We now report three new fluori-nase enzymes from three additional bacterial strains. These flu-orinases have been identified by genome mining, and they represent the first additions in a decade to the original S. catt-leya fluorinase identification. First, we identified a new bacterial isolate, Streptomyces sp. MA37, which was collected as a soil isolate in Ghana (5839\u201932.72\u2019\u2019 N, 0811\u201955.26\u2019\u2019 W). Analysis of the full genome se-quence identified flA1, a gene with high (87 %) homology to that of flA from S. cattleya.[9] A particularly diagnostic signature is a 21 amino acid loop, which is a unique characteristic of the S. cattleya enzyme relative to the chlorinase and duf-62 en-zymes. Overexpression of a codon-optimised synthetic flA1 gene in E. coli, with a His6 tag and a TEV protease cleavage site added,[10] allowed us to be isolate and purify the protein. In vitro assays of the recombinant enzyme, following His6 tag re-moval, demonstrated that it was competent to catalyse the conversion of SAM and a fluoride ion into 5\u2019-FDA.

MA37 has a capacity for 4-FT biosynthesis. Streptomyces sp. MA37 was grown in a shaking flask in a medium supplemented with fluoride (2 mm), and the supernatant was analysed by 19F NMR. The organism produced FAc (None217.44 ppm, t, 2JHF = 47.8 Hz) and 4-FT (None232.09 ppm, dt, 2JHF = 25 Hz, 3JHF = 47 Hz). The identity of 4-FT was further con-firmed by GC\u2013MS fragmentation, after N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) deri-vatisation.[11] Unlike S. cattleya, other unidentified fluorometabo-lites accumulate in the superna-tant, however, at lower levels than 4-FT (Figure 2). This ability of Streptomyces sp. MA37 to elaborate fluorometabolites, sug-gests that the flA1 gene plays a similar role to flA in S. cattleya in that it encodes the first trans-formation in fluorometabolite biosynthesis. The Streptomyces sp. MA37 flA1 gene was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA purified from the mycelium of Streptomyces sp. MA37. The overex-pressed FlA1 enzyme was crystallised and its structure deter-mined to 1.8 None resolution (full statistics can be found in Scheme 1. Biosynthetic pathway to FAc and 4-FT as established in S. cattleya. Table S1 in the Supporting Information) by molecular replace-ment using the original S. cattleya fluorinase coordinates.[12] Su-perimposition of the S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37 structures, as illustrated in Figure 3, shows that they are essen-tially identical in their monomeric structure. Both proteins form the same hexameric arrangement; essentially a dimer of trimers. The structure of the FlA1 enzyme is found to contain a bound adenosine, which was carried through from the purifi-cation. The tight binding of adenosine was first observed in the S. cattleya fluorinase enzyme, which can also carry adeno-sine through the purification and is bound in an identical loca-tion.[2] The residues that comprise the active site of FlA1 are shared between two protein monomers and their constellation is un-changed from our earlier description of the S. cattleya fluori-nase.[12] The sequence differences between these two enzymes are remote from the active site and do not result in any signifi-cant change in the structure. The 21 amino acid loop, shown most clearly in Figure 3 A, emerges as a characteristic of the fluorinase relative to duf-62 and chlorinase. It is partly disor-dered in the FlA1 structure (Figure 3 A). In 2012, the genome sequence of the hospital pathogen No-cardia brasiliensis HUJEG-1 (ATCC 700358) was placed into the public domain.[13, 14] Comparative genome analysis revealed that an open reading frame (ORF; YP_006809254; FlA2) had 81 % similarity to the fluorinase from S. cattleya. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated conserved active site residues and it also possessed the characteristic 21-residue found in the S. cattleya fluorinase.[12] A synthetic codon-optimised flA2 gene was designed based on the genome sequence. This gene was designed such that it carried a His6 tag to aid in purification and a TEV protease cleavage site.[10] The protein was success-fully overexpressed and purified and was subjected to an in vitro activity assay. The resulting enzyme was also competent in its ability to catalyse the conversion of SAM and a fluoride ion into 5\u2019-FDA. Other key biosynthetic genes are replicated in this genome and in particular a 4-FT transaldolase (flFT2), re-sponsible for the last step in 4-FT biosynthesis,[15, 17] is located very close to the flA2 gene indicating a capacity for 4-FT bio-synthesis. N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 (ATCC 700358) was grown in shaking-flask cultures with 2 mm fluoride in various media. Al-though healthy growth was established, in our laboratory, fluo-rometabolite production could not be detected by 19F NMR; this suggested that the enzyme has only a latent ability for flu-orometabolite production. Earlier this year, a third fluorinase candidate, ORF YP_ 007949809 (FlA3), was discovered in the deposited genome se-quence[16] of the actinomycete, Actinoplanes sp. N902-109. From the available sequence data, flA3 lies in a cluster of 14 ORFs. This gene has 80 % identity to the flA gene of S. cattleya and contains the same 21-residue loop. The organism also has Figure 3. Superimposition of structures of fluorinase enzymes from S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37. A) Superimposition of the monomeric fluorinase a 4-FT transaldolase (FlFT3) located close to the flA3 gene. A synthetic, E. coli codon-optimised gene was also designed, and the product was also shown to catalyse the production of 5\u2019-FDA from SAM in the presence of fluoride and is, therefore, a fluorinase. It remains to be determined if Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 is a producer of fluorometabolites. The organism, unlike the genome, is not in the public domain, but given the closely located flFT3 gene, it is likely that this organism has a capacity for 4-FT biosynthesis. A study of the reaction kinetics for all four fluorinases (Table 1) indicates that the original S. cattleya enzyme is the least efficient of those identified, although they are all rather slow enzymes with turnover numbers (kcat) of less than 0.3 minNone1. The identification of these new fluorinases offers four ge-nomes in which to compare and contrast the immediate envi-ronment of their respective flA genes[17, 18] (Figure 1). In S. catt-leya, flA is located immediately adjacent to the second biosyn-thetic enzyme, a purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP; flB), which catalyses the conversion of 5\u2019-FDA into 5\u2019-FDRP (Scheme 1). This is also the case for (flB1) found in Streptomy-ces sp. MA37, and for the N. brasiliensis and Actinoplanes sp., the flB homologues are situated one and five genes away from their respective flA genes. So it is a consistent feature that the fluorinase gene is located close to the PNP-expressing gene. This is also the case for the chlorinase in S. tropica.[8] However, the remaining four genes involved in fluorometabolite biosyn-thesis are scattered across the S. cattleya genome (Figure 1), and it is a feature of that genome that the biosynthetic genes are very remote from the (Spencer) cluster that contains the flA gene.[17] For all of these recently sequenced organisms, the degree of clustering appears more evolved. This is most strik-ing for the biosynthetic genes (flFT) encoding the 4-FT transal-dolase, which catalyses the last step in 4-FT biosynthesis. This gene is particularly remote from flA in S. cattleya, where it is not even on the chromosome but on a mega-plasmid, pSCATT (1.8 Mbp).[18] However, in the three newly sequenced genomes, the flFT genes are located very close to their respective flA ho-mologues, thus suggesting a more efficient translational cou-pling of their gene products. The gene flIso2 in the N. brasiliensis gene cluster encodes a methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase[19] and has high se-quence homology to the 5-FDRP isomerase (SCATT_20080), the third biosynthetic enzyme in S. cattleya. A homologue (flIso3) was also identified in the Actinoplanes sp. gene cluster. This suggests that flIso encodes the enzyme for the biosynthetic conversion of 5\u2019-FDRP into 5\u2019-FDRulP (Scheme 1) during FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis in these organisms. Again the S. cattleya homologue (flIso) of this gene is not located close to flA on the chromosome,[18] and overall S. cattleya appears to have the lowest degree of biosynthetic gene clustering of the genomes sequenced thus far. In conclusion, in silico analysis has revealed three novel fluo-rometabolite gene clusters in actinomycete species with high homologies to a known fluorinase (80 to 87 % identity) from S. cattleya. The fluorinase gene products from Streptomyces sp. MA37, N. brasiliensis and Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 were all shown by in vitro activity assays to function as fluorinases, and Streptomyces sp. MA37 produced FAc and 4-FT when grown in culture. The newly identified gene clusters have a higher degree of clustering of their biosynthetic genes relative to S. cattleya. The identification now of more than one fluorinase, and the associated genes for fluorometabolite production, ex-pands the genetic resources available for developing de novo organic fluorine biotransformations through microbial engi-neering.

        "In 2012, the genome sequence of the hospital pathogen No-cardia brasiliensis HUJEG-1 (ATCC 700358) was placed into the public domain.[13, 14] Comparative genome analysis revealed that an open reading frame (ORF; YP_006809254; FlA2) had 81 % similarity to the fluorinase from S. cattleya. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated conserved active site residues and it also possessed the characteristic 21-residue found in the S. cattleya fluorinase.[12] A synthetic codon-optimised flA2 gene was designed based on the genome sequence. This gene was designed such that it carried a His6 tag to aid in purification and a TEV protease cleavage site.[10] The protein was success-fully overexpressed and purified and was subjected to an in vitro activity assay. The resulting enzyme was also competent in its ability to catalyse the conversion of SAM and a fluoride ion into 5\u2019-FDA. Other key biosynthetic genes are replicated in this genome and in particular a 4-FT transaldolase (flFT2), re-sponsible for the last step in 4-FT biosynthesis,[15, 17] is located very close to the flA2 gene indicating a capacity for 4-FT bio-synthesis. N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 (ATCC 700358) was grown in shaking-flask cultures with 2 mm fluoride in various media. Al-though healthy growth was established, in our laboratory, fluo-rometabolite production could not be detected by 19F NMR; this suggested that the enzyme has only a latent ability for flu-orometabolite production.",
        "Earlier this year, a third fluorinase candidate, ORF YP_ 007949809 (FlA3), was discovered in the deposited genome se-quence[16] of the actinomycete, Actinoplanes sp. N902-109. From the available sequence data, flA3 lies in a cluster of 14 ORFs. This gene has 80 % identity to the flA gene of S. cattleya and contains the same 21-residue loop. The organism also has",
        "Figure 3. Superimposition of structures of fluorinase enzymes from S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37. A) Superimposition of the monomeric fluorinase",
        "a 4-FT transaldolase (FlFT3) located close to the flA3 gene. A synthetic, E. coli codon-optimised gene was also designed, and the product was also shown to catalyse the production of 5\u2019-FDA from SAM in the presence of fluoride and is, therefore, a fluorinase. It remains to be determined if Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 is a producer of fluorometabolites. The organism, unlike the genome, is not in the public domain, but given the closely located flFT3 gene, it is likely that this organism has a capacity for 4-FT biosynthesis.",
        "A study of the reaction kinetics for all four fluorinases (Table 1) indicates that the original S. cattleya enzyme is the least efficient of those identified, although they are all rather slow enzymes with turnover numbers (kcat) of less than 0.3 minNone1.",
        "The identification of these new fluorinases offers four ge-nomes in which to compare and contrast the immediate envi-ronment of their respective flA genes[17, 18] (Figure 1). In S. catt-leya, flA is located immediately adjacent to the second biosyn-thetic enzyme, a purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP; flB), which catalyses the conversion of 5\u2019-FDA into 5\u2019-FDRP (Scheme 1). This is also the case for (flB1) found in Streptomy-ces sp. MA37, and for the N. brasiliensis and Actinoplanes sp., the flB homologues are situated one and five genes away from their respective flA genes. So it is a consistent feature that the fluorinase gene is located close to the PNP-expressing gene. This is also the case for the chlorinase in S. tropica.[8] However, the remaining four genes involved in fluorometabolite biosyn-thesis are scattered across the S. cattleya genome (Figure 1), and it is a feature of that genome that the biosynthetic genes are very remote from the (Spencer) cluster that contains the flA gene.[17] For all of these recently sequenced organisms, the degree of clustering appears more evolved. This is most strik-ing for the biosynthetic genes (flFT) encoding the 4-FT transal-dolase, which catalyses the last step in 4-FT biosynthesis. This gene is particularly remote from flA in S. cattleya, where it is not even on the chromosome but on a mega-plasmid, pSCATT (1.8 Mbp).[18] However, in the three newly sequenced genomes, the flFT genes are located very close to their respective flA ho-mologues, thus suggesting a more efficient translational cou-pling of their gene products.",
        "The gene flIso2 in the N. brasiliensis gene cluster encodes a methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase[19] and has high se-quence homology to the 5-FDRP isomerase (SCATT_20080), the third biosynthetic enzyme in S. cattleya. A homologue (flIso3) was also identified in the Actinoplanes sp. gene cluster. This suggests that flIso encodes the enzyme for the biosynthetic conversion of 5\u2019-FDRP into 5\u2019-FDRulP (Scheme 1) during FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis in these organisms. Again the S. cattleya homologue (flIso) of this gene is not located close to flA on the chromosome,[18] and overall S. cattleya appears to have the lowest degree of biosynthetic gene clustering of the genomes sequenced thus far.",
        "In conclusion, in silico analysis has revealed three novel fluo-rometabolite gene clusters in actinomycete species with high homologies to a known fluorinase (80 to 87 % identity) from S. cattleya. The fluorinase gene products from Streptomyces sp. MA37, N. brasiliensis and Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 were all shown by in vitro activity assays to function as fluorinases, and Streptomyces sp. MA37 produced FAc and 4-FT when grown in culture. The newly identified gene clusters have a higher degree of clustering of their biosynthetic genes relative to S. cattleya. The identification now of more than one fluorinase, and the associated genes for fluorometabolite production, ex-pands the genetic resources available for developing de novo organic fluorine biotransformations through microbial engi-neering.",
