INTRODUCTIONThe knowledge about enzymatic halogenation has increased enormously during the last 15 years. The identification of FADH2-dependent haloge-nases and nonheme iron, \u03b1-ketoglutarate-and O2-dependent halogenases, the two types of halogenating enzymes shown to be involved in the bio-synthesis of halogenated metabolites, has also contributed substantially to the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters of halometabolites. Whereas the cloning, sequencing, and the construction of mutants in specific genes of these gene clusters have made the characterization of the biosyntheses of halometabolites on a genetic basis much easier, biochemical character-ization, such as analyses of in vitro activity of enzymes involved in these biosynthetic pathways, is still lacking behind. This is mostly due to the problem of identifying the natural substrates of these enzymes and the availability of these substrates.In this review, examples for the biosynthesis of halogenated alkaloids, derived from different precursor molecules, will be shown, illustrating the various degrees of knowledge about the pathways and the enzymatic reactions involved. II. PYRROLES A. PyrrolnitrinPyrrolnitrin (1) [3-chloro-4-(2\u2032-nitro-3\u2032-chlorophenyl)pyrrole; Figure 1] was isolated in 19641 as an antibiotic showing activity against fungi, yeast, and Gram-positive bacteria2 from Pseudomonas pyrrocinia. Later, 1 was found to be produced by a large variety of different bacteria such as Pseudomonas species, Burkholderia cepacia strains, Myxococcus fulvus, Cor-allococcus exiguous, Cystobacter ferrugineus, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Serratia.3,4 The antibiotic activity of 1 is mainly due to inhibition of glyc-erol kinase leading to accumulation of glycerol and thus leaky cell mem-branes.5 Early investigations into the biosynthesis of 1 by Lively et al. showed that 1 was derived from the aromatic amino acid tryptophan (2).6 NH NO2Cl Cl Pyrrolnitrin 1Figure 1 Chemical structure of pyrrolnitrin Biosynthesis\tof\tHalogenated\tAlkaloids\t \t \t \t 169 Detailed studies using multiple-labeled 2 showed that the indole nitro-gen gives rise to the nitro group nitrogen, whereas the nitrogen of the amino group was incorporated into the pyrrole ring. All carbon atoms with the exception of the carboxylic acid group were incorporated into 1.7 However, the question whether the d-or the l-enantiomer of 2 was the starting point for the biosynthesis of 1 could not be answered, although the d-enantiomer of 2 seemed more likely since addition of the d-enan-tiomer of 2 resulted in enhanced production of 1.8 The isolation of ami-nopyrrolnitrin (3) led to the conclusion that the oxidation of the amino to the nitro group was the last step in the biosynthesis of 1.9 2-Carboxy-4-(2\u2032-amino-3\u2032-chlorophenyl)pyrrole was isolated by Salcher et al.10, and monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin (4) could be obtained by incubation of 1-producing Pseudomonas species under chloride-limiting conditions in the presence of 7-chlorotryptophan (5), suggesting the chlorination of 2 to be the first step in the biosynthesis of 1.11 Furthermore, the isolation of carboxy-4-(2\u2032-amino-3\u2032-chlorophenyl)pyrrole and monodechloroami-nopyrrolnitrin (5) suggested the ring rearrangement to occur before the second chlorination step.First attempts to isolate the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 from Pseu-domonas fluorescens led to the detection of a global regulator required for the formation of chitinase, cyanide, and pyrrolnitrin by P. fluorescens.12,13 Employment of this regulator to complement a wild-type P. fluorescens strain lacking this global regulator to induce the formation of 1 allowed the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1.14 The genes prnA\u2013D were identified as being sufficient to allow pyrrolnitrin production in Escherichia coli. Detailed analysis into the function of the corresponding enzymes PrnA\u2013D via the construction of individual mutants revealed that PrnA was a tryptophan 7-halogenase that showed no obvious sequence similarity to any enzyme known until that date. Detailed analysis of PrnA revealed that this enzyme is a flavin-dependent halogenase requiring FADH2 and oxygen for its chlorinating activity. Isolated PrnA does not contain flavin. FADH2 is produced by a flavin reductase and is then bound by the halogenase where it reacts with oxygen to form a flavin hydro-peroxide in a reaction similar to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. This flavin hydroperoxide is attacked by a chloride ion bound close to the iso-alloxazine ring of flavin leading to the formation of hypochlorous acid. This hypochlorous acid cannot leave the active site but diffuses toward the substrate that is bound about 10\u00c5 away from the flavin.15 A more detailed description of the mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases can be found below (Section VI.A.).PrnB was identified as the enzyme catalyzing the rearrangement of tryptophan (2) into a phenylpyrrole derivative. PrnB is a heme-containing dioxygenase that shows high structural similarity to trypto-phan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).16,17 170\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e However, albeit the high structural similarity between the enzymes, the product of the reaction catalyzed by PrnB is quite different from that of the reaction catalyzed by TDO and IDO. TDO and IDO catalyze the formation of N-formylkynurenine (6), thus cleaving the indole ring between C-2 and C-3 by introducing two oxygen atoms (Scheme 1). PrnB cleaves the indole ring between the indole ring nitrogen and C-2 of the indole ring. Concomitant formation of a new pyrrole ring by attack of the amino group of tryptophan at C-2 of the indole ring leads to the formation of the aminophenylpyrrole derivative monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin (4). It is suggested that the indole ring is opened by the incorporation of oxygen; however, the two oxy-gen atoms are lost during formation of the pyrrole ring as is the carboxyl group of 2. Thus, only a very early common intermediate of the reactions catalyzed by TDO, IDO, and PrnB is possible from which the TDO/IDO-catalyzed reaction diverges from that catalyzed by PrnB (Scheme 1).16,17 Structural analysis of PrnB in complex with the d-and the l-enantiomers of 2 and the d-and l-enantiomers of 5 have shown that only the binding of the l-enantiomers leads to productive binding of the substrate. Thus, only the l-enantiomer of 5 can be used as the starting point for the biosynthesis of 1.PrnC was shown to catalyze the regioselective chlorination of the phenylpyrrole derivative 4 formed by the action of PrnB. PrnC has high sequence homology to the halogenating enzyme involved in 7-chlorotetracycline biosynthesis.14,18 The final step in the biosynthesis of 1 is catalyzed by aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase (PrnD). PrnD was identi-fied as the enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of the amino group of 3 to the nitro group of 1.19 PrnD is a Rieske N-oxygenase that requires reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) formed by a flavin reductase.20,21 PrnD has a rather broad substrate specificity. It accepts a variety of not only aminophenylpyrrole derivatives22 but also p-aminobenzylamine, p-ami-nobenzyl alcohol, and p-aminophenylalanine.20 The data obtained from feeding experiments, isolation of intermediates, and the molecular genetic data resulted in the biosynthetic pathway shown in Scheme 2.The isolation of derivatives of 1 chlorinated at different positions or lacking chlorine atoms at specific positions can be explained by the less strict substrate specificity or regioselectivity of PrnC, the second haloge-nase involved in pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis compared to the very high substrate specificity and regioselectivity of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA. No derivative of 1 has been isolated with a chlorine atom at the phenyl ring at a position differing from the 7-position of the indole ring. However, isopyrrolnitrin (7) lacks the chlorine atom at the phenyl ring but contains two chlorine atoms at positions 2 and 3 of the pyrrole ring (Scheme 2).23Whereas PrnA accepts the l-as well as the d-enantiomer of 2 as a sub-strate,3 PrnB, the second enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, can only use the l-enantiomer. However, PrnB accepts the l-enantiomer of tryptophan Biosynthesis\tof\tHalogenated\tAlkaloids\t \t \t \t 171 (2) as well as the l-enantiomer of 7-chlorotryptophan (5). The formation of isopyrrolnitrin (7) could be explained by the reaction of PrnB on 2 fol-lowed by dichlorination of 3-(2-aminophenyl)pyrrole (8) to isoaminopyr-rolnitrin (9) by the second halogenase PrnC followed by oxidation of the amino group catalyzed by PrnC (Scheme 2).Fe O O N H Cl COO NH3 N H Cl COO NH2 Fe O O H N COO NH2 H OH Cl O 2-Fe N NH2 Cl COO H OH O 2-Fe N N H Cl COO H H O 2-Fe H + OH2 N H N H COO Cl H + NH NH2 Cl C O O O 2-Fe O 2-Fe CO2 NH NH2 Cl O 2-Fe H + Fe OH2 N H O O Cl COO NH3 + ---+ -+ --+ -+ -2 + 2e-+ -+ 6-Chlor-N-formylkynurenine 67-Chloro-L-tryptophan 5Monodechloroamino-pyrrolnitrin 4II IV IV IVIVIV IV IV II Scheme 1 Proposed reaction mechanism for the formation of the phenylpyrrole derivative 4 from the l-enantiomer of 5 catalyzed by the heme enzyme PrnB.7 It is not known, yet, how the reduction of the enzyme from the FeIV state to the FeII state is achieved.

The regioselectivity of PrnC with bromide as the halide substrate is obviously more relaxed than with chlo-ride since a number of different brominated derivatives of 3 and 1 have been isolated.22,24N H COO NH3 -+  PrnA(Tryptophan 7-halogenase)FADH2, O2,Cl N H NH3 Cl COO-+  PrnB(heme enzyme)O2, compound XNH NH2Cl L-Tryptophan 27-Chloro-L-tryptophan 5Monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin 4 PrnC (Monodechloroamino-pyrrolnitrin 3-halogenase)NH NH2Cl Cl  PrnD (Aminopyrrol-nitrin oxygenase)FADH2, O2,Cl NH NO2Cl Cl  PrnB(heme enzyme)O2, compound XNH NH2 3-(2-Aminophenyl)pyrrole 8Pyrrolnitrin 1NH NH2 Cl Cl  PrnD (Aminopyrrol-nitrin oxygenase)FADH2, O2,Cl O2, FADH2NH NO2 Cl Cl Isopyrrolnitrin 7 PrnC(Monodechloro-aminopyrrolnitrin  3-halogenase)Aminopyrrolnitrin 3Isoaminopyrrolnitrin 9O2, FADH2Scheme 2 Proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of 1 including by-products formed due to relaxed substrate specificity and regioselectivity of PrnB and PrnC, respectively. The main pathway is the pathway to 1 via the L-enantiomer of 5. FADH2, required for the reactions catalyzed by the halogenases PrnA, PrnC, and the aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase PrnD, is provided by flavin Biosynthesis\tof\tHalogenated\tAlkaloids\t \t \t \t 173 The two halogenases, tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA) and monode-chloroaminopyrrolnitrin-3 halogenase (MCAP-3 halogenase) (PrnC) as well as the aminopyrrolnitrin oxidase (PrnD), are two-component sys-tems requiring a flavin reductase. Since a flavin reductase gene (prnF) was found very close to the four genes (prnA\u2013D) considered to consti-tute the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic gene cluster, prnF was suggested to be part of the cluster.25 However, PrnF can be substituted by a variety of flavin reductases in the halogenase reaction26\u201329 as well as in the ami-nopyrrolnitrin oxygenase system,20 and no specific interaction between the halogenases and aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase with the reductases seems to be required. A mutant lacking the flavin reductase gene prnF even shows increased production of 1 compared to the wild-type strain (Hatscher and van P\u00e9e, unpublished results). Additionally, prnF is not required as part of the cluster to obtain pyrrolnitrin production in a het-erologous host.14 B. PyoluteorinPyoluteorin (10, Figure 2) is an antifungal antibiotic produced by several fluorescent Pseudomonas spp.,30,31 some of which also produce 1.32 In con-trast to 1, 10 is not derived from 2. Feeding studies using [1,2-13C2]acetate showed that the resorcinol moiety of 10 is formed via polyketide biosynthe-sis,33 whereas the pyrrole ring was found to originate from proline (11).34 A genomic region required for the biosynthesis of 10 was identified in P. fluorescens Pf-5, the producer of 10.35 Nowak-Thompson et al. reported on the isolation of two polyketide synthase (PKS) genes required for the biosynthesis of 10.36 These PKS genes showed high similarity to type I PKS genes. In 1999, the complete biosynthetic gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 10 was characterized.34 The cluster contains 10 genes (pltA\u2013G, pltL\u2013M, and pltR) within a 24-kb genomic region. Eight of these genes (pltA\u2013G and pltM) were suggested to be directly involved in the biosynthesis of 10. Individual destruction of each of these genes resulted in loss of the pro-duction of 10. pltR was proposed to function as a transcriptional activator. At first, no function could be suggested for pltL. However, later PltL was identified as a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) required for the binding of 11 after activation by the prolyl-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) ligase PltF.37 pltB and pltC showed high homology to type I polyketide biosyn-thetic genes, whereas pltA, pltD, and pltM showed homology to FADH2-dependent halogenases. However, in PltD, the two regions found in all flavin-dependent halogenases, the nucleotide-binding site (GxGxxG) and a motif containing two tryptophan residues (WxWxIP), were not strictly conserved, suggesting that PltD does not function as a halogenase. PrnE shows homology to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and was suggested to cat-alyze the formation of pyrrole carboxylic acid from 11. Dorrestein et al. 174\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e demonstrated that PrnE catalyzes the dehydrogenation of 11 bound to the PCP PltL (12) (Scheme 3).28According to these results obtained by different groups, 10 is pro-duced via a mixed nonribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPs)/polyketide synthesis (PKs) pathway. The biosynthesis starts with 11 that is acti-vated by the prolyl-AMP ligase PltF and transferred onto the PCP PltL. PltL-tethered 11 is then dehydrogenated by the flavin-dependent dehy-drogenase PrnE. Whether PrnE catalyzes only the introduction of the first double bond followed by spontaneous formation of the second double bond in the presence of oxygen or whether PltE catalyzes the formation of both double bonds is not known. Dorrestein et al. showed that PltL-bound pyrrole carboxylic acid 13 can be dichlorinated by the FADH2-dependent halogenase PltA.28 Whether PltA also catalyzes the incorporation of both chlorine atoms of pyoluteorin in vivo or whether one is incorporated via the action of the second FADH2-dependent haloge-nase PltM has not been investigated. As already mentioned above, PltD, which shows high overall similarity to flavin-dependent halogenases, is definitely not a halogenase; however, its real function is not known, yet.

Using three malonyl-CoA molecules for elongation and the activities of a ketoreductase domain and a dehydratase domain in the second polyketide synthase PltC followed by cyclization catalyzed by PltG would give the dihydroxycyclohexanone intermediate 15. For the formation of 10 as the final product, a dehydrogenase would be required (Scheme 4). However, so far, no gene for an additional dehydrogenase has been found in the cluster.NH2 COO + -PltF/PltE ATP, PltL, FAD PPi, AMP, FADH2 N H C O S PltL  PltA(FADH2-dependent  halogenase)FADH2, O2,Cl N H C O Cl S PltLProline 11 5-Chloro-pyrrolyl-S-PltL Pyrrolyl-S-PltL 13  PltA(FADH2-dependent  halogenase)FADH2, O2,Cl N H C O S PltL Cl Cl  4,5-Dichloro-pyrrolyl-S-PltL 143 x Malonyl-CoAN H OH OH O Cl Cl Pyoluteorin 10ACP KR AT KS ACP AT KSModule 2          Module 1 ACP KR DH AT KS PltG (Thio-esterase) Module 3Dehydrogenase?

PltD is not shown in this figure since its function is not 176\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e C. PyrrolomycinsPyrrolomycins (16) (Figure 3) are structurally closely related to 10 (Figure 2). Some of the pyrrolomycins contain a nitro group (pyrrolomycin A, B, G, H and dioxapyrrolomycin). In contrast to 10, they all contain, with the exception of pyrrolomycin A (16A), two chlorine atoms at the phenyl ring. Feeding experiments have shown that labeled acetate is incorporated into the phenyl ring but not into the pyrrole ring. Feeding of 15N-labeled 11 resulted in 16 labeled in the pyrrole ring nitrogen only but not in the nitro group. The nitro group, however, was labeled when a Na15NO3-enriched medium was used.38 This clearly points toward a biosynthetic pathway very similar to that of 10 with the phenyl ring being formed via polyketide biosynthesis and the pyrrole ring via NRPs. In contrast to the biosynthesis of 1 during which the nitro group is formed by oxidation of an amino group, biosynthesis of 16 would employ a nitration reaction as known from the formation of the 4-nitro-tryptophan moiety of the thaxomins.39Zhang and Parry cloned the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 16 from Actinosporangium vitaminophilum.40 The polyketide synthase Pyr25 consists of two modules, and the polyketide synthase Pyr24 consists of one module. This is identical to the situation in the biosynthesis of 10. Interestingly, mod-ule 2 of Pyr25 contains a ketoreductase gene that was suggested to be non-functional in the biosynthesis of 10. The presence of a ketoreductase gene in a polyketide synthase in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 10 as well as in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 16 suggests that it might actually be required for the biosyntheses of 10 and 16. However, module 3 does not contain a dehydratase gene that is present in the corresponding polyketide synthase module from the biosynthesis of 10 but was also suggested to be inactive.

On the other hand, the domains contained in the three modules are not quite sufficient to fully explain the formation of the phenyl ring since the dihydroxycyclohexanone intermedi-ate 17 formed via the activity of the thioesterase Pyr26 needs to be dehydrated twice to give the phenol ring of 16. It is suggested that these dehydration reactions could occur spontaneously. There is no information concerning the reduction of the keto group to the methylene group of the pyrrolomycins.Due to the high similarity of the cloned halogenase genes from A. vitaminophilum, the producer of 16, with those from P. fluorescens Pf-5, the producer of 10, it can be assumed that one FADH2-dependent haloge-nase (Pyr29) catalyzes the chlorination of the PCP-bound pyrrole carboxylic acid 18 at positions 2 and 3; however, no experimental data to support this assumption have been presented so far. Although some of the pyrrolomycins contain five chlorine atoms, only two additional genes for FADH2-dependent halogenases have been detected. Interestingly, a gene with an overall homol-ogy to genes of FADH2-dependent halogenases, but lacking the conserved nucleotide-binding site motif like PltD from the biosynthesis of 10, was found in the cluster. The function of the corresponding enzyme is not known, yet. A flavin reductase gene (pyr9) was also found in the cluster. The role of Pyr9 could be to produce FADH2 for the FADH2-dependent halogenases. No gene with similarity to a nitric oxide synthase has been detected in the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 16, and no experimental data concerning the mech-anism of the nitration reaction have been presented, so far. A hypothetical pathway for the biosynthesis of 16 is shown in Scheme 5. D. PentachloropseudilinThe biosynthesis of the phenylpyrrole alkaloid pentachloropseudilin (19, Figure 4) by Actinoplanes sp.

Interest-ingly, as in the biosynthesis of 10 as well as in the biosynthesis of 16, a gene (pcpL) with high homology to FADH2-dependent halogenases, but lacking a correct nucleotide-binding motif (GxGxxG) and the so-called tryptophan motif (WxWxIP), was also found in the gene cluster for the biosynthesis NH2 COO + -Pyr8/Pyr7 ATP, Pyr28, FAD PPi, AMP, FADH2 N H C O S  Pyr29(FADH2-dependent  halogenase)FADH2, O2,Cl N H C O S Cl Cl Proline 11 4,5-Dichloro-pyrrolyl-S-Pyr28 Pyrrolyl-S-Pyr28 18Pyr28 Pyr28 Pyr25, Pyr24 (Polyketide synthases)3 x Malonyl-CoAACP KR AT KS ACP AT KSModule 2          Module 1 S R O OS R O OH O ACP KR AT KS SO OH R OH O Pyr26 (Thio-esterase) Pyrrolomycins 16Module 3Pyr24 Pyr25 DH?

In contrast to the gene clusters for the biosyntheses of 10 and 16, no thioesterase was found in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 19.

PentabromopseudilinPentabromopseudilin (21, Figure 5) is produced by the marine bacterium Alteromonas luteoviolaceus. Its chemical structure is identical to that of 19 with the exception that it contains five bromine atoms instead of five chlorine atoms. The producer of 21 is not able to produce 19 and the producer of 19 cannot produce 21. Obviously, the halogenases involved are highly specific concerning their halide substrate. As in the case of 10, 16, and 19, the pyrrole ring is derived from 11 according to feeding studies.43 However, the lack of incorporation of acetate into 21 suggests that, unlike in the biosynthesis of 19, the phenyl ring is not formed via polyketide biosynthesis. Instead, it was shown that glucose and p-hydroxybenzoic acid 22 are incorporated suggesting the phenyl ring to be derived from the shikimate pathway.43 In the case of 21, no molecular genetic data are available, so far.

The various derivatives of 23 show differences in the extent of substitution and in the stereochemistry of the constitu-ent residues. All derivatives of 23 contain a dichlorinated pyrroloindole derivative, and kutznerides 4 and 8 contain an additional chlorine atom at the 1,2-diazacyclohexane moiety of 23. Whereas the incorporation of the two chlorine atoms into the pyrroloindole moiety was assumed to be catalyzed by FADH2-dependent halogenases, incorporation of the chlo-rine atom into the 1,2-diazacyclohexane moiety was most likely catalyzed by a nonheme iron, O2-and \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenase. Such an enzyme was also hypothesized to be involved in the formation of the cyclopropyl moiety (24) of 23.47 Thus, degenerate primers for these two types of halogenases could be successfully employed in the screening of a cosmid library of the producer of 23. The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 23 consists of 29 open reading frames (ORFs). For 17 of these ORFs, roles in the biosynthesis of 23 have been assigned. Biosynthesis of 23 is suggested to start with l-isoleucine 25, which is transferred onto the PCP KtzC. This KtzC-tethered 25 is then chlorinated at the terminal methyl group by KtzD, a nonheme iron halogenase. This chlorination reaction is cryptic since the chlorine atom serves as a leaving group allowing the formation of the cyclopropyl ring catalyzed by the dehydrogenase KtzA. Subsequent hydrolysis of the thioester bond catalyzed by KtzF results in the formation of free 2-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-l-glycine (l-MecPGly) 24 (Scheme 8), which is then loaded onto the nonribosomal peptide synthe-tase KtzE. The next NRPS (KtzE) is suggested to be responsible for the isomerization of 24 to its d-enantiomer. The next NRPS, KtzG, is suggested to be responsible for the formation of the \u03b2-branched \u03b1-hydroxy acid O N Cl Cl NH N O N H O OH O N H O N H N O MeOH OMe O OR1 R2 R3 R5 R4 R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 Kutzneride 1 (S)-OHH H H Me Kutzneride 2 (S)-OHCl H H Me Kutzneride 3 (R)-OH HH H Me Kutzneride 4 (R)-OHH \u03c0-bond \u03c0-bond Me Figure 6 Chemical structures of kutznerides 1\u20134 182\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e monomer from 3,3-dimethyl butyric acid involving NADH-dependent reduction of the keto group by the ketoreductase (KR) domain of KtzG. The 1,2-diazacyclohexane residue onto which the dipeptide is transferred is probably formed from glutamate and glutamine via the activity of the lysine/ornithine N-monooxygenase KtzI.Chlorination of the 1,2-diazacyclohexane derivative was shown by Jiang et al. to be catalyzed by a second nonheme iron halogenase (KthP) whose gene was found outside of the cluster.48 KthP only accepts the (3S)-1,2-diazacyclohexane residue bound to a thiolation domain (26) but not the (3R) epimer. Interestingly, only the 1,2-diaza-3S,5S-5-chlorocyclohex-ane derivative (27) is formed and not the 3S,5R stereoisomer found in the mature kutznerides suggesting further processing of 27 (Scheme 9).KtzH, a four-module NRPS consisting of 5260 amino acids, is suggested to catalyze the incorporation of the remaining four amino acid residues (piperazate3-O-Me-Ser4-3-OH-Glu5-diClPIC6). The tricyclic dichlo rinated pyrroloindole moiety is derived from tryptophan (2) that is dichlorinated as a free substrate by the tandem action of the two FADH2-dependent halogenases KtzQ and KtzR. From enzyme kinetic studies of the KtzQ-and KtzR-catalyzed chlorination of tryptophan (2), it was concluded that KtzQ catalyzes the first chlorination at position 7 of the indole ring fol-lowed by chlorination of the 6-position catalyzed by KtzR.49 The forma-tion of the unusual tricyclic pyrroloindole ring that can also be found in pyrroindomycins A and B (28, Figure 7)50 is suggested to be catalyzed by KtzM. KtzM is proposed to be a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase.

However, no experi-mental data for KtzM supporting its suggested role in the biosynthesis of 23 are available, so far. A hypothetical pathway for the  biosynthesis of the derivative 2 of 23 is shown in Scheme 10. B. PyrroindomycinsPyrroindomycins A and B (28) (Figure 7) consist of an indolopyrrole ring connected via a trisaccharide to a macrocyclic polyketide moiety that con-tains a tetramic acid moiety (29) (Figure 7, Scheme 12).50 Whereas pyr-roindomycin A does not contain a chlorine atom, pyrroindomycin B is chlorinated at the 5-position of the indole ring. The indolopyrrole ring is derived from tryptophan (2).51 The macrocyclic polyketide shows simi-larity to the polyketide moiety of chlorotrycin.52 However, instead of the NH NH O S T ? ? 1,2-Diaza-(3S)-cyclohexaneyl-S-T  26 KthP(nonheme iron halogenase)\u03b1 -Keto-Cl glutarate, SuccinateO2 NH NH O S T Cl 1,2-Diaza-(3S,5S)-5-chlorocyclo-hexaneyl-S-TThioesterase NH NH O O Cl  1,2-Diaza-(3S,5S)-5-chlorocyclohexane 27 KtzHA-domain ATP, KtzH T-domain PPi, AMP, NH NH O S Cl T-KtzH ?

The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 28 was detected by screening of a cosmid library of Streptomyces rugosporus, the producer of 28, using PCR primers derived from the conserved sequences of FADH2-dependent halogenases.53 PyrH, the halogenase detected during this screening, was identified as an FADH2-dependent, regioselective tryptophan 5-haloge-nase. Analysis of a gene disruption mutant in the tryptophan 5-haloge-nase gene showed that this mutant only produced the nonchlorinated derivative of 28. Chlorination of 2 in the 5-position was thus shown to be the first step in the biosynthesis of 28 (Scheme 11).Nothing is known yet about the formation of the tricyclic indolopyrrole moiety 31, although a similarity to the tricyclic hexahydropyrroloindole moiety of kutznerides (23) and the proposed intermediate in the ring rear-rangement reaction in the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin (1) seems quite likely. However, whereas during the biosynthesis of 1 the carboxylic acid group of tryptophan (2) is lost, in the biosyntheses of 23 and 28, it is used to connect the tricyclic ring system via a peptide or an ester bond, respectively, to other parts of the molecule. In the case of 28, the indolopyrrole moiety is con-nected to the polyketide moiety via a trisaccharide moiety. The monomers of the trisaccharide moiety are derived from glucose by derivatization of nucleoside diphosphate-tethered glucose. The NDP-activated sugars (32) are then transferred to the polyketide by glycosyltransferases.The tetramic acid moiety is produced via polyketide biosynthesis with incorporation of an amino acid. This amino acid is suggested to be serine (33) that would be activated and transferred onto a PCP. The PCP-bound serine (34) is then suggested to react with the octahydronaphthalene derivative 35.

PyrD4, homolog of C-terminal domain of KijE from kijanimicin biosynthesis, could then catalyze the formation of the lactame ring leading to the free intermediate 37. Generation of the spirotetramide ring is hypothesized to be catalyzed by PyrE3 via dehy-dratization to the intermediate 38 followed by a cyclization to give the spirotetramide ring system of the final polyketide aglycon 29 (Scheme 12).So far, there is hardly any information available about the sequence of reactions in which the individual parts of 28 are put together. Scheme 12 shows a proposal for the formation of the tetramic acid-containing polyketide moiety of 28 and the origin of the other moieties required for formation of the final product 28 according to Patallo et al. (unpublished results). C. ThienodolinThienodolin (6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carbamide; 39, Figure 8) was isolated during a screening for compounds showing plant growth-regu-lating effects.55,56 A halogenase gene (thal or thiH) was isolated from an enriched gene library of the producer of 39, Streptomyces albogriseolus.57 Heterologous overexpression of the halogenase gene in a P. fluorescens strain allowed the purification and biochemical characterization of the enzyme. It could be shown that Thal/ThiH was an FADH2-dependent tryptophan halogenase that catalyzes the regioselective chlorination and bromination of the l-and d-enantiomers of tryptophan (2). The haloge-nase gene was used for the screening of a cosmid library of S. albogriseolus leading to the detection and isolation of the biosynthetic gene cluster of 39. The construction of gene disruption mutants of S. albogriseolus showed that Thal catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of 39. Without Thal, and thus no formation of 6-chlorotryptophan (40), biosynthesis of 39 can-not proceed. The disruption of an amido transferase gene (thiD) revealed that formation of the amide group of 39 was the last step in the biosyn-thesis of 39. In vitro analysis of the amido transferase ThiD showed that it requires ATP for the transfer of an amino group onto its substrate 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylate (41).58The incorporation of the sulfur atom into 39 is still a mystery. None of the genes detected in the cluster show any similarity to genes known to code for sulfur-transferring enzymes. A proposal for a biosynthetic pathway for the formation of thienodolin involving the formation of 6-chloroindole-3-pyruvate (42) catalyzed by the aminotransferase ThiC is shown in Scheme 188\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e IV.

Biosynthetic studies showed that 43 is derived from two molecules of tryptophan (2), one glucose and one methionine molecule.60 The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 43 was detected using an internal fragment of the N-glycosyltransferase gene from the biosynthesis of the indolocar-bazole staurosporine61 for screening of a cosmid library of L. aerocolonige-nes. To verify that the isolated cosmids contained genes of the gene cluster for biosynthesis of 43, these cosmids were subjected to PCR analysis with degenerate primers for FADH2-dependent halogenases.62 Further analysis of cosmids containing the N-glycosyltransferase as well as the halogenase gene allowed the isolation and sequencing of the complete gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 43.63The first step in rebeccamycin biosynthesis is the regioselective chlo-rination of tryptophan (2) by the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH. FADH2 required by RebH might be provided by the flavin reductase RebF. The next step is catalyzed by the 7-chloro-l-tryptophan oxidase RebO that converts 7-chlorotryptophan (5) to 7-chloroindole-3-pyruvic acid (44). Although this l-amino oxidase also accepts 2 as a substrate, its catalytic efficiency with 5 is about 57 times higher than that with 2 as the sub-strate.64 The next step is suggested to be catalyzed by the chromopyrrolic acid synthase RebD. RebD has 54% sequence identity to the analogous enzyme (StaD) from staurosporine biosynthesis. A rebD-disruption mutant did not produce any indolocarbazole-related compound. In the reaction catalyzed by RebD, 44 produced in the RebO reaction is suggested to react with a second molecule of 5 to form 11,11\u2032-dichlorochromopyr-rolic acid (45).65 Nishizawa et al. and Howard-Jones and Walsh suggest that 44 should react with 7-chloroindole-3-pyruvate imine (7-chlorode-hydrotryptophan, 46) that is proposed to be an intermediate in the RebO-catalyzed reaction.64,66 The mechanism for the RebD-catalyzed reaction O OH OH OCH3 OH N H N N H O O Cl Cl Rebeccamycin 43Figure 9 Chemical structure of rebeccamycin 190\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e leading to the formation of the bis-indole core of 43 as proposed by How-ard-Jones and Walsh66 is shown in Scheme 14. The formation of the bis-indole core starts with the condensation of a 7-chloroindole-3-pyruvate imine (46) with its corresponding enamine tautomeric form (47) to yield the intermediate 48. This intermediate is favored as a substrate for the following oxidative coupling step by Howard-Jones and Walsh66 due to the inherent stability of its highly conjugated skeleton and its ability to participate in one-electron oxidation involving hydrogen abstraction. Abstraction of a hydrogen radical is suggested to lead to formation of 49 allowing formation of the pyrrolic C-3 to C-4 bond, and abstraction of a second hydrogen radical followed by tautomerization would yield the dicarboxypyrrole 45.It is proposed that 45 is oxidized by RebP followed by an oxida-tion at C-7 by RebC to give the rebeccamycin aglycon 50. The final two steps would be the glycosylation at N-12 with glucose catalyzed by the N-glycosyltransferase RebG followed by methylation of the glucose by RebM that uses S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl group donor63 (Scheme 15). B.  Cladoniamides and BE-54017Cladoniamides (51\u201353) are bis-indole alkaloids with an unusual indeno-tryptoline structure (Figure 10) whose biosynthesis is closely related to the biosynthesis of the indolocarbazole 43. 51\u201353 are produced by the lichen-associated actinomyces strain Streptomyces uncialis.68 In contrast to 43, 51\u201353 as well as BE-54017 (54),69 are chlorinated in the position corresponding to the 5-position of the indole ring of tryptophan (2). However, the major difference between 43 and 51\u201353/54 is that in the indenotryptoline scaf-fold of 51\u201353/54, one indole ring is \u201cflipped\u201d relative to the other. Albeit this structural difference, Williams et al. had suggested that 54 could be derived from an indolocarbazole intermediate by enzymatic degradation and rearrangement of this intermediate.68The gene cluster for the biosyntheses of 51\u201353 was isolated by screen-ing a cosmid library of the S. uncialis, the producer of 51\u201353, by PCR using primers for the rebC analog in the biosyntheses of 51\u201353.70The gene cluster for the biosyntheses of 51\u201353 and its derivatives has been isolated from environmental DNA using primers designed to detect oxytryptophan dimerization genes.71The first five steps in the biosyntheses of 43 and 51\u201353/54 are identical with the exception of the position of chlorination of the starter molecule tryptophan (2). In the biosyntheses of 51\u201353/54, chlorination is catalyzed by an FADH2-dependent tryptophan 5-halogenase (ClaH). The second step is catalyzed by the amino acid oxidase ClaO. Chromopyrrolic acid (55) formation is catalyzed by the chromopyrrolic acid synthase ClaD. The Biosynthesis\tof\tHalogenated\tAlkaloids\t \t \t \t 191 next reaction is suggested to be catalyzed in tandem by the cytochrome P450 enzyme ClaP and the flavin monooxygenase ClaC resulting in the formation of the intermediate 56 corresponding to the rebeccamycin agly-con, which only differs from this compound by the position of the chlorine N H Cl HOOC NH N H Cl N H Cl HOOC NH2 + + N H N N H Cl NH2 COOH Cl HOOC HOOC NH2 H2+ H + H + N H N H N H Cl NH2 COOH Cl HOOC NH4 + NH4 +NH N N H Cl COOH Cl HOOC H N H N N H Cl COOH Cl HOOC . .

From this \u201ccommon\u201d inter-mediate of the biosyntheses of 43 and 51\u201353/54, the pathways diverge. ClaX1, a potential flavin-dependent oxygenase, is suggested to catalyze an epoxidation reaction of the double bond between C-4c and C-7a followed by hydrolysis of the epoxide 57, either enzyme catalyzed or spontaneous. ClaX2, a second potential flavin-dependent oxygenase, is hypothesized to either catalyze epoxidation between C-7a and C-7b or hydroxylation at C-7 b suggested to lead to opening of the carbazole scaffold. Attack of the indole nitrogen at the intermediately formed keto group would lead to formation of the indenotryptoline scaffold (58) of 51\u201353 and 54 (Scheme 16).70,71 Methylation of the succinimide nitrogen is suggested to be cata-lyzed by the N-methyltransferases ClaM1 or AbeM1, respectively. O-Meth-ylation is proposed to be catalyzed by the O-methyltransferases ClaM3 or AbeM1, respectively. AbeM2, a second N-methyltransferase, is only pres-ent in BE-54017 biosynthesis and is suggested to catalyze the methylation of the indole nitrogen of the tryptoline moiety.71 Cladoniamides D\u2013G are suggested to be formed from cladoniamide A or B, respectively, through opening of the N-methylsuccinimide ring and oxidative decarboxylation.70N N N H O O CH3 OH OH CH3O R2 Cladoniamides A-C 51NH N N H O CH3 OH CH3O O R1R 1 R1 R2 Cladoniamides D-E 52N N N H O O CH3 OH OH CH3O R2 Cladoniamides F-G 53N N N O O CH3 OH OH CH3O Cl CH3 BE-54017 54Figure 10 Chemical structures of cladoniamides.

FORMATION OF NEW HALOGENATED ALKALOIDS BY PATHWAY MODIFICATIONSSanchez et al. reported on the first use of halogenases to obtain new com-pounds by introducing halogenase genes into an alkaloid-producing bacterial strain.72 The substitution of the tryptophan 7-halogenase by a tryptophan 6-and a tryptophan 5-halogenase in the biosynthesis of 43 led to formation of new bis-indole derivatives (59\u201362) (Figure 11). How-ever, a new derivative of 43 containing a chloride atom at a different posi-tion could not be obtained. When RebH, the tryptophan 7-halogenase involved in the biosynthesis of 43, was substituted by PyrH, the trypto-phan 5-halogenase from the biosynthesis of 28,53 bis-indole formation was still possible; however, RebP/RebC, the enzymes downstream of the chro-mopyrrolic acid synthase, could not cope with the chlorine atoms at posi-tions 9 and 9\u2032 of chromopyrrolic acid (59\u201360). Only the monochlorinated compound 9-chlorochromopyrrolic acid (60) could be transformed to 3-chloroarcyriaflavin A (61) by RebP/RebC. When tryptophan 6-haloge-nase was used for the substitution of the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH, only 10-chlorochromopyrrolic acid (62) was obtained indicating that the enzyme further downstream could not cope with the chlorine atom at position 10.Seibold et al. introduced the tryptophan 6-halogenase gene (thal) from S. albogriseolus, the producer of thienodolin (39), into Pseudomonas chlorora-phis, the producer of pyrrolnitrin (1).57 Overexpression of thal was so high that although the host strain still contained a tryptophan 7-halogenase N H N H HOOC COOH N H Cl Cl 9,9'-Dichlorochromopyrrolic acid 59N H N H O N H Cl O 3-Chloroarcyriaflavin A 61N H N H HOOC COOH N H Cl 9-Chlorochromopyrrolic acid 60N H N H HOOC COOH N H Cl 10-Chlorochromopyrrolic acid 62Figure 11 Compounds obtained by substituting the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH by the tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH or the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal/ThiH, respec-tively, in rebeccamycin 196\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e (PrnA), 1 was not formed anymore.

However, 63 was not accepted by the sec-ond halogenase, MCAP-3 halogenase, and thus, the biosynthesis of the analog of pyrrolnitrin (1) did not proceed further (Scheme 17).Runguphan et al. went a step further and introduced the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene rebH and the tryptophan 5-halogenase gene pyrH into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle),73 which N H COO NH3 -+  PrnA(Tryptophan 7-halogenase)FADH2, O2,Cl N H NH3 Cl COO-+  PrnB(haem enzyme)O2, compound XNH NH2Cl L-Tryptophan 27-Chloro-L-tryptophan 5Monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin 4 PrnC (Monodechloroamino-pyrrolnitrin 3-halogenase)NH NH2Cl Cl  PrnD (Aminopyrrol-nitrin oxygenase)FADH2, O2,Cl NH NO2Cl Cl  PrnB(haem enzyme)O2, compound XNH NH2 Cl 3-(2'-Amino-4'-chlorophenyl)pyrrole 63Pyrrolnitrin 1FADH2, O2,Cl  Thal/ThiH (Tryptophan 6-halogenase)Aminopyrrolnitrin 3O2, FADH2N H NH3 COO Cl -+ 6-Chloro-L-tryptophan 40 PrnC (Monodechloro-aminopyrrolnitrin 3-halogenase)FADH2, O2,Cl Scheme 17 Modification of the biosynthetic pathway of 1 using the tryptophan Biosynthesis\tof\tHalogenated\tAlkaloids\t \t \t \t 197 produces a wide variety of monoterpene indole alkaloids (Scheme 18).74 Biosynthesis of these metabolites starts with tryptophan (2) that is decar-boxylated by a tryptophan decarboxylase to tryptamine (64). 64 reacts with secologanin (65) to form strictosidine (66) that is further metabolized via several reactions to form the final products. The idea behind the work of Runguphan et al. was to start the biosynthesis with chlorotryptophan.73 Based on the availability of tryptophan 7-halogenases and a tryptophan 5-halogenase, Runguphan et al. introduced the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene rebH together with the flavin reductase gene rebF or the tryptophan 5-halogenase gene pyrH together with the flavin reductase gene rebF, respectively.73 The in vivo formed chlorotryptophans were decarboxyl-ated to the corresponding 5-or 7-chlorotryptamines (67\u201368), respectively. To ensure that the chlorotryptophans were produced in the cytosol, no signal sequences were used. The chlorinated alkaloids obtained differed depending on the regioselectivity of the tryptophan halogenase present in the plant cells. This indicates that some of the enzymes downstream of strictosidine synthase differ in their substrate specificity.The accumulation of the chlorotryptophans in the plant cells indi-cated that decarboxylation of the chlorotryptophans was a bottleneck in the biosynthesis of halogenated alkaloids by C. roseus. To overcome this bottleneck, Glenn et al. decided to reengineer RebH and thus change its substrate specificity.75 In contrast to the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA from pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis that chlorinates tryptamine derivatives in the 2-position of the indole ring,76 RebH retains its regioselectivity when chlorinating tryptamine; however, its activity with tryptamine (64) as a substrate is extremely low. To allow RebH to accept 64 as a substrate, it seemed logic to change those amino acids that are involved in binding tryptophan via its carboxylic acid and amino group. Mutant RebH Y455W showed the desired change in substrate specificity. The phenolic oxygen of Y455 was only 2.6\u00c5 away from the carboxylic acid group. By filling this space with a tryptophan residue reduces the affinity of tryptophan to the RebH Y455W mutant but still allows binding of 64. Thus, the bot-tleneck due to the low activity of the tryptophan decarboxylase from C. roseus toward 7-chlorotryptophan (5) could be overcome by moving the chlorination from tryptophan (2) to 64. When chloride was substituted in the cultivation medium by bromide, the corresponding brominated com-pounds were formed. However, iodide was not incorporated.Using a combination of molecular genetics and chemical synthe-sis, Roy et al. obtained novel derivatives of the uridyl peptide antibiotic pacidamycin (69).77 69 is produced from tryptophan (2) by Streptomyces coeruleorubidus. Introduction of the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene prnA from the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin (1) resulted in the formation of chlo-ropacidamycin (70) by S. coeruleorubidus due to efficient in situ chlorina-tion of 2 as the starting molecule. 70 was then chemically modified by 198\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e N H NH2 COOH  Tryptophandecarboxylase N H NH2 Tryptophan 2Tryptamine 64Strictosidine  synthaseO O-Glc MeO2C CHO Secologanin 65O N H NH O-Glc MeO2C N H CO2Me N H N H N O MeO2C N H CO2Me N Strictosidine 66N H Tryptophan 2 RebH (Tryptophan7-halogenase) FADH2, O2,Cl  PyrH (Tryptophan5-halogenase) FADH2, O2,Cl N H Cl 7-Chlorotryptophan 55-Chlorotryptophan 30NH2 COOH N H Cl NH2 COOH NH2 COOH N H NH2 Cl N H CO2Me H N Cl  Tryptophandecarboxylase  Tryptophandecarboxylase N H NH2Cl N H N O MeO2C Cl N H CO2Me H N N H CO2Me N HCl 7-Chlorotryptamine 5-Chlorotryptamine Scheme 18 Formation of alkaloids by Catharanthus roseus.

HALOGENATING ENZYMES INVOLVED IN ALKALOID BIOSYNTHESIS A.  Halogenation of Aromatic Rings and Aliphatic Substrates Activated for Electrophilic AttackThe first halogenating enzyme that was described to be involved in halometabolite biosynthesis was chloroperoxidase from the caldari-omycin (71) (Figure 12) producer Caldariomyces fumago.78 This enzyme was thought to be involved in caldariomycin biosynthesis on the basis that it converts \u03b2-ketoadipic acid to \u03b4-chlorolevulinic acid and that incorporation of the chlorine atom of \u03b4-chlorolevulinic acid into caldariomycin was observed.79 Cyclization of \u03b4-chlorolevulinic acid was assumed to give rise to 2-chloro-1,3-cyclopentanedione that was considered as a possible intermediate in caldariomycin biosynthesis. It has to be noted that chloroperoxidase also catalyzes the chlorination of 1,3-cyclopentandione.80 Chloroperoxidase is a heme enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of the halide ions iodide, bromide, and chloride in the presence of hydrogen peroxide leading to the formation of free hypohalous acids. This free hypohalous acid then leads to nonspecific halogenation of electron-rich substrates.81 Thus, the chloroperoxidase-initiated halogenation reactions proceed with lack of substrate specificity and regioselectivity. After the detection of chloroperoxidase from C. fumago, a large number of chloro-and bromoperoxidases from many different organisms have been detected and characterized. In addition to heme-containing haloperoxidases, vanadium-containing haloperoxidases were isolated from various organ-isms.82 However, due to the discrepancy between the lack of regioselectiv-ity and the chemical structure of the halometabolites isolated, there was some doubt about the involvement of haloperoxidases in halometabolite biosynthesis, especially with genetic proof such as cloning of the caldari-omycin biosynthetic gene cluster and disruption of the chloroperoxidase gene in the caldariomycin producer still being missing.83This situation lasted until 1995, when Dairi et al. cloned the 7-chlorotetracycline biosynthetic gene cluster and identified the gene for the halogenating enzyme.18 This gene and the corresponding enzyme showed no sequence similarity to any of the known haloperoxidases. OH OH Cl Cl Caldariomycin 71Figure 12 Chemical structure of caldariomycin Biosynthesis\tof\tHalogenated\tAlkaloids\t \t \t \t 201 However, neither expression of the gene nor any in vitro studies were performed. Two years later, Hammer et al. reported on the isolation and characterization of a biosynthetic gene cluster of pyrrolnitrin (1) where they also found a gene with high similarity to the 7-chlorotetracycline halogenase.14 The corresponding enzyme was subsequently identified as MCAP-3 halogenase, the second halogenase in the biosynthetic pathway of 1.19 However, a close inspection of the amino acid sequence showed that about 100 amino acids and thus a nucleotide-binding motif (GxGxxG) were missing in the 7-chlorotetracycline halogenase.14 Interestingly, this motif was also present in the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA shown to catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of 1, although PrnA shows no overall sequence similarity to the 7-chlorotetracycline and the MCAP-3 halogenase. During purification of PrnA and MCAP-3 halogenase, it was detected that a flavin reductase as a second enzyme component was required.84 This flavin reductase produces FADH2 from FAD and NAD(P)H. The detection of FADH2-dependent halogenases had an enormous impact on the understanding of enzymatic halogenation and the detection of gene clusters for halometabolite biosynthesis. In the mean time, a large number of such gene clusters has been isolated and characterized.85,86 All the gene clusters that are involved in the biosynthesis of halogenated phe-nols or pyrroles or other activated aromatic rings or electron-rich aliphatic compounds have been found to contain FADH2-dependent halogenases. However, in vitro activity has only been demonstrated for a few of these halogenases. This is due to lack of knowledge concerning the natural sub-strate and/or lack of its availability.Thus, most information exists about the tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA and RebH. PrnA was the first FADH2-dependent halogenase to be purified and characterized.84 The elucidation of its three-dimensional structure revealed that the purified enzyme does not contain flavin but contains a single chloride ion.15 This chloride ion is bound close to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (Figures 13 and 14),87 which was introduced into the crystals by soaking them in an FAD solution. Complexes of the enzyme with its substrate tryptophan (2) and also with its reaction prod-uct 7-chlorotryptophan (5) showed that they were bound at a distance of about 10\u00c5 away from the isoalloxazine ring preventing direct contact between them. Thus, a diffusible halogenating agent must be formed at the active site to bridge the distance between the isoalloxazine ring and the substrate. This diffusible compound is hypochlorous or hypobromous acid, when bromide is present.The first step is the binding of FADH2, in an in vitro system produced either by a flavin reductase or, chemically,26 by the halogenase. Then, in analogy to the reaction of flavin-dependent monooxygenases, FADH2 reacts with oxygen to form a flavin hydroperoxide. This flavin hydroper-oxide is attacked by the nearby bound chloride or bromide ion resulting 202\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e Figure 13 Ribbon model of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA. The enzyme consists Biosynthesis\tof\tHalogenated\tAlkaloids\t \t \t \t 203 in the formation of hypohalous acid and hydroxyflavin (Scheme 20). In contrast to the situation in haloperoxidases, this hypohalous acid cannot leave the active site15 but is guided along the 10\u00c5 tunnel toward the sub-strate. Interaction with a lysine and a glutamate residue that are essential for activity ensures correct positioning of the halide species to attack the aromatic ring (Figure 14). Deprotonation of the Wheland intermediate 72 leads to the chlorinated final product (Scheme 21).The regiospecificity of the reaction is determined by the binding of the substrate.17 While all the amino acids required for activity are in the same position in tryptophan halogenases with different regioselectivities, it is the substrate that is turned around in such a way that the position to be halogenated overlaps in halogenases with different regioselectivities (Figure 15).Changing the regioselectivity is possible by modifying the amino acids keeping the substrate in a highly fixed position and thus creating space around the substrate that allows for some movements and the presenta-tion of a different position toward the chlorine species interacting with the lysine and the glutamate residues (Figure 16). B.  Halogenation of Nonactivated Carbon AtomsThe detection of FADH2-dependent halogenases had led to the under-standing of how halogenation of substrates activated for the reaction with an electrophilic halide species proceeds but did not explain how nonactivated carbon atoms such as methyl groups can be halogenated N N NH N O O R NADH + HNAD N H N NH N H R O O N H N NH O O R N H N H N NH O O R N O O H O2 N H N NH O O R N O H Cl HOCl + FADH2                             Flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide                 C(4a)-hydroxyflavin + + Flavin reductaseFAD FADH2 PrnA Scheme 20 Formation of FADH2 by a flavin reductase and formation of hypochlorous 204\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e in an enzymatic reaction. This riddle was solved by the work of Vaillan-court et al.89 They detected a type of halogenating enzymes showing some similarity to nonheme iron, \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. The elucidation of the structure of the nonheme iron, \u03b1-ketoglutarate-and O2-dependent halogenase SyrB2 that chlorinates l-threonine in syringomycin biosynthesis, indicated that the reaction proceeds via the formation of a substrate radical by H atom abstraction.90 The substrate radical then reacts with the chloride ion to form the chlorinated product (Scheme 22).Vaillancourt et al. found that such a reaction is involved in the for-mation of a cyclopropane ring as a cryptic chlorination reaction, where chloride serves as a leaving group.88 Analogously, a cyclopropane ring is formed during the biosynthesis of kutznerides.47Lys79 N H HH Glu346 CO OH Lys79 N H H H Glu346 CO OH Lys79 N H H H OH2 CO OH Lys79 N H H H OH2 Tryptophan 2 7-Chlorotryptophan 5Glu346 Glu346 -++ + + NHCH2 H3N COO -+ H Cl NHCH2 H3N COO + -+ NHCH2 H3N COO Cl -+ Cl NH C H2 NH3 COO -+ O HCl C OH O H O Wheland intermediate 72 7-Chlorotryptophan 5Scheme 21 Reaction mechanism of FADH2-dependent halogenases showing the involvement of the two absolutely required amino acid residues lysine79 and gluta-mate346 in the formation of 6 by the tryptophan 7-halogenase Biosynthesis\tof\tHalogenated\tAlkaloids\t \t \t \t 205 Figure 15 Overlay of the active sites of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA and the 206\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e VII. CONCLUSIONSFrom the examples shown above for the biosynthetic pathways of haloge-nated alkaloids, it can be seen that a lot of knowledge has been obtained by molecular genetic investigations. The cloning of gene clusters has led to the suggestion of possible pathways, but in many cases, the sequence of the individual steps is still unclear or there are still gaps in the pathways or discrepancies between the genes found and the enzymatic reactions expected to be necessary to obtain the final product. This is mostly due to the fact that biochemical investigations of the individual steps are very often lacking. Only in a few cases, individual enzymes have been identi-fied and the activity has been investigated in vitro. This is mostly due to a lack of the substrates for these enzymes and knowledge about their cofac-tor requirements. To fill these gaps, the creation of mutants in the path-ways allowing the accumulation and isolation of intermediates is required.

Overexpression is very often required since the activities of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism are often rather low making character-ization of these enzymes in vitro very difficult. Thus, there is still a lot of work to do to fully understand the biosynthetic pathway of halogenated alkaloids. For the application of enzymes from secondary metabolism for the production of interesting products, the biochemical characterization is a prerequisite. As an alternative, however, the enzymes can be used in in vivo systems by integrating them into existing biosynthetic pathways and thus modifying these pathways.It will be interesting to see whether halogenating enzymes different from the ones known to date will be discovered and how enzymatic halo-genations will be applied in in vitro or in vivo systems in the future to obtain new alkaloid derivatives and other compounds with interesting biological activities and properties.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank Prof. James Naismith and his group for an excellent collaboration.

        "INTRODUCTIONThe knowledge about enzymatic halogenation has increased enormously during the last 15 years. The identification of FADH2-dependent haloge-nases and nonheme iron, \u03b1-ketoglutarate-and O2-dependent halogenases, the two types of halogenating enzymes shown to be involved in the bio-synthesis of halogenated metabolites, has also contributed substantially to the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters of halometabolites. Whereas the cloning, sequencing, and the construction of mutants in specific genes of these gene clusters have made the characterization of the biosyntheses of halometabolites on a genetic basis much easier, biochemical character-ization, such as analyses of in vitro activity of enzymes involved in these biosynthetic pathways, is still lacking behind. This is mostly due to the problem of identifying the natural substrates of these enzymes and the availability of these substrates.In this review, examples for the biosynthesis of halogenated alkaloids, derived from different precursor molecules, will be shown, illustrating the various degrees of knowledge about the pathways and the enzymatic reactions",

        "PYRROLES A. PyrrolnitrinPyrrolnitrin (1) [3-chloro-4-(2\u2032-nitro-3\u2032-chlorophenyl)pyrrole; Figure 1] was isolated in 19641 as an antibiotic showing activity against fungi, yeast, and Gram-positive bacteria2 from Pseudomonas pyrrocinia. Later, 1 was found to be produced by a large variety of different bacteria such as Pseudomonas species, Burkholderia cepacia strains, Myxococcus fulvus, Cor-allococcus exiguous, Cystobacter ferrugineus, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Serratia.3,4 The antibiotic activity of 1 is mainly due to inhibition of glyc-erol kinase leading to accumulation of glycerol and thus leaky cell mem-branes.5 Early investigations into the biosynthesis of 1 by Lively et al. showed that 1 was derived from the aromatic amino acid tryptophan (2).6",

        "Detailed studies using multiple-labeled 2 showed that the indole nitro-gen gives rise to the nitro group nitrogen, whereas the nitrogen of the amino group was incorporated into the pyrrole ring. All carbon atoms with the exception of the carboxylic acid group were incorporated into 1.7 However, the question whether the d-or the l-enantiomer of 2 was the starting point for the biosynthesis of 1 could not be answered, although the d-enantiomer of 2 seemed more likely since addition of the d-enan-tiomer of 2 resulted in enhanced production of 1.8 The isolation of ami-nopyrrolnitrin (3) led to the conclusion that the oxidation of the amino to the nitro group was the last step in the biosynthesis of 1.9 2-Carboxy-4-(2\u2032-amino-3\u2032-chlorophenyl)pyrrole was isolated by Salcher et al.10, and monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin (4) could be obtained by incubation of 1-producing Pseudomonas species under chloride-limiting conditions in the presence of 7-chlorotryptophan (5), suggesting the chlorination of 2 to be the first step in the biosynthesis of 1.11 Furthermore, the isolation of carboxy-4-(2\u2032-amino-3\u2032-chlorophenyl)pyrrole and monodechloroami-nopyrrolnitrin (5) suggested the ring rearrangement to occur before the second chlorination",
        "step.First attempts to isolate the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 from Pseu-domonas fluorescens led to the detection of a global regulator required for the formation of chitinase, cyanide, and pyrrolnitrin by P. fluorescens.12,13 Employment of this regulator to complement a wild-type P. fluorescens strain lacking this global regulator to induce the formation of 1 allowed the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1.14 The genes prnA\u2013D were identified as being sufficient to allow pyrrolnitrin production in Escherichia coli. Detailed analysis into the function of the corresponding enzymes PrnA\u2013D via the construction of individual mutants revealed that PrnA was a tryptophan 7-halogenase that showed no obvious sequence similarity to any enzyme known until that date. Detailed analysis of PrnA revealed that this enzyme is a flavin-dependent halogenase requiring FADH2 and oxygen for its chlorinating activity. Isolated PrnA does not contain flavin. FADH2 is produced by a flavin reductase and is then bound by the halogenase where it reacts with oxygen to form a flavin hydro-peroxide in a reaction similar to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. This flavin hydroperoxide is attacked by a chloride ion bound close to the iso-alloxazine ring of flavin leading to the formation of hypochlorous acid. This hypochlorous acid cannot leave the active site but diffuses toward the substrate that is bound about 10\u00c5 away from the flavin.15 A more detailed description of the mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases can be found below (Section",
        "VI.A.).PrnB was identified as the enzyme catalyzing the rearrangement of tryptophan (2) into a phenylpyrrole derivative. PrnB is a heme-containing dioxygenase that shows high structural similarity to trypto-phan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).16,17",
        "170\t \t \t \t Karl-Heinz\tvan\tP\u00e9e",
        "However, albeit the high structural similarity between the enzymes, the product of the reaction catalyzed by PrnB is quite different from that of the reaction catalyzed by TDO and IDO. TDO and IDO catalyze the formation of N-formylkynurenine (6), thus cleaving the indole ring between C-2 and C-3 by introducing two oxygen atoms (Scheme 1). PrnB cleaves the indole ring between the indole ring nitrogen and C-2 of the indole ring. Concomitant formation of a new pyrrole ring by attack of the amino group of tryptophan at C-2 of the indole ring leads to the formation of the aminophenylpyrrole derivative monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin (4). It is suggested that the indole ring is opened by the incorporation of oxygen; however, the two oxy-gen atoms are lost during formation of the pyrrole ring as is the carboxyl group of 2. Thus, only a very early common intermediate of the reactions catalyzed by TDO, IDO, and PrnB is possible from which the TDO/IDO-catalyzed reaction diverges from that catalyzed by PrnB (Scheme 1).16,17 Structural analysis of PrnB in complex with the d-and the l-enantiomers of 2 and the d-and l-enantiomers of 5 have shown that only the binding of the l-enantiomers leads to productive binding of the substrate. Thus, only the l-enantiomer of 5 can be used as the starting point for the biosynthesis of 1.PrnC was shown to catalyze the regioselective chlorination of the phenylpyrrole derivative 4 formed by the action of PrnB. PrnC has high sequence homology to the halogenating enzyme involved in 7-chlorotetracycline biosynthesis.14,18 The final step in the biosynthesis of 1 is catalyzed by aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase (PrnD). PrnD was identi-fied as the enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of the amino group of 3 to the nitro group of 1.19 PrnD is a Rieske N-oxygenase that requires reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) formed by a flavin reductase.20,21 PrnD has a rather broad substrate specificity. It accepts a variety of not only aminophenylpyrrole derivatives22 but also p-aminobenzylamine, p-ami-nobenzyl alcohol, and p-aminophenylalanine.20 The data obtained from feeding experiments, isolation of intermediates, and the molecular genetic data resulted in the biosynthetic pathway shown in Scheme",
        "2.The isolation of derivatives of 1 chlorinated at different positions or lacking chlorine atoms at specific positions can be explained by the less strict substrate specificity or regioselectivity of PrnC, the second haloge-nase involved in pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis compared to the very high substrate specificity and regioselectivity of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA. No derivative of 1 has been isolated with a chlorine atom at the phenyl ring at a position differing from the 7-position of the indole ring. However, isopyrrolnitrin (7) lacks the chlorine atom at the phenyl ring but contains two chlorine atoms at positions 2 and 3 of the pyrrole ring (Scheme 2).23Whereas PrnA accepts the l-as well as the d-enantiomer of 2 as a sub-strate,3 PrnB, the second enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, can only use the l-enantiomer. However, PrnB accepts the l-enantiomer of tryptophan",

        "(2) as well as the l-enantiomer of 7-chlorotryptophan (5). The formation of isopyrrolnitrin (7) could be explained by the reaction of PrnB on 2 fol-lowed by dichlorination of 3-(2-aminophenyl)pyrrole (8) to isoaminopyr-rolnitrin (9) by the second halogenase PrnC followed by oxidation of the amino group catalyzed by PrnC (Scheme",

Since a flavin reductase gene (prnF) was found very close to the four genes (prnA\u2013D) considered to consti-tute the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic gene cluster, prnF was suggested to be part of the cluster.25 However, PrnF can be substituted by a variety of flavin reductases in the halogenase reaction26\u201329 as well as in the ami-nopyrrolnitrin oxygenase system,20 and no specific interaction between the halogenases and aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase with the reductases seems to be required.

Feeding studies using [1,2-13C2]acetate showed that the resorcinol moiety of 10 is formed via polyketide biosynthe-sis,33 whereas the pyrrole ring was found to originate from proline (11).34 A genomic region required for the biosynthesis of 10 was identified in P. fluorescens Pf-5, the producer of 10.35 Nowak-Thompson et al. reported on the isolation of two polyketide synthase (PKS) genes required for the biosynthesis of 10.36 These PKS genes showed high similarity to type I PKS genes. In 1999, the complete biosynthetic gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 10 was characterized.34 The cluster contains 10 genes (pltA\u2013G, pltL\u2013M, and pltR) within a 24-kb genomic region. Eight of these genes (pltA\u2013G and pltM) were suggested to be directly involved in the biosynthesis of 10. Individual destruction of each of these genes resulted in loss of the pro-duction of 10. pltR was proposed to function as a transcriptional activator. At first, no function could be suggested for pltL. However, later PltL was identified as a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) required for the binding of 11 after activation by the prolyl-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) ligase PltF.37 pltB and pltC showed high homology to type I polyketide biosyn-thetic genes, whereas pltA, pltD, and pltM showed homology to FADH2-dependent halogenases. However, in PltD, the two regions found in all flavin-dependent halogenases, the nucleotide-binding site (GxGxxG) and a motif containing two tryptophan residues (WxWxIP), were not strictly conserved, suggesting that PltD does not function as a halogenase.

The biosynthesis starts with 11 that is acti-vated by the prolyl-AMP ligase PltF and transferred onto the PCP PltL. PltL-tethered 11 is then dehydrogenated by the flavin-dependent dehy-drogenase PrnE. Whether PrnE catalyzes only the introduction of the first double bond followed by spontaneous formation of the second double bond in the presence of oxygen or whether PltE catalyzes the formation of both double bonds is not known. Dorrestein et al. showed that PltL-bound pyrrole carboxylic acid 13 can be dichlorinated by the FADH2-dependent halogenase PltA.28 Whether PltA also catalyzes the incorporation of both chlorine atoms of pyoluteorin in vivo or whether one is incorporated via the action of the second FADH2-dependent haloge-nase PltM has not been investigated.

        "C. PyrrolomycinsPyrrolomycins (16) (Figure 3) are structurally closely related to 10 (Figure 2). Some of the pyrrolomycins contain a nitro group (pyrrolomycin A, B, G, H and dioxapyrrolomycin). In contrast to 10, they all contain, with the exception of pyrrolomycin A (16A), two chlorine atoms at the phenyl ring. Feeding experiments have shown that labeled acetate is incorporated into the phenyl ring but not into the pyrrole ring. Feeding of 15N-labeled 11 resulted in 16 labeled in the pyrrole ring nitrogen only but not in the nitro group. The nitro group, however, was labeled when a Na15NO3-enriched medium was used.38 This clearly points toward a biosynthetic pathway very similar to that of 10 with the phenyl ring being formed via polyketide biosynthesis and the pyrrole ring via NRPs. In contrast to the biosynthesis of 1 during which the nitro group is formed by oxidation of an amino group, biosynthesis of 16 would employ a nitration reaction as known from the formation of the 4-nitro-tryptophan moiety of the thaxomins.39Zhang and Parry cloned the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 16 from Actinosporangium vitaminophilum.40 The polyketide synthase Pyr25 consists of two modules, and the polyketide synthase Pyr24 consists of one module. This is identical to the situation in the biosynthesis of 10. Interestingly, mod-ule 2 of Pyr25 contains a ketoreductase gene that was suggested to be non-functional in the biosynthesis of 10. The presence of a ketoreductase gene in a polyketide synthase in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 10 as well as in the biosynthetic gene cluster of 16 suggests that it might actually be required for the biosyntheses of 10 and 16. However, module 3 does not contain a dehydratase gene that is present in the corresponding polyketide synthase module from the biosynthesis of 10 but was also suggested to be inactive.

On the other hand, the domains contained in the three modules are not quite sufficient to fully explain the formation of the phenyl ring since the dihydroxycyclohexanone intermedi-ate 17 formed via the activity of the thioesterase Pyr26 needs to be dehydrated twice to give the phenol ring of 16. It is suggested that these dehydration reactions could occur spontaneously. There is no information concerning the reduction of the keto group to the methylene group of the pyrrolomycins.Due to the high similarity of the cloned halogenase genes from A. vitaminophilum, the producer of 16, with those from P. fluorescens Pf-5, the producer of 10, it can be assumed that one FADH2-dependent haloge-nase (Pyr29) catalyzes the chlorination of the PCP-bound pyrrole carboxylic acid 18 at positions 2 and 3; however, no experimental data to support this assumption have been presented so far. Although some of the pyrrolomycins contain five chlorine atoms, only two additional genes for FADH2-dependent halogenases have been detected. Interestingly, a gene with an overall homol-ogy to genes of FADH2-dependent halogenases, but lacking the conserved nucleotide-binding site motif like PltD from the biosynthesis of 10, was found in the cluster. The function of the corresponding enzyme is not known, yet. A flavin reductase gene (pyr9) was also found in the cluster. The role of Pyr9 could be to produce FADH2 for the FADH2-dependent halogenases.

All derivatives of 23 contain a dichlorinated pyrroloindole derivative, and kutznerides 4 and 8 contain an additional chlorine atom at the 1,2-diazacyclohexane moiety of 23. Whereas the incorporation of the two chlorine atoms into the pyrroloindole moiety was assumed to be catalyzed by FADH2-dependent halogenases, incorporation of the chlo-rine atom into the 1,2-diazacyclohexane moiety was most likely catalyzed by a nonheme iron, O2-and \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenase. Such an enzyme was also hypothesized to be involved in the formation of the cyclopropyl moiety (24) of 23.47 Thus, degenerate primers for these two types of halogenases could be successfully employed in the screening of a cosmid library of the producer of 23. The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 23 consists of 29 open reading frames (ORFs). For 17 of these ORFs, roles in the biosynthesis of 23 have been assigned. Biosynthesis of 23 is suggested to start with l-isoleucine 25, which is transferred onto the PCP KtzC. This KtzC-tethered 25 is then chlorinated at the terminal methyl group by KtzD, a nonheme iron halogenase. This chlorination reaction is cryptic since the chlorine atom serves as a leaving group allowing the formation of the cyclopropyl ring catalyzed by the dehydrogenase KtzA. Subsequent hydrolysis of the thioester bond catalyzed by KtzF results in the formation of free 2-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-l-glycine (l-MecPGly) 24 (Scheme 8), which is then loaded onto the nonribosomal peptide synthe-tase KtzE. The next NRPS (KtzE) is suggested to be responsible for the isomerization of 24 to its d-enantiomer. The next NRPS, KtzG, is suggested to be responsible for the formation of the \u03b2-branched \u03b1-hydroxy acid",

        "KtzI.Chlorination of the 1,2-diazacyclohexane derivative was shown by Jiang et al. to be catalyzed by a second nonheme iron halogenase (KthP) whose gene was found outside of the cluster.48 KthP only accepts the (3S)-1,2-diazacyclohexane residue bound to a thiolation domain (26) but not the (3R) epimer. Interestingly, only the 1,2-diaza-3S,5S-5-chlorocyclohex-ane derivative (27) is formed and not the 3S,5R stereoisomer found in the mature kutznerides suggesting further processing of 27 (Scheme 9).KtzH, a four-module NRPS consisting of 5260 amino acids, is suggested to catalyze the incorporation of the remaining four amino acid residues (piperazate3-O-Me-Ser4-3-OH-Glu5-diClPIC6). The tricyclic dichlo rinated pyrroloindole moiety is derived from tryptophan (2) that is dichlorinated as a free substrate by the tandem action of the two FADH2-dependent halogenases KtzQ and KtzR. From enzyme kinetic studies of the KtzQ-and KtzR-catalyzed chlorination of tryptophan (2), it was concluded that KtzQ catalyzes the first chlorination at position 7 of the indole ring fol-lowed by chlorination of the 6-position catalyzed by KtzR.49 The forma-tion of the unusual tricyclic pyrroloindole ring that can also be found in pyrroindomycins A and B (28, Figure 7)50 is suggested to be catalyzed by KtzM.

        "spirotetronate moiety of chlorotrycin, 28 contains a spirotetramate  moiety. The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 28 was detected by screening of a cosmid library of Streptomyces rugosporus, the producer of 28, using PCR primers derived from the conserved sequences of FADH2-dependent halogenases.53 PyrH, the halogenase detected during this screening, was identified as an FADH2-dependent, regioselective tryptophan 5-haloge-nase. Analysis of a gene disruption mutant in the tryptophan 5-haloge-nase gene showed that this mutant only produced the nonchlorinated derivative of 28. Chlorination of 2 in the 5-position was thus shown to be the first step in the biosynthesis of 28 (Scheme 11).Nothing is known yet about the formation of the tricyclic indolopyrrole moiety 31, although a similarity to the tricyclic hexahydropyrroloindole moiety of kutznerides (23) and the proposed intermediate in the ring rear-rangement reaction in the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin (1) seems quite likely. However, whereas during the biosynthesis of 1 the carboxylic acid group of tryptophan (2) is lost, in the biosyntheses of 23 and 28, it is used to connect the tricyclic ring system via a peptide or an ester bond, respectively, to other parts of the molecule. In the case of 28, the indolopyrrole moiety is con-nected to the polyketide moiety via a trisaccharide moiety.

It could be shown that Thal/ThiH was an FADH2-dependent tryptophan halogenase that catalyzes the regioselective chlorination and bromination of the l-and d-enantiomers of tryptophan (2). The haloge-nase gene was used for the screening of a cosmid library of S. albogriseolus leading to the detection and isolation of the biosynthetic gene cluster of 39. The construction of gene disruption mutants of S. albogriseolus showed that Thal catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of 39. Without Thal, and thus no formation of 6-chlorotryptophan (40), biosynthesis of 39 can-not proceed. The disruption of an amido transferase gene (thiD) revealed that formation of the amide group of 39 was the last step in the biosyn-thesis of 39. In vitro analysis of the amido transferase ThiD showed that it requires ATP for the transfer of an amino group onto its substrate 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylate (41).58The incorporation of the sulfur atom into 39 is still a mystery. None of the genes detected in the cluster show any similarity to genes known to code for sulfur-transferring enzymes.

To verify that the isolated cosmids contained genes of the gene cluster for biosynthesis of 43, these cosmids were subjected to PCR analysis with degenerate primers for FADH2-dependent halogenases.62 Further analysis of cosmids containing the N-glycosyltransferase as well as the halogenase gene allowed the isolation and sequencing of the complete gene cluster for the biosynthesis of 43.63The first step in rebeccamycin biosynthesis is the regioselective chlo-rination of tryptophan (2) by the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH. FADH2 required by RebH might be provided by the flavin reductase RebF.

Although this l-amino oxidase also accepts 2 as a substrate, its catalytic efficiency with 5 is about 57 times higher than that with 2 as the sub-strate.64 The next step is suggested to be catalyzed by the chromopyrrolic acid synthase RebD. RebD has 54% sequence identity to the analogous enzyme (StaD) from staurosporine biosynthesis. A rebD-disruption mutant did not produce any indolocarbazole-related compound. In the reaction catalyzed by RebD, 44 produced in the RebO reaction is suggested to react with a second molecule of 5 to form 11,11\u2032-dichlorochromopyr-rolic acid (45).65 Nishizawa et al. and Howard-Jones and Walsh suggest that 44 should react with 7-chloroindole-3-pyruvate imine (7-chlorode-hydrotryptophan, 46) that is proposed to be an intermediate in the RebO-catalyzed reaction.64,66 The mechanism for the RebD-catalyzed reaction",

        "leading to the formation of the bis-indole core of 43 as proposed by How-ard-Jones and Walsh66 is shown in Scheme 14. The formation of the bis-indole core starts with the condensation of a 7-chloroindole-3-pyruvate imine (46) with its corresponding enamine tautomeric form (47) to yield the intermediate 48. This intermediate is favored as a substrate for the following oxidative coupling step by Howard-Jones and Walsh66 due to the inherent stability of its highly conjugated skeleton and its ability to participate in one-electron oxidation involving hydrogen abstraction. Abstraction of a hydrogen radical is suggested to lead to formation of 49 allowing formation of the pyrrolic C-3 to C-4 bond, and abstraction of a second hydrogen radical followed by tautomerization would yield the dicarboxypyrrole 45.It is proposed that 45 is oxidized by RebP followed by an oxida-tion at C-7 by RebC to give the rebeccamycin aglycon 50. The final two steps would be the glycosylation at N-12 with glucose catalyzed by the N-glycosyltransferase RebG followed by methylation of the glucose by RebM that uses S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl group donor63 (Scheme",

The idea behind the work of Runguphan et al. was to start the biosynthesis with chlorotryptophan.73 Based on the availability of tryptophan 7-halogenases and a tryptophan 5-halogenase, Runguphan et al. introduced the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene rebH together with the flavin reductase gene rebF or the tryptophan 5-halogenase gene pyrH together with the flavin reductase gene rebF, respectively.73 The in vivo formed chlorotryptophans were decarboxyl-ated to the corresponding 5-or 7-chlorotryptamines (67\u201368), respectively. To ensure that the chlorotryptophans were produced in the cytosol, no signal sequences were used. The chlorinated alkaloids obtained differed depending on the regioselectivity of the tryptophan halogenase present in the plant cells. This indicates that some of the enzymes downstream of strictosidine synthase differ in their substrate",
        "specificity.The accumulation of the chlorotryptophans in the plant cells indi-cated that decarboxylation of the chlorotryptophans was a bottleneck in the biosynthesis of halogenated alkaloids by C. roseus. To overcome this bottleneck, Glenn et al. decided to reengineer RebH and thus change its substrate specificity.75 In contrast to the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA from pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis that chlorinates tryptamine derivatives in the 2-position of the indole ring,76 RebH retains its regioselectivity when chlorinating tryptamine; however, its activity with tryptamine (64) as a substrate is extremely low. To allow RebH to accept 64 as a substrate, it seemed logic to change those amino acids that are involved in binding tryptophan via its carboxylic acid and amino group. Mutant RebH Y455W showed the desired change in substrate specificity. The phenolic oxygen of Y455 was only 2.6\u00c5 away from the carboxylic acid group. By filling this space with a tryptophan residue reduces the affinity of tryptophan to the RebH Y455W mutant but still allows binding of 64. Thus, the bot-tleneck due to the low activity of the tryptophan decarboxylase from C. roseus toward 7-chlorotryptophan (5) could be overcome by moving the chlorination from tryptophan (2) to 64. When chloride was substituted in the cultivation medium by bromide, the corresponding brominated com-pounds were formed. However, iodide was not incorporated.Using a combination of molecular genetics and chemical synthe-sis, Roy et al. obtained novel derivatives of the uridyl peptide antibiotic pacidamycin (69).77 69 is produced from tryptophan (2) by Streptomyces coeruleorubidus. Introduction of the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene prnA from the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin (1) resulted in the formation of chlo-ropacidamycin (70) by S. coeruleorubidus due to efficient in situ chlorina-tion of 2 as the starting molecule. 70 was then chemically modified by",

        "VI.  HALOGENATING ENZYMES INVOLVED IN ALKALOID",
        "BIOSYNTHESIS A.  Halogenation of Aromatic Rings and Aliphatic Substrates Activated for Electrophilic AttackThe first halogenating enzyme that was described to be involved in halometabolite biosynthesis was chloroperoxidase from the caldari-omycin (71) (Figure 12) producer Caldariomyces fumago.78 This enzyme was thought to be involved in caldariomycin biosynthesis on the basis that it converts \u03b2-ketoadipic acid to \u03b4-chlorolevulinic acid and that incorporation of the chlorine atom of \u03b4-chlorolevulinic acid into caldariomycin was observed.79 Cyclization of \u03b4-chlorolevulinic acid was assumed to give rise to 2-chloro-1,3-cyclopentanedione that was considered as a possible intermediate in caldariomycin biosynthesis. It has to be noted that chloroperoxidase also catalyzes the chlorination of 1,3-cyclopentandione.80 Chloroperoxidase is a heme enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of the halide ions iodide, bromide, and chloride in the presence of hydrogen peroxide leading to the formation of free hypohalous acids. This free hypohalous acid then leads to nonspecific halogenation of electron-rich substrates.81 Thus, the chloroperoxidase-initiated halogenation reactions proceed with lack of substrate specificity and regioselectivity. After the detection of chloroperoxidase from C. fumago, a large number of chloro-and bromoperoxidases from many different organisms have been detected and characterized. In addition to heme-containing haloperoxidases, vanadium-containing haloperoxidases were isolated from various organ-isms.82 However, due to the discrepancy between the lack of regioselectiv-ity and the chemical structure of the halometabolites isolated, there was some doubt about the involvement of haloperoxidases in halometabolite biosynthesis, especially with genetic proof such as cloning of the caldari-omycin biosynthetic gene cluster and disruption of the chloroperoxidase gene in the caldariomycin producer still being missing.83This situation lasted until 1995, when Dairi et al. cloned the 7-chlorotetracycline biosynthetic gene cluster and identified the gene for the halogenating enzyme.18 This gene and the corresponding enzyme showed no sequence similarity to any of the known haloperoxidases.",

        "However, neither expression of the gene nor any in vitro studies were performed. Two years later, Hammer et al. reported on the isolation and characterization of a biosynthetic gene cluster of pyrrolnitrin (1) where they also found a gene with high similarity to the 7-chlorotetracycline halogenase.14 The corresponding enzyme was subsequently identified as MCAP-3 halogenase, the second halogenase in the biosynthetic pathway of 1.19 However, a close inspection of the amino acid sequence showed that about 100 amino acids and thus a nucleotide-binding motif (GxGxxG) were missing in the 7-chlorotetracycline halogenase.14 Interestingly, this motif was also present in the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA shown to catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of 1, although PrnA shows no overall sequence similarity to the 7-chlorotetracycline and the MCAP-3 halogenase. During purification of PrnA and MCAP-3 halogenase, it was detected that a flavin reductase as a second enzyme component was required.84 This flavin reductase produces FADH2 from FAD and NAD(P)H. The detection of FADH2-dependent halogenases had an enormous impact on the understanding of enzymatic halogenation and the detection of gene clusters for halometabolite biosynthesis. In the mean time, a large number of such gene clusters has been isolated and characterized.85,86 All the gene clusters that are involved in the biosynthesis of halogenated phe-nols or pyrroles or other activated aromatic rings or electron-rich aliphatic compounds have been found to contain FADH2-dependent halogenases. However, in vitro activity has only been demonstrated for a few of these halogenases. This is due to lack of knowledge concerning the natural sub-strate and/or lack of its availability.Thus, most information exists about the tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA and RebH. PrnA was the first FADH2-dependent halogenase to be purified and characterized.84 The elucidation of its three-dimensional structure revealed that the purified enzyme does not contain flavin but contains a single chloride ion.15 This chloride ion is bound close to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (Figures 13 and 14),87 which was introduced into the crystals by soaking them in an FAD solution. Complexes of the enzyme with its substrate tryptophan (2) and also with its reaction prod-uct 7-chlorotryptophan (5) showed that they were bound at a distance of about 10\u00c5 away from the isoalloxazine ring preventing direct contact between them. Thus, a diffusible halogenating agent must be formed at the active site to bridge the distance between the isoalloxazine ring and the substrate. This diffusible compound is hypochlorous or hypobromous acid, when bromide is present.The first step is the binding of FADH2, in an in vitro system produced either by a flavin reductase or, chemically,26 by the halogenase. Then, in analogy to the reaction of flavin-dependent monooxygenases, FADH2 reacts with oxygen to form a flavin hydroperoxide. This flavin hydroper-oxide is attacked by the nearby bound chloride or bromide ion resulting",

In contrast to the situation in haloperoxidases, this hypohalous acid cannot leave the active site15 but is guided along the 10\u00c5 tunnel toward the sub-strate. Interaction with a lysine and a glutamate residue that are essential for activity ensures correct positioning of the halide species to attack the aromatic ring (Figure 14). Deprotonation of the Wheland intermediate 72 leads to the chlorinated final product (Scheme",
        "21).The regiospecificity of the reaction is determined by the binding of the substrate.17 While all the amino acids required for activity are in the same position in tryptophan halogenases with different regioselectivities, it is the substrate that is turned around in such a way that the position to be halogenated overlaps in halogenases with different regioselectivities (Figure",
        "15).Changing the regioselectivity is possible by modifying the amino acids keeping the substrate in a highly fixed position and thus creating space around the substrate that allows for some movements and the presenta-tion of a different position toward the chlorine species interacting with the lysine and the glutamate residues (Figure",

The cloning of gene clusters has led to the suggestion of possible pathways, but in many cases, the sequence of the individual steps is still unclear or there are still gaps in the pathways or discrepancies between the genes found and the enzymatic reactions expected to be necessary to obtain the final product. This is mostly due to the fact that biochemical investigations of the individual steps are very often lacking. Only in a few cases, individual enzymes have been identi-fied and the activity has been investigated in vitro. This is mostly due to a lack of the substrates for these enzymes and knowledge about their cofac-tor requirements. To fill these gaps, the creation of mutants in the path-ways allowing the accumulation and isolation of intermediates is required. These intermediates could then serve as substrates for enzymatic reactions",
