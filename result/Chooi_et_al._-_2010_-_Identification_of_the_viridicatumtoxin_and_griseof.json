Here, we report the concurrent discovery of the two corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (vrt and gsf) by 454 shotgun sequencing. Gene deletions confirmed that two nonreducing PKSs (NRPKSs), vrtA and gsfA, are required for the biosynthesis of 1 and 2, respectively. Both PKSs share similar domain architectures and lack a C-terminal thioesterase domain. We identified gsfI as the chlorinase involved in the biosynthesis of 2, because deletion of gsfI resulted in the accumula-tion of decholorogriseofulvin 3. Comparative anal-ysis with the P. chrysogenum genome revealed that both clusters are embedded within conserved syntenic regions of P. aethiopicum chromosomes. Discovery of the vrt and gsf clusters provided the basis for genetic and biochemical studies of the pathways. INTRODUCTION Fungal polyketides are an important class of secondary metab-olites, which include blockbuster drugs, mycotoxins, and pigments. There has been a growing interest in the engineering and heterologous expression of fungal polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and pathways to enable rational production of novel compounds (Schu\u0308mann and Hertweck, 2006). Understanding the molecular genetic basis of the biosynthesis of these structur-ally diverse compounds is the underlying key to achieve this goal. Over the past decade, there has been a steady growth of knowledge on the mechanisms of fungal polyketide biosynthetic pathways (Cox, 2007). Numerous fungal polyketides have been linked to their PKS genes and gene clusters (Hoffmeister and Keller, 2007), including some from the cryptic metabolic path-ways uncovered via genome mining (Bergmann et al., 2007; Bok et al., 2006; Chiang et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the biosyn-thetic pathways of many previously known fungal metabolites, some of which have important pharmaceutical applications, still remain to be elucidated. Chemistry & Biology 17, The filamentous fungus Penicillium aethiopicum Frisvad is known to produce a number of interesting secondary metabolites, including viridicatumtoxin (1), griseofulvin (2), and tryptoquialanine (4) (Figure 1), which are used as chemotaxo-nomic markers for the species (Frisvad and Samson, 2004). Tryptoquialanine is a tetrapeptide structurally similar to trypto-quivaline, which is a known tremorgen (Ariza et al., 2002; Clardy et al., 1975). Viridicatumtoxin is a hybrid polyketide-isoprenoid compound and is a rare example of tetracycline-like compounds produced by fungi. Compound 1 shares a common tetracyclic carboxamide core with the well-known tetracycline intermediate anhydrotetracycline; 1 has been reported to cause nephrotoxi-city (Hutchison et al., 1973) as well as exhibiting modest antitumor activity (Raju et al., 2004). An epoxide derivative of the compound, viridicatumtoxin B, was isolated from Penicillium species FR11 along with 1; both were shown to inhibit the growth of methicilin-and quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at 8\u201364 times higher activity than tetracycline (Zheng et al., 2008). Another known fungal compound with a tetracyclic carboxamide core is anthrotainin (TAN-1652) (Ishimaru et al., 1993; Wong et al., 1993), which is an inhibitor of neuropeptide substance P binding and is a potential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. The biosynthetic convergence of tetracycline-like compounds across the bacterial and fungal kingdoms, and their various bioactivities, further suggest that compounds of this structural type contain an \u2018\u2018evolutionarily privileged scaffold,\u2019\u2019 which is capable of interacting with a variety of biological targets. The co-occurrence of tetracyclic carboxamide core in both the tetracyclines from bacteria and 1 from fungi provides an excel-lent example to study the convergence of the polyketide pathway. Previous isotope feeding study (de Jesus et al., 1982) showed that 1 is produced by a mechanism significantly different from the bacterial tetracyclines (Thomas, 2001). The formation and attachment of the spirobicyclic ring of isoprenoid origin on a tetracycline scaffold also warrants detailed biosynthetic inves-tigation. Griseofulvin, which affects the function of mitotic spindle microtubules in mitosis, is an antifungal drug and has been in use for many years in medical and veterinary applications (Finkelstein et al., 1996). Although the use of 2 is mostly super-seded by newer and more effective synthetic antifungal agents, it remains useful for the treatment of some dermatophytes, such as Tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp) and Tinea pedis (athlete\u2019s foot). Recently, there has been a renewed interest in 2 owing to its specific antiproliferative and antimitotic activities toward cancer cells (Panda et al., 2005; Rebacz et al., 2007).

Proposed Pathway for the Biosynthesis of Viridicatumtoxin 1 Figure 6. Proposed Biosynthesis of Griseofulvin 2 Chemistry & Biology Viridicatumtoxin and Griseofulvin Gene Clusters gene was disrupted in the same manner as the two PKSs. Two positive gsfI disruptants, DgsfI-IV5 and DgsfI-IV11, were found after screening approximately 100 glufosinate-resistant trans-formants. LC-MS analysis showed that disruption of gsfI completely abolished the production of 2, whereas production of 3 remained (Figure 2). This finding confirmed the role of GsfI as a halogenase responsible for the regiospecific chlorination of 3 at the C13 position to form 2. The result also suggests that chlorination does not affect the formation of the grisan ring and could therefore be one of the last steps in the 2 biosynthetic pathway in P. aethiopicum (Figure 6). In conclusion, we have successfully associated two polyketide products to their corresponding gene clusters by bioinformatics and comparative analysis of the P. aethiopicum genome, and subsequently confirmed the functions of three of the biosyn-thetic genes by targeted gene replacement. As opposed to the previously reported low gene targeting efficiency in other Penicil-lium species (Casqueiro et al., 1999; Schumann and Hertweck, 2007), our results showed that gene targeting by double homol-ogous recombination in P. aethiopicum is relatively feasible. The P. aethiopicum transformation system developed in this study will facilitate future mechanistic studies of the two pathways, as well as the numerous other PKSs found in the genome of this fungus. SIGNIFICANCE The present study unveiled the biosynthetic gene clusters of two interesting polyketide spiro compounds, 1 and 2; 1 is a rare example of fungal compound that is structurally similar to the tetracycline antibiotics from bacteria, whereas 2 is an important antifungal drug that has been in use for a long time for treating dermatophyte infections. Localiza-tion of the two gene clusters within conserved syntenic regions of the P. aethiopicum genome raises interesting questions regarding the evolution of clustering of secondary metabolite genes in fungi and may provide insights to the underlying genetic basis of Penicillium chemotaxanomy. The vrt cluster is an interesting example of a biosynthetic pathway that encodes for a polyketide-isoprenoid hybrid compound in fungi. Understanding the exact mechanism by which the anhydrotetracycline-like core of 1 is formed by further targeted gene deletion and biochemical characteriza-tion of the gene products may provide new chemical insights. The unusual folding and cyclization of the isoprenoid moiety to form the spirobicylic ring also deserves further investiga-tion. More importantly, unveiling the clustered genes for biosynthesis of 1 has opened up the possibilities to generate novel tetracycline analogs using combinatorial biosynthetic strategies by integrating bacterial and fungal genes that can act on the tetracycline scaffolds. There has been a renewed interest in 2 owing to its newly discovered anticancer and antiviral properties. It is signifi-cant that this is the first report of the genetic basis of biosyn-thesis of 2. Further functional characterization of the gene cluster will advance our understanding of biosynthesis of 2 and could lead to isolation of intermediates that may have important implications in producing useful structural analogs either by enzymatic or chemical modifications. 492 Chemistry & Biology 17, 483\u2013494, May 28, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Strains and Culture Conditions P. aethiopicum, IBT 5753, was obtained from the IBT culture collection (Kgs. Lyngby, Denmark) and maintained on YMEG agar (4 g/l yeast extract, 10 g/l malt extract, and 16 g/l agar) or glucose minimal medium (GMM) (Cove, 1966) at 28NoneC. 454 Sequencing and Bioinformatic Analysis The genomic DNA used for sequencing was prepared as described elsewhere (Gauch et al., 1998) from mycelium grown in stationary liquid culture. The shotgun sequencing was performed at the GenoSeq (UCLA Genotyping and Sequencing Core) with the GS FLX Titanium system (Roche). The 454 sequencing reads were assembled into contigs with the GS De Novo Assembler software (Roche). The contigs were converted into BLAST database format for local BLAST search using stand-alone BLAST software (ver. 2.2.18) downloaded from the NCBI website. Gene predictions were per-formed using the FGENESH program (Softberry) and manually checked by comparing with homologous gene/proteins in the GenBank database. Func-tional domains in the translated protein sequences were predicted using Conserved Domain Search (NCBI) or InterproScan (EBI). Phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA4 software (Tamura et al., 2007). Fungal Transformation and Gene Disruption in P. aethiopicum Polyethylene glycol\u2013mediated transformation of P. aethiopicum was done essentially as described previously for A. nidulans (Andrianopoulos and Hynes, 1988; Chooi et al., 2008), except that the protoplasts were prepared with 3 mg/mL lysing enzymes (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mg/mL Yatalase (Takara Bio). Construction of fusion PCR knockout cassettes containing the bar gene were performed as described elsewhere (Szewczyk et al., 2006), except that the homologous regions flanking the resistant marker were increased to 2 kb. Fusion PCR products were gel purified and sequenced before using for transformation. The bar gene with the trpC promoter was amplified from the plasmid pBARKS1 (Pall and Brunelli, 1993), which was obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC). RNA-silencing plasmids were con-structed from pBARGPE1 (Pall and Brunelli, 1993) obtained from FGSC. Glu-fosinate used for the selection of bar transformants was prepared by extracting twice with equal volume of 1-butanol from commercial herbicide Finale (Bayer), which contains 11.33% (w/v) glufosinate-ammonium (Hays and Selker, 2000). The resulting aqueous phase was filter-sterilized and used directly at 40 mL/mL of GMM with 1.2 M sorbitol and 10 mM ammonium tartrate as the sole nitrogen source. Miniprep genomic DNA from P. aethiopicum trans-formants was used for PCR screening of gene deletants and was prepared as described elsewhere for A. nidulans (Chooi et al., 2008). Primers used for amplification of fusion PCR products and screening of transformants are listed in Table S2. Southern hybridizations were performed with DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II (Roche Applied Science) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Chemical Analysis and Compound Isolation For small-scale analysis, the P. aethiopicum wild-type and transformants were grown in YMEG liquid medium (20 mL) for 7 days at 28NoneC without shaking. The cultures were extracted with equal volume of ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness. The dried extracts were dissolved in methanol for LC-MS analysis. LC-MS was conducted with a Shimadzu 2010 EV Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometer by using both positive and negative electrospray ioniza-tion and a Phenomenex Luna 5 mL 2.0 3 100 mm C18 reverse-phase column. Samples were separated at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min on a linear gradient of 5 to 95% solvent B in 30 min followed by isocratic 95% solvent B for another 15 min (solvent A: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, solvent B: CH3CN with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid). The identity of 1 and 2 were confirmed by comparing the UV spectra, retention time and m/z value to the authentic standards: 1 (a gift from Dr. Won-gon Kim, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology) and 2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Dechlorogriseofulvin was isolated using a solvent-solvent partitioning scheme as described elsewhere (Hutchison et al., 1973) followed by crystalli-zation in MeOH. Briefly, the ethyl acetate extract from a two liters stationary liquid culture of a DgsfI mutant was evaporated to dryness and partition Ltd All rights reserved Chemistry & Biology Viridicatumtoxin and Griseofulvin Gene Clusters between CHCl3/H2O. The CHCl3 layer was further partitioned with hexane/ MeOH (90%). The 90% MeOH layer was dried completely and redissolved in a small volume of MeOH (1 mL). Formation of white crystals, which was later confirmed to be 3, was observed when the MeOH extract was left undisturbed at room temperature (further crystallized at 4NoneC). The crystals (28 mg) were collected by filtration, washed in cold methanol and dried. Purity of the compound was checked by LC-MS and the structure was confirmed by NMR with reference to published spectra (Table S3).

        "Chemistry & Biology Article Identification of the Viridicatumtoxin and Griseofulvin Gene Clusters from Penicillium aethiopicum Yit-Heng Chooi,1 Ralph Cacho,1 and Yi Tang1,* 1Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA *Correspondence: yitang@ucla.edu DOI 10.1016/j.chembiol.2010.03.015 SUMMARY Penicillium aethiopicum produces two structurally interesting and biologically active polyketides: the tetracycline-like viridicatumtoxin 1 and the classic antifungal agent griseofulvin 2. Here, we report the concurrent discovery of the two corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (vrt and gsf) by 454 shotgun sequencing. Gene deletions confirmed that two nonreducing PKSs (NRPKSs), vrtA and gsfA, are required for the biosynthesis of 1 and 2, respectively. Both PKSs share similar domain architectures and lack a C-terminal thioesterase domain. We identified gsfI as the chlorinase involved in the biosynthesis of 2, because deletion of gsfI resulted in the accumula-tion of decholorogriseofulvin 3. Comparative anal-ysis with the P. chrysogenum genome revealed that both clusters are embedded within conserved syntenic regions of P. aethiopicum chromosomes. Discovery of the vrt and gsf clusters provided the basis for genetic and biochemical studies of the pathways. INTRODUCTION Fungal polyketides are an important class of secondary metab-olites, which include blockbuster drugs, mycotoxins, and pigments. There has been a growing interest in the engineering and heterologous expression of fungal polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and pathways to enable rational production of novel compounds (Schu\u0308mann and Hertweck, 2006). Understanding the molecular genetic basis of the biosynthesis of these structur-ally diverse compounds is the underlying key to achieve this goal. Over the past decade, there has been a steady growth of knowledge on the mechanisms of fungal polyketide biosynthetic pathways (Cox, 2007). Numerous fungal polyketides have been linked to their PKS genes and gene clusters (Hoffmeister and Keller, 2007), including some from the cryptic metabolic path-ways uncovered via genome mining (Bergmann et al., 2007; Bok et al., 2006; Chiang et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the biosyn-thetic pathways of many previously known fungal metabolites, some of which have important pharmaceutical applications, still remain to be elucidated.",
        "Chemistry & Biology 17,",
        "The filamentous fungus Penicillium aethiopicum Frisvad is known to produce a number of interesting secondary metabolites, including viridicatumtoxin (1), griseofulvin (2), and tryptoquialanine (4) (Figure 1), which are used as chemotaxo-nomic markers for the species (Frisvad and Samson, 2004). Tryptoquialanine is a tetrapeptide structurally similar to trypto-quivaline, which is a known tremorgen (Ariza et al., 2002; Clardy et al., 1975). Viridicatumtoxin is a hybrid polyketide-isoprenoid compound and is a rare example of tetracycline-like compounds produced by fungi. Compound 1 shares a common tetracyclic carboxamide core with the well-known tetracycline intermediate anhydrotetracycline; 1 has been reported to cause nephrotoxi-city (Hutchison et al., 1973) as well as exhibiting modest antitumor activity (Raju et al., 2004). An epoxide derivative of the compound, viridicatumtoxin B, was isolated from Penicillium species FR11 along with 1; both were shown to inhibit the growth of methicilin-and quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at 8\u201364 times higher activity than tetracycline (Zheng et al., 2008). Another known fungal compound with a tetracyclic carboxamide core is anthrotainin (TAN-1652) (Ishimaru et al., 1993; Wong et al., 1993), which is an inhibitor of neuropeptide substance P binding and is a potential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. The biosynthetic convergence of tetracycline-like compounds across the bacterial and fungal kingdoms, and their various bioactivities, further suggest that compounds of this structural type contain an \u2018\u2018evolutionarily privileged scaffold,\u2019\u2019 which is capable of interacting with a variety of biological targets. The co-occurrence of tetracyclic carboxamide core in both the tetracyclines from bacteria and 1 from fungi provides an excel-lent example to study the convergence of the polyketide pathway. Previous isotope feeding study (de Jesus et al., 1982) showed that 1 is produced by a mechanism significantly different from the bacterial tetracyclines (Thomas, 2001). The formation and attachment of the spirobicyclic ring of isoprenoid origin on a tetracycline scaffold also warrants detailed biosynthetic inves-tigation. Griseofulvin, which affects the function of mitotic spindle microtubules in mitosis, is an antifungal drug and has been in use for many years in medical and veterinary applications (Finkelstein et al., 1996). Although the use of 2 is mostly super-seded by newer and more effective synthetic antifungal agents, it remains useful for the treatment of some dermatophytes, such as Tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp) and Tinea pedis (athlete\u2019s foot). Recently, there has been a renewed interest in 2 owing to its specific antiproliferative and antimitotic activities toward cancer cells (Panda et al., 2005; Rebacz et al., 2007).

        "gene was disrupted in the same manner as the two PKSs. Two positive gsfI disruptants, DgsfI-IV5 and DgsfI-IV11, were found after screening approximately 100 glufosinate-resistant trans-formants. LC-MS analysis showed that disruption of gsfI completely abolished the production of 2, whereas production of 3 remained (Figure 2). This finding confirmed the role of GsfI as a halogenase responsible for the regiospecific chlorination of 3 at the C13 position to form 2. The result also suggests that chlorination does not affect the formation of the grisan ring and could therefore be one of the last steps in the 2 biosynthetic pathway in P. aethiopicum (Figure 6).",
        "In conclusion, we have successfully associated two polyketide",
        "products to their corresponding gene clusters by bioinformatics and comparative analysis of the P. aethiopicum genome, and subsequently confirmed the functions of three of the biosyn-thetic genes by targeted gene replacement. As opposed to the previously reported low gene targeting efficiency in other Penicil-lium species (Casqueiro et al., 1999; Schumann and Hertweck, 2007), our results showed that gene targeting by double homol-ogous recombination in P. aethiopicum is relatively feasible. The P. aethiopicum transformation system developed in this study will facilitate future mechanistic studies of the two pathways, as well as the numerous other PKSs found in the genome of this fungus.",
        "SIGNIFICANCE",
        "The present study unveiled the biosynthetic gene clusters of two interesting polyketide spiro compounds, 1 and 2; 1 is a rare example of fungal compound that is structurally similar to the tetracycline antibiotics from bacteria, whereas 2 is an important antifungal drug that has been in use for a long time for treating dermatophyte infections. Localiza-tion of the two gene clusters within conserved syntenic regions of the P. aethiopicum genome raises interesting questions regarding the evolution of clustering of secondary metabolite genes in fungi and may provide insights to the underlying genetic basis of Penicillium chemotaxanomy.",
        "The vrt cluster is an interesting example of a biosynthetic",
        "pathway that encodes for a polyketide-isoprenoid hybrid compound in fungi. Understanding the exact mechanism by which the anhydrotetracycline-like core of 1 is formed by further targeted gene deletion and biochemical characteriza-tion of the gene products may provide new chemical insights. The unusual folding and cyclization of the isoprenoid moiety to form the spirobicylic ring also deserves further investiga-tion. More importantly, unveiling the clustered genes for biosynthesis of 1 has opened up the possibilities to generate novel tetracycline analogs using combinatorial biosynthetic strategies by integrating bacterial and fungal genes that can act on the tetracycline scaffolds.",
        "There has been a renewed interest in 2 owing to its newly",
        "discovered anticancer and antiviral properties. It is signifi-cant that this is the first report of the genetic basis of biosyn-thesis of 2. Further functional characterization of the gene cluster will advance our understanding of biosynthesis of 2 and could lead to isolation of intermediates that may have important implications in producing useful structural analogs either by enzymatic or chemical modifications. 492 Chemistry & Biology 17, 483\u2013494, May 28, 2010 \u00aa2010 Elsevier",
        "EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Strains and Culture Conditions P. aethiopicum, IBT 5753, was obtained from the IBT culture collection (Kgs. Lyngby, Denmark) and maintained on YMEG agar (4 g/l yeast extract, 10 g/l malt extract, and 16 g/l agar) or glucose minimal medium (GMM) (Cove, 1966) at 28NoneC. 454 Sequencing and Bioinformatic Analysis The genomic DNA used for sequencing was prepared as described elsewhere (Gauch et al., 1998) from mycelium grown in stationary liquid culture. The shotgun sequencing was performed at the GenoSeq (UCLA Genotyping and Sequencing Core) with the GS FLX Titanium system (Roche). The 454 sequencing reads were assembled into contigs with the GS De Novo Assembler software (Roche). The contigs were converted into BLAST database format for local BLAST search using stand-alone BLAST software (ver. 2.2.18) downloaded from the NCBI website. Gene predictions were per-formed using the FGENESH program (Softberry) and manually checked by comparing with homologous gene/proteins in the GenBank database. Func-tional domains in the translated protein sequences were predicted using Conserved Domain Search (NCBI) or InterproScan (EBI). Phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA4 software (Tamura et al., 2007). Fungal Transformation and Gene Disruption in P. aethiopicum Polyethylene glycol\u2013mediated transformation of P. aethiopicum was done essentially as described previously for A. nidulans (Andrianopoulos and Hynes, 1988; Chooi et al., 2008), except that the protoplasts were prepared with 3 mg/mL lysing enzymes (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mg/mL Yatalase (Takara Bio). Construction of fusion PCR knockout cassettes containing the bar gene were performed as described elsewhere (Szewczyk et al., 2006), except that the homologous regions flanking the resistant marker were increased to 2 kb. Fusion PCR products were gel purified and sequenced before using for transformation. The bar gene with the trpC promoter was amplified from the plasmid pBARKS1 (Pall and Brunelli, 1993), which was obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC). RNA-silencing plasmids were con-structed from pBARGPE1 (Pall and Brunelli, 1993) obtained from FGSC. Glu-fosinate used for the selection of bar transformants was prepared by extracting twice with equal volume of 1-butanol from commercial herbicide Finale (Bayer), which contains 11.33% (w/v) glufosinate-ammonium (Hays and Selker, 2000). The resulting aqueous phase was filter-sterilized and used directly at 40 mL/mL of GMM with 1.2 M sorbitol and 10 mM ammonium tartrate as the sole nitrogen source. Miniprep genomic DNA from P. aethiopicum trans-formants was used for PCR screening of gene deletants and was prepared as described elsewhere for A. nidulans (Chooi et al., 2008). Primers used for amplification of fusion PCR products and screening of transformants are listed in Table S2. Southern hybridizations were performed with DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II (Roche Applied Science) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Chemical Analysis and Compound Isolation For small-scale analysis, the P. aethiopicum wild-type and transformants were grown in YMEG liquid medium (20 mL) for 7 days at 28NoneC without shaking. The cultures were extracted with equal volume of ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness. The dried extracts were dissolved in methanol for LC-MS analysis. LC-MS was conducted with a Shimadzu 2010 EV Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometer by using both positive and negative electrospray ioniza-tion and a Phenomenex Luna 5 mL 2.0 3 100 mm C18 reverse-phase column. Samples were separated at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min on a linear gradient of 5 to 95% solvent B in 30 min followed by isocratic 95% solvent B for another 15 min (solvent A: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, solvent B: CH3CN with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid). The identity of 1 and 2 were confirmed by comparing the UV spectra, retention time and m/z value to the authentic standards: 1 (a gift from Dr. Won-gon Kim, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology) and 2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Dechlorogriseofulvin was isolated using a solvent-solvent partitioning scheme as described elsewhere (Hutchison et al., 1973) followed by crystalli-zation in MeOH. Briefly, the ethyl acetate extract from a two liters stationary liquid culture of a DgsfI mutant was evaporated to dryness and partition Ltd All rights reserved",

The 90% MeOH layer was dried completely and redissolved in a small volume of MeOH (1 mL). Formation of white crystals, which was later confirmed to be 3, was observed when the MeOH extract was left undisturbed at room temperature (further crystallized at 4NoneC). The crystals (28 mg) were collected by filtration, washed in cold methanol and dried. Purity of the compound was checked by LC-MS and the structure was confirmed by NMR with reference to published spectra (Table S3).
