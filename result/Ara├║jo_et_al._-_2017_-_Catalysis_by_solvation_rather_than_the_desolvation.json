Limab and Jero\u0302nimo Lameira *a Chlorinase SalL halogenate S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) reacts with chloride to generate 50-chloro-50-deoxyadenosine and L-methionine through a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. Although it is known that chlorinase enhances the rate of reaction by a factor of 1.2 None 1017 fold, it is not entirely clear how this is accomplished. The search for the origin of the catalysis of chlorinase and other enzymes has led to a desolvation hypothesis. In the present work, we have used well defined computational simulations in order to evaluate the origin of the catalytic efficiency of chlorinase. The results demonstrate that the catalytic effect of chlorinase is associated with the fact that ClNone is \u2018\u2018solvated\u2019\u2019 by the protein more than by the reference solution reaction, which is not in accordance with proposed catalysis by desolvation. It is found that chlorinase SalL active sites provide electrostatic stabilization of the transition state which is the origin of its catalytic effect. Introduction Adenosyl-chloride synthase or chlorinase SalL is involved in chloride insertion into the marine natural product salinosporamide A from Salinospora tropica.1 This enzyme mediates a nucleophilic reaction between SAM and chloride ions to generate 50-chloro-50-deoxyadenosine (50-ClDA) and L-methionine (see Fig. 1). Chlorinase SalL catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of salinosporamide A, a compound that displays 20S proteasome inhibition and has entered clinical trials for multiple myeloma and other cancer treatments.2 High-resolution crystal structures of SalL and active site mutants in complex with substrates and products support the SN2 nucleophilic substitution mechanism and further illuminate halide specificity in this newly discovered halogenase family.1 In light of the biological importance of this enzyme, it is important to study the molecular origin of its catalytic power. In a recent contribution, Wolfenden and coworkers have provided very useful information on the catalysis of alkyl transfer from SAM to halide ions,3 where they have suggested that SAM dependent halide alkylating enzymes catalyze the reaction by the \u2018\u2018desolvation\u2019\u2019 effect.4 The desolvation proposal suggests that an enzyme enhances the reactivity of a polar or a charged reacting fragment by shifting it from a polar environ-ment to its nonpolar cavity, resulting in reactant destabilization relative to a less polar transition state.5 We note, however, that computational works6\u20138 have indicated that there is no justifi-cation for this hypothesis, since the reduction of the activation barrier appears to result mainly from electrostatic interactions that \u2018solvate\u2019 the reactant state (RS) and the transition state (TS) in the protein more than in solution.9,10 Recently, we have used a free energy surface and the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach11 to investi-gate biomolecular systems with an emphasis on enzymatic reactions.7,12\u201314 In the present work, we evaluated the activation free energy for SAM chlorination in both the protein environment and aqueous solution to clarify whether chlorinase can catalyze the formation of 50-ClDA and L-methionine (Fig. 1) by desolvation or electrostatic preorganization. Our analysis is supported by the electrostatic preorganization effect10 and the idea that an enzyme replaces water by acting as a strong \u2018\u2018solvent\u2019\u2019.6 Methods The EVB method In this work, we have used the empirical valence bond (EVB) method,15 to compute the free energy activation barriers for the reaction catalyzed by chlorinase. In this method, the reaction is described by diabatic states that correspond to classical valence bond (VB) structures which represent the reactants (or intermediate) and product states, where the reaction free energy profile is calculated on the ground state energy surface, Eg.

The off-diagonal elements are usually represented by: Hij = Aije [Nonemij(rabNonerab,0)] (3) Here, Aij and mij are empirical constants that are calibrated on the basis of the computational reproduction of the experi-mental free energy profile and rab represents the distance between the two atoms characterizing the ith and jth states of the affected bond. In addition, the Hij elements are assumed to be the same in the gas phase, solution and protein. In order to simulate the formation of the chemical bond during the transition between two EVB states, e1 and e2 (initial and final states), we conduct MD simulations of the system on a mapping potential, em, that is determined by a linear combi-nation of the initial and final states: em = (1 None lm)e1 + lme2 (0 r lm r 1) (4) where, lm is an order parameter going from 0 to 1 in N + 1 windows as the initial state is changed to the final state. The free energy change between the consecutive steps can be calculated by the forward FEP procedure as:16 DGm-m+1 = NonebNone1 lnhe{Noneb[em(lm+1)Noneem(lm)]}im (5) After MD-FEP calculations, the free energy functional that corresponds to the adiabatic ground state surface Eg was obtained by the FEP-umbrella sampling (FEP/US) method16,17 that can be written as: Dg x0\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc XiNone1 m\u00bc0 DGm!m\u00fe1 None bNone1 ln d xNone x0\u00f0 \u00dee Noneb EgNoneem li\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd Nonef g D E em * + i (6) where PiNone1 m\u00bc0 DGm!m\u00fe1 represents the free energy difference between the first and ith mapping potential, d corresponds to Dirac\u2019s delta function. em is the mapping potential that keeps x in the region of x0. The generated reaction coordinate, x, is usually taken as the energy gap (x = e1 None e2). This selection is particularly powerful when one tries to represent all of the many dimensional solvent space by a single coordinate. Addi-tionally, it is important to note that the diabatic free energy profiles of the reactant and product represent the microscopic equivalent18 of the Marcus parabolas.19 The LRA method The linear response approximation (LRA) treatment20,21 provides a good estimation for the free energy associated with the change between two potential surfaces (U1 and U2) by DG(U1 -U2) = 12(hU2 None U1i1 + hU2 None U1i2) (7) The notation hii designates an average over trajectories propagated on the potential energy surface Ui. Herein, we have used the LRA approach to calculate the free energy of changing the charges of a given state from actual EVB charges (Q) to the charges of the nonpolar state (zero residual changes). It is important to clarify that only electrostatic interactions were considered for evaluating the solvation free energy for both RS and TS, where vdW parameters within the uncharged state were kept identical to those within the charged state. Since we are interested in calculating the solvation energy for each fragment involved in the reaction (SAM+ + ClNone) we have constructed (only for charging process) a second EVB state with a minimum whose structure resembles the geometry of the TS. Recently, we have used this approach in order to have the minimum of EVB2 shifted to the position of the TS for paradynamics studies (for more details about the EVB2 shift see ref. 11). The system The initial structure for calculations was taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the 2Q6I PDB code,1 which shows SalL-Y70T with SAM and ClNone. In order to simulate the native structure, we have modeled the Tyr residue instead of Thr in position 70. The systems included the reacting fragments (Fig. S1, ESI\u2020), the protein and explicit water molecules. The simulation systems were solvated using the surface constrained all atom solvent model (SCAAS).22 Here, we have used a water sphere with a radius of 20 \u00c5 centered on the substrate and surrounded first by a 2 \u00c5 grid of Langevin dipoles, and then by a bulk solvent. Long-range electrostatic effects were treated using Fig. 1 Reaction involving SAM and chloride ions to generate 50-ClDA and L-Met catalyzed by SalL methyl transferase.

Phys., 2017, 19, 21350--21356 This journal is\u00a9 the Owner Societies 2017 the local reaction field (LRF) method. A cut-off of 10 \u00c5 was used for the calculation of long-range interactions. In addition, the free energy was obtained using the canonical (NVT) ensemble which can be generalized to the Gibbs free energy (NPT) and other thermodynamic ensembles. Hydrogen atoms were added using the MOLARIS-XG program package.23,24 Free energy perturbation mapping was performed in 41 frames of 20 ps length each for the movement along the reaction coordinate, using the SCAAS model, after the respective system underwent a 1500 ps relaxation run. All simulations were performed at 300 K using a 1 fs time step. In order to obtain reliable sampling, the simulations were repeated at least five times under different initial conditions (obtained from arbitrary points in the relaxation trajec-tory after the initial 1500 ps relaxation run) for each reacting system. Weak residue constraints of 0.3 kcal molNone1 \u00c5None2 were applied to region I (part of the system described by the EVB) that involves part of SAM and ClNone (Fig. S1, ESI\u2020). All EVB calculations were carried out by the MOLARIS-XG simulation program23,24 using the ENZYMIX force field. It is important to clarify that region I has the same amount of atoms in water and protein, since we are assuming the fact that the reacting system is the same in the enzyme and solution, the number of EVB atoms resulted then to be 12. In this study, the reaction in water was studied using the MOLARIS-XG simulation package, where the system included the reacting fragments (Fig. S1, ESI\u2020) plus explicit water molecules. In this case, we have also used a water sphere with a radius of 20 \u00c5 centered on the substrate and surrounded first by a 2 \u00c5 grid of Langevin dipoles. It is also important to point out that the EVB approach relies on calibration of empirical parameters to describe the energetics of a reference reaction solution. Once calibrated, the same parameters are used to describe the process in an enzyme active site. Herein, we calibrated the empirical parameters in order to reproduce the activation free energy for the reaction in solution obtained from the experimental value.3 The specific EVB parameters used for calibrating the EVB model are described in the ESI\u2020 (Table S4). Results and discussion Evaluating the reaction in water and the gas phase According to the desolvation proposal, if an enzyme reaction takes place in the absence of water, then the reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme that is able to create an environment around reactants that is similar to the gas phase.3,4 In other words, a nonpolar enzyme active site can catalyze reactions by desolvating reactants, where the destabilization of charged ground states can contribute to catalysis. In addition, experi-mental data25 and calculations26,27 have shown that reactions in the gas-phase involve a smaller activation barrier than the corresponding reactions in solution. Recently, Wolfenden and coworkers3 have studied the catalysis of alkyl transfer from SAM to halide ions in solution. In their conclusion they have suggested that SAM dependent halide alkylating enzymes catalyze their reaction by desolvation. On the other hand, Warshel and coworkers have indicated that the catalytic effect of enzymes is mainly due to the optimal orientation of the permanent dipoles of the enzyme28,29 (see Fig. 2). In accordance with the electrostatic preorganization idea10 the reduction of the activation barrier appears to result mainly from electrostatic interactions that \u2018solvate\u2019 the TS in the enzyme more effectively than the corres-ponding TS in solution.21 In this study, we calculated the activation barrier for the nucleophilic attack of ClNone on a methyl group bonded to the sulfur atom of trimethylsulfonium, (CH3)3S +, in aqueous solution and in the gas-phase using DFT,30 HF31 and MP232 levels of theory (see Table S1, ESI\u2020). All quantum simulations were performed using Gaussian 09.33 After the quantum mechanical calculations in the gas-phase, we have selected stationary points (reactants, transition state and products) in order to analyse the solvation effect of the methyl transfer reaction using the polarizable continuum model (CPCM),34 where a single point calculation using 6-31+g(d,p) was carried out for each optimized geometry obtained from gas phase calculations. Interestingly, it was found that HF approxi-mation provides the barrier calculated close to the experimental results obtained for the reaction in solution3 (see Table S1, ESI\u2020). Fig. 3 shows the free energy profile obtained from HF calculations Fig. 2 Illustrating the dipoles in the SN2 reaction studied (a) water and (b) protein active site environments. The dipoles are especially aligned (pre-organized) in proteins where the reorganization energy is lower than in water. Fig. 3 Energy profile obtained from HF/6-31+(d,p) for the SN2 reaction.

The results depicted in Fig. 3 suggest that activation free energy for the reaction studied in solution is higher than for the reaction in the gas-phase. In this sense, one could suggest that the reaction in an enzyme environment has a lower activation barrier, just like the analogous reaction in the gas-phase (Fig. 3). Indeed, there are reactions accelerated by moving from polar to nonpolar solvents.35 However, reactions in nonpolar solvents are not the same as reactions in the active sites of an enzyme which is surrounded by a polar solvent. In addition, it is important to emphasize that the only way to test desolvation proposal is evaluating the binding energies of RS and TS in the protein and aqueous solution. Besides, analyzing only energetic diagrams (Fig. 3) for reactions in water and the gas-phase cannot provide the answers about the catalysis in the enzyme active sites, where there are key intermolecular interactions between the substrate and catalytic residues. Evaluating the reaction in water and proteins Despite significant advances in computational power, the use of a higher-level quantum mechanical approach remains cumbersome for modeling reactions in proteins, particularly if one is interested in obtaining convergent free energies.36 This problem is circum-vented by the EVB15 which is a semi-empirical method used to describe bond-breaking and bond-making processes.36 The EVB surface of proteins is calibrated using the experimental information for the reaction in aqueous solution which allowed us to explore the free energy surface in the chlorinase without the challenge of obtaining fully converging QM(ai)/MM. Therefore, using the reported values for the reaction in water3 (34.50 kcal molNone1) we obtain Dgzcage \u00bc 32:0 kcalmolNone1 for the reaction in solution, con-sidering the fact that the free energy costs of bringing the reacting fragment to the same solvent cage is around 2.5 kcal molNone1.8,9 For the reaction catalyzed by the native chlorinase1 we obtained Dgzcat \u00bc 20:12 kcalmolNone1 from the experimental data.1 The calculated activation energy for reactions in water and in the chlorinase is compared to the corresponding observed values described above summarized in Table 1. The calculated activation free energies for reactions in the protein and water are in a reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental values. The free energy profiles for reactions in the enzyme and aqueous solution are presented in Fig. 4. To explore the source of the large enhancement produced by chlorinase, we have calculated the electrostatic energies of the RS and TS in both the protein and water environments. In the reaction studied here, the charge distributions change from localized charge at the RS to delocalized charge at the TS, where we have +1 (SAM+), None1 (ClNone) for the RS and +0.73,None0.73 for the TS (Mulliken charges for the reaction in solution). In this sense, it would be difficult for the enzyme dipole to solvate the TS more than the RS and it would be even more difficult to obtain sufficient solvation by the solvent dipoles in the reference reaction. The solvation energies of the RS and TS in the protein and in water were calculated using the LRA approach. The electrostatic interactions between the substrate and its surrounding for RS and TS are depicted in Table 2, where hUQ None U0iQ correspond to trajectories where the substrate charges exist for the environment and hUQ None U0i0 correspond to trajectories where the substrate charges do not exist for the environment. As can be seen from Table 2, the protein solvates the RS more than water does, taking 21354 | Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017, 19, 21350--21356 This journal is\u00a9 the Owner Societies 2017 toward the transition state charge center.35 Thus, DGmm is smaller than in water, and less free energy is spent on creating the oriented dipoles of the protein transition state. Analyzing the reaction in the Y70T mutant We also evaluated the catalytic effect of Y70T mutation in chlorinase. Eusta\u0301quio and co-workers1 have reported kinetic parameters for the formation of 50-ClDA and L-methionine in the chlorinase Y70T mutant, using their reported value, we estimated Dgzexp \u00bc 24:4 kcalmolNone1 for the reaction catalyzed by this protein mutant. In accordance with the desolvation idea the polarity of the native enzyme active sites would be less effective than in its Y70T mutant because active site residues desolvate the reacting fragments and thus improve the catalytic efficiency in native. However, in accordance with our computa-tional simulations we note that the difference in the catalytic effect of the native and mutant is almost entirely due to the difference in the electrostatic contribution to the activation barrier. Here the electrostatic stabilization of ClNone in the RS and TS in the native is larger than in the mutant enzyme and this leads to a larger activation barrier in the mutant. Therefore, the polarity of the native enzyme active sites is more effective in native than in its Y70T mutant which implies that desolvation cannot enhance the rate of reaction for native, since the native solvates better ClNone than the mutant does. Chlorinase Y70T mutation increases g which is supported by the idea that preoriented dipoles in an enzyme can account for catalysis. It is important to note that solvation energies of the RS and TS can be obtaining by the sum of the solvation energies of the reacting fragment (SAM+ + ClNone). In this case, the results show that calculated activation energy (DDGzsolv) for native, mutant and water corresponds to DDGzsolv \u00bc 34:2, DDG z solv \u00bc 52:4 and DDGzsolv \u00bc 52:2 kcalmolNone1, respectively (see Table S5, ESI\u2020). In fact, the effect of the mutation is overestimated when SAM+ is taken into account (see Table S5, ESI\u2020). However, it is also important to mention that due to the size of SAM+, the changes in solvation energy for this cation are lower than for ClNone (see Table S5, ESI\u2020). It is likely that much more extensive sampling would improve the results for the mutational effect. However, this is not the purpose of the present work. Here, we have focused on the results obtained for the chloride anion. It is worth mentioning that there are more apolar residues present in the active sites of chlorinase than polar residues (see Fig. 5). Despite the apolar character inside the pocket of chlorinase. The key residues are positioned in order to create an optimal electrostatic environment for stabilizing the nega-tive charge of chloride ions. For example, Gly131 is an apolar residue. On the other hand, chloride ions form hydrogen bonds with the amide backbone of Gly131 (2.8 \u00c5) as well as an internal water molecule and a threonine residue in the active sites of chlorinase (see Fig. 6). Interestingly, experimental data show that replacement of Gly131 with a serine led to the loss of SalL halogenase activity.1 Despite that, chlorinase acts on its substrates without assistance of metals or polar residues.

Phys., 2017, 19, 21350--21356 | 21355 enzyme uses key active site interactions that optimally stabilize the transition state during the reaction. In the case of chlorinase, strong hydrogen bond interactions between Gly131 and ClNone and pre oriented dipoles in its active sites are sufficient to account for the rate enhancements achieved by this enzyme that manages to stabilize the system by hydrogen bonds (dipoles) which are especially aligned towards the negatively charged chloride. Therefore, our computational results did not find that SAM dependent halide alkylating enzymes catalyze their reaction by the desolvation of ClNone in the active sites of chlorinase. We found here that in the related case of chlorinase ClNone is more stable in the enzyme than in water. Thus, the catalytic effect of chlorinase appears to result mainly from electrostatic interactions that \u2018\u2018solvate\u2019\u2019 ClNone in the enzyme more effectively than in solution which is in agreement with the electrostatic idea.28 Conclusion In principle, desolvation proposal and the electrostatic preor-ganization effect cannot be evaluated without computational modeling. Here, we have addressed the main point raised in a recent experimental study that has proposed that SAM depen-dent halide alkylating enzymes catalyze their reaction through a desolvation mechanism. Desolvation proposal suggests that enzymes work by moving polar or charged reacting fragments to a non-polar environment and thus destabilizing the ground state. However, in the case of the reaction catalyzed by chlorinase, we found that the RS is more stable in the enzyme than in water and that thus the desolvation idea does not apply to catalysis of alkyl transfer from SAM to halide ions. In fact, it is well known that a nonpolar solvent can accelerate SN2 reactions. However, only the observation that some reactions are accelerated upon moving from polar to nonpolar solvents cannot support the idea that an enzyme accelerates its catalysis reaction by resembling the corresponding gas-phase reaction. It is important to point out that substrates make key intermolecular interactions with residues in the active sites of enzymes and such interactions stabilize the RS. Further-more, the difference between the solvation free energy of the RS and TS is smaller in the protein (B19 kcal molNone1) than in the water solution (B32 kcal molNone1), which explains the large catalytic effect in the enzyme, where there is a preferential stabilization of the less-polar TS. Our results also show that chlorinase solvates ClNone more than water does, which is critical for the RS and TS electrostatic stabilization. In summary, the analysis described in this manu-script indicates that SAM-dependent chlorinase does not use the desolvation mechanism, but provides the electrostatic stabilization of chloride ions necessary for catalysis.

        "Chlorinase SalL halogenate S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) reacts with chloride to generate 50-chloro-50-deoxyadenosine and L-methionine through a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. Although it is known that chlorinase enhances the rate of reaction by a factor of 1.2 None 1017 fold, it is not entirely clear how this is accomplished. The search for the origin of the catalysis of chlorinase and other enzymes has led to a desolvation hypothesis. In the present work, we have used well defined computational simulations in order to evaluate the origin of the catalytic efficiency of chlorinase. The results demonstrate that the catalytic effect of chlorinase is associated with the fact that ClNone is \u2018\u2018solvated\u2019\u2019 by the protein more than by the reference solution reaction, which is not in accordance with proposed catalysis by desolvation. It is found that chlorinase SalL active sites provide electrostatic stabilization of the transition state which is the origin of its catalytic effect.",
        "Introduction Adenosyl-chloride synthase or chlorinase SalL is involved in chloride insertion into the marine natural product salinosporamide A from Salinospora tropica.1 This enzyme mediates a nucleophilic reaction between SAM and chloride ions to generate 50-chloro-50-deoxyadenosine (50-ClDA) and L-methionine (see Fig. 1). Chlorinase SalL catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of salinosporamide A, a compound that displays 20S proteasome inhibition and has entered clinical trials for multiple myeloma and other cancer treatments.2 High-resolution crystal structures of SalL and active site mutants in complex with substrates and products support the SN2 nucleophilic substitution mechanism and further illuminate halide specificity in this newly discovered halogenase family.1 In light of the biological importance of this enzyme, it is important to study the molecular origin of its catalytic power.",
        "In a recent contribution, Wolfenden and coworkers have provided very useful information on the catalysis of alkyl transfer from SAM to halide ions,3 where they have suggested that SAM dependent halide alkylating enzymes catalyze the reaction by the \u2018\u2018desolvation\u2019\u2019 effect.4 The desolvation proposal suggests that an enzyme enhances the reactivity of a polar or a",

Our analysis is supported by the electrostatic preorganization effect10 and the idea that an enzyme replaces water by acting as a strong \u2018\u2018solvent\u2019\u2019.6",

Since we are interested in calculating the solvation energy for each fragment involved in the reaction (SAM+ + ClNone) we have constructed (only for charging process) a second EVB state with a minimum whose structure resembles the geometry of the TS.

        "Free energy perturbation mapping was performed in 41 frames of 20 ps length each for the movement along the reaction coordinate, using the SCAAS model, after the respective system underwent a 1500 ps relaxation run. All simulations were performed at 300 K using a 1 fs time step.

All EVB calculations were carried out by the MOLARIS-XG simulation program23,24 using the ENZYMIX force field. It is important to clarify that region I has the same amount of atoms in water and protein, since we are assuming the fact that the reacting system is the same in the enzyme and solution, the number of EVB atoms resulted then to be 12. In this study, the reaction in water was studied using the MOLARIS-XG simulation package, where the system included the reacting fragments (Fig. S1, ESI\u2020) plus explicit water molecules. In this case, we have also used a water sphere with a radius of 20 \u00c5 centered on the substrate and surrounded first by a 2 \u00c5 grid of Langevin dipoles. It is also important to point out that the EVB approach relies on calibration of empirical parameters to describe the energetics of a reference reaction solution. Once calibrated, the same parameters are used to describe the process in an enzyme active site. Herein, we calibrated the empirical parameters in order to reproduce the activation free energy for the reaction in solution obtained from the experimental value.3 The specific EVB parameters used for calibrating the EVB model are described in the ESI\u2020 (Table S4).",
        "Results and discussion Evaluating the reaction in water and the gas phase According to the desolvation proposal, if an enzyme reaction takes place in the absence of water, then the reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme that is able to create an environment around reactants that is similar to the gas phase.3,4 In other words, a nonpolar enzyme active site can catalyze reactions by desolvating reactants, where the destabilization of charged ground states can contribute to catalysis. In addition, experi-mental data25 and calculations26,27 have shown that reactions in the gas-phase involve a smaller activation barrier than the corresponding reactions in solution. Recently, Wolfenden and coworkers3 have studied the catalysis of alkyl transfer from SAM to halide ions in solution. In their conclusion they have suggested that SAM dependent halide alkylating enzymes catalyze their reaction by desolvation. On the other hand, Warshel and coworkers have indicated that the catalytic effect of enzymes is mainly due to the optimal orientation of the permanent dipoles of",

In accordance with the electrostatic preorganization idea10 the reduction of the activation barrier appears to result mainly from electrostatic interactions that \u2018solvate\u2019 the TS in the enzyme more effectively than the corres-ponding TS in solution.21 In this study, we calculated the activation barrier for the nucleophilic attack of ClNone on a methyl group bonded to the sulfur atom of trimethylsulfonium, (CH3)3S +, in aqueous solution and in the gas-phase using DFT,30 HF31 and MP232 levels of theory (see Table S1, ESI\u2020). All quantum simulations were performed using Gaussian 09.33 After the quantum mechanical calculations in the gas-phase, we have selected stationary points (reactants, transition state and products) in order to analyse the solvation effect of the methyl transfer reaction using the polarizable continuum model (CPCM),34 where a single point calculation using 6-31+g(d,p) was carried out for each optimized geometry obtained from gas phase calculations. Interestingly, it was found that HF approxi-mation provides the barrier calculated close to the experimental results obtained for the reaction in solution3 (see Table S1, ESI\u2020).

The results depicted in Fig. 3 suggest that activation free energy for the reaction studied in solution is higher than for the reaction in the gas-phase. In this sense, one could suggest that the reaction in an enzyme environment has a lower activation barrier, just like the analogous reaction in the gas-phase (Fig. 3). Indeed, there are reactions accelerated by moving from polar to nonpolar solvents.35 However, reactions in nonpolar solvents are not the same as reactions in the active sites of an enzyme which is surrounded by a polar solvent. In addition, it is important to emphasize that the only way to test desolvation proposal is evaluating the binding energies of RS and TS in the protein and aqueous solution. Besides, analyzing only energetic diagrams (Fig. 3) for reactions in water and the gas-phase cannot provide the answers about the catalysis in the enzyme active sites, where there are key intermolecular interactions between the substrate and catalytic residues.",
        "Evaluating the reaction in water and proteins Despite significant advances in computational power, the use of a higher-level quantum mechanical approach remains cumbersome for modeling reactions in proteins, particularly if one is interested in obtaining convergent free energies.36 This problem is circum-vented by the EVB15 which is a semi-empirical method used to describe bond-breaking and bond-making processes.36 The EVB surface of proteins is calibrated using the experimental information for the reaction in aqueous solution which allowed us to explore the free energy surface in the chlorinase without the challenge of obtaining fully converging QM(ai)/MM. Therefore, using the reported values for the reaction in water3 (34.50 kcal molNone1) we obtain Dgzcage \u00bc 32:0 kcalmolNone1 for the reaction in solution, con-sidering the fact that the free energy costs of bringing the reacting fragment to the same solvent cage is around 2.5 kcal molNone1.8,9 For the reaction catalyzed by the native chlorinase1 we obtained Dgzcat \u00bc 20:12 kcalmolNone1 from the experimental data.1 The calculated activation energy for reactions in water and in the chlorinase is compared to the corresponding observed values described above summarized in Table 1. The calculated activation free energies for reactions in the protein and water are in a reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental values. The free energy profiles for reactions in the enzyme and aqueous solution are presented in Fig. 4. To explore the source of the large enhancement produced by chlorinase, we have calculated the electrostatic energies of the RS and TS in both the protein and water environments. In the reaction",
        "studied here, the charge distributions change from localized charge at the RS to delocalized charge at the TS, where we have +1 (SAM+), None1 (ClNone) for the RS and +0.73,None0.73 for the TS (Mulliken charges for the reaction in solution). In this sense, it would be difficult for the enzyme dipole to solvate the TS more than the RS and it would be even more difficult to obtain sufficient solvation by the solvent dipoles in the reference reaction. The solvation energies of the RS and TS in the protein and in water were calculated using the LRA approach. The electrostatic interactions between the substrate and its surrounding for RS and TS are depicted in Table 2, where hUQ None U0iQ correspond to trajectories where the substrate charges exist for the environment and hUQ None U0i0 correspond to trajectories where the substrate charges do not exist for the environment. As can be seen from Table 2, the protein solvates the RS more than water does, taking",

        "Analyzing the reaction in the Y70T mutant We also evaluated the catalytic effect of Y70T mutation in chlorinase. Eusta\u0301quio and co-workers1 have reported kinetic parameters for the formation of 50-ClDA and L-methionine in the chlorinase Y70T mutant, using their reported value, we estimated Dgzexp \u00bc 24:4 kcalmolNone1 for the reaction catalyzed by this protein mutant. In accordance with the desolvation idea the polarity of the native enzyme active sites would be less effective than in its Y70T mutant because active site residues desolvate the reacting fragments and thus improve the catalytic efficiency in native. However, in accordance with our computa-tional simulations we note that the difference in the catalytic effect of the native and mutant is almost entirely due to the difference in the electrostatic contribution to the activation barrier. Here the electrostatic stabilization of ClNone in the RS and TS in the native is larger than in the mutant enzyme and this leads to a larger activation barrier in the mutant. Therefore, the polarity of the native enzyme active sites is more effective in native than in its Y70T mutant which implies that desolvation cannot enhance the rate of reaction for native, since the native solvates better ClNone than the mutant does. Chlorinase Y70T mutation increases g which is supported by the idea that preoriented dipoles in an enzyme can account for catalysis. It",
        "is important to note that solvation energies of the RS and TS can be obtaining by the sum of the solvation energies of the reacting fragment (SAM+ + ClNone).

However, it is also important to mention that due to the size of SAM+, the changes in solvation energy for this cation are lower than for ClNone (see Table S5, ESI\u2020). It is likely that much more extensive sampling would improve the results for the mutational effect. However, this is not the purpose of the present work. Here, we have focused on the results obtained for the chloride anion. It is worth mentioning that there are more apolar residues present in the active sites of chlorinase than polar residues (see Fig. 5). Despite the apolar character inside the pocket of chlorinase. The key residues are positioned in order to create an optimal electrostatic environment for stabilizing the nega-tive charge of chloride ions. For example, Gly131 is an apolar residue. On the other hand, chloride ions form hydrogen bonds with the amide backbone of Gly131 (2.8 \u00c5) as well as an internal water molecule and a threonine residue in the active sites of chlorinase (see Fig. 6). Interestingly, experimental data show that replacement of Gly131 with a serine led to the loss of SalL halogenase activity.1 Despite that, chlorinase acts on its substrates without assistance of metals or polar residues.

        "enzyme uses key active site interactions that optimally stabilize the transition state during the reaction. In the case of chlorinase, strong hydrogen bond interactions between Gly131 and ClNone and pre oriented dipoles in its active sites are sufficient to account for the rate enhancements achieved by this enzyme that manages to stabilize the system by hydrogen bonds (dipoles) which are especially aligned towards the negatively charged chloride. Therefore, our computational results did not find that SAM dependent halide alkylating enzymes catalyze their reaction by the desolvation of ClNone in the active sites of chlorinase. We found here that in the related case of chlorinase ClNone is more stable in the enzyme than in water. Thus, the catalytic effect of chlorinase appears to result mainly from electrostatic interactions that \u2018\u2018solvate\u2019\u2019 ClNone in the enzyme more effectively than in solution which is in agreement with the electrostatic idea.28",
        "Conclusion In principle, desolvation proposal and the electrostatic preor-ganization effect cannot be evaluated without computational modeling. Here, we have addressed the main point raised in a recent experimental study that has proposed that SAM depen-dent halide alkylating enzymes catalyze their reaction through a desolvation mechanism. Desolvation proposal suggests that enzymes work by moving polar or charged reacting fragments to a non-polar environment and thus destabilizing the ground state. However, in the case of the reaction catalyzed by chlorinase, we found that the RS is more stable in the enzyme than in water and that thus the desolvation idea does not apply to catalysis of alkyl transfer from SAM to halide ions. In fact, it is well known that a nonpolar solvent can accelerate SN2 reactions. However, only the observation that some reactions are accelerated upon moving from polar to nonpolar solvents cannot support the idea that an enzyme accelerates its catalysis reaction by resembling the corresponding gas-phase reaction. It is important to point out that substrates",
        "make key intermolecular interactions with residues in the active sites of enzymes and such interactions stabilize the RS. Further-more, the difference between the solvation free energy of the RS and TS is smaller in the protein (B19 kcal molNone1) than in the water solution (B32 kcal molNone1), which explains the large catalytic effect in the enzyme, where there is a preferential stabilization of the less-polar TS. Our results also show that chlorinase solvates ClNone more than water does, which is critical for the RS and TS electrostatic stabilization. In summary, the analysis described in this manu-script indicates that SAM-dependent chlorinase does not use the desolvation mechanism, but provides the electrostatic stabilization of chloride ions necessary for catalysis.",
