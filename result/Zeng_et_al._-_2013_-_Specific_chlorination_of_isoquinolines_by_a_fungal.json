Based on the reportedstructure of the bacterial halogenase CmlS, we have built a homology model for Rdc2. The modelsuggests an open substrate binding site that is capable of binding the natural substrate, monocillinII, and possibly other molecules such as 4-hydroxyisoquinoline (1) and 6-hydroxyisoquinoline (2).In vitro and in vivo halogenation experiments confirmed that 1 and 2 can be halogenated at theposition ortho to the hydroxyl group, leading to the synthesis of the chlorinated isoquinolines 1aand 2a, respectively, which further expands the spectrum of identified substrates of Rdc2. Thiswork revealed that Rdc2 is a useful biocatalyst for the synthesis of various halogenatedcompounds. Keywords Fungal halogenase; Flavin-dependent; Homology model; Isoquinolines; Substrate specificityHalogenated molecules are an important group of natural products because of theirsignificant biological activities. Up to now, more than 4,500 halogenated compounds havebeen isolated from nature,1, 2 such as rebeccamycin, chloramphenicol and vancomycin.Recently, biological halogenation has drawn more and more attention as a highly selectiveand efficient substitute for classical organic chemistry approaches.3, 4 Consequently,discovery of novel halogenases with broad substrate specificity from natural productbiosynthetic pathways is critical. Our group has recently discovered a promising halogenaseRdc2 that is involved in radicicol biosynthesis in Pochonia chlamydosporia.5 This enzymespecifically chlorinates at C-6 of monocillins such as monocillin II, a biosynthetic precursorof radicicol, as shown in Fig. 1. We have found that this enzyme can also work on othersimilar macrolactones such as dihydroresorcylide. This enzyme can catalyze both mono-anddichlorination. Additionally, it also accepts bromide as a halogen donor to conduct bothmono-and dibromination.5 Taken these unique promising properties together, this enzymehas shown great potential as a powerful halogenating biocatalyst. Thus, we decided tofurther study this enzyme to understand its structure and test its applicability to other types\u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.*Corresponding author.

In this work, we report a homology model of Rdc2 for substrate docking andchlorination of two isoquinolines by this enzyme.Several structures of bacterial flavin-dependent halogenases have been reported, such asPrnA (AAB97504),6 RebH (CAC93722)7 and CmlS (AAK08979).8 Both PrnA and RebHare tryptophan 7-halogenase, involved in the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin and rebeccaymcin,respectively, while CmlS is characterized from the biosynthetic pathway ofchloramphenicol. We constructed a homology model of Rdc2 using the LOMETS server.9 The highest scoredsolution was based on the crystal structure of CmlS (pdb ID 3i3l), using MUSTER10 toperform the threading alignment and MODELLER11 to build the final structure. The modelcontains 505 residues, which corresponds to 94.7% of the Rdc2 sequence. The final modelcontains an N-terminal flavin monooxygenase domain and a C-terminal \u201cwinged-helix\u201ddomain (Fig. 2A). Additional models produced by the server vary in the C-terminal domainbut show strong agreement in the N-terminal domain.The putative substrate binding site is located in a hydrophobic region of the N-terminaldomain adjacent to the strictly conserved K74. The Rdc2 substrate monocillin II wasmodeled into the structure using a superimposed PrnA structure bound to 7-chlorotryptophan (PDB ID 2AR8) as a guide (Fig. 2B). The model suggests an open bindingsite that may accommodate a variety of compounds, raising the possibility that Rdc2 may beable to utilize various substrates.To further expand the substrate spectrum and the application of Rdc2, we tested the abilityof Rdc2 to chlorinate isoquinoline substrates. Isoquinoline is a common structuralcomponent of many bioactive natural products, such as renieramycin M from Xestospongiasp. and jorunnamycin C from Jorunnafunebris, both having promising anticancer activitywith IC50 values in the nanomolar range.12 In this paper, we chose two typical isoquinolines,4-hydroxyisoquinoline (1) and 6-hydroxyisoquinoline (2), to test whether Rdc2 couldchlorinate this important type of molecule. As shown in Fig. 2C and 2D, both compoundscan fit into the active site of Rdc2 and thus represent potential substrates for this enzyme.We then conducted in vitro enzymatic assays to examine whether they can really bechlorinated by Rdc2. Rdc2 and the partner flavin reductase Fre from Escherichia coli wereexpressed and purified as previously reported.5 As shown in Fig. 3, LC-MS analysisrevealed that both reactions13 yielded a product peak with lower polarity. ESI-MS revealedthat both 1a and 2a had two [M+H]+ ion peaks with a 3:1 ratio in the positive mode (datanot shown), which is a characteristic of monochlorinated molecules. 1 and 2 are isomerswith a molecular weight of 145, while the molecular weight of both 1a and 2a is 179, whichis 34 Da greater than the substrates, indicating that they are the chlorinated products.In order to obtain sufficient amounts of 1a and 2a for structure elucidation to characterizethe chlorination positions, we used an in vivo biocatalytic approach. A total of 30 mg of 1and 2 were separately fed into the isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducedfermentation broth of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL/pJZ54 to yield 8.5 mg of 1a and11.4 mg of 2a, respectively.14The purified products were dissolved in methanol-d4 and the NMR spectra were acquired ona JEOL instrument (300 MHz). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1a showed two doublet and twotriplet signals that belong to H-5, H-6, H-7 and H-8, indicating that the halogenation has notoccurred on the benzene ring. In contrast, only one singlet was observed for the pyridinering, suggesting that either C-1 or C-3 is halogenated. The chemical shift of this signal is \u03b48.64, which belongs to H-1. Thus, we can deduce that the halogenation occurred at C-3Zeng et al.Page 2Bioorg Med Chem Lett. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 February 15.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript position, which is ortho to the hydroxyl group. Thus, 1a was identified as 3-chloro-4-hydroxyisoquinoline. To determine the chlorination position in 2a, both 1H and 1H-1H COSY spectra wererecorded. As expected, there were only five proton signals in the 1H NMR spectrum,confirming that one proton has been substituted by Cl. The 1H-1H COSY correlations of H-3to H-4 as well as H-7 to H-8 clearly revealed that these protons are not chlorinated.Meanwhile, the signal of H-1 can be easily located in the low field at \u03b4 9.53, indicating thatC-5 of 2 has been chlorinated, which is also ortho to the hydroxyl group. Therefore, 2a wascharacterized as 5-chloro-6-hydroxyisoquinoline. The 1H NMR signals of both products areshown in Table 1.Almost all the previously characterized flavin-dependent halogenases are highly substratespecific, such as those reported tryptophan halogenases.15\u201318 In order to develop a usefulhalogenating biocatalyst, an enzyme with broad substrate specificity is needed. Rdc2 is ahalogenase different from those previously reported. It is a late tailoring enzyme in radicicolbiosynthesis and can halogenate other macrolactones besides its natural substratesmonocillins.5 In this work, we report a homology model of the first identified fungal flavin-dependent halogenase Rdc2, which predicts that this enzyme can accommodate varioussubstrates. We demonstrated that Rdc2 can function on another important group ofmolecule, isoquinolines. This is the first report of enzymatic synthesis of chlorinatedisoquinolines. Structural characterization of 1a and 2a indicated that the chlorine atom hasbeen introduced at the position ortho to the hydroxyl group. A hydroxyl group is a stronglyactivating substituent. The resonance effect of the hydroxyl group directs the electrontoward the ring and may contribute to the chlorination of the ortho position. Furtherinvestigation of the Xray structure of Rdc2 will reveal more information about the catalyticmechanism of this enzyme, which will allow us to use the structure model to find morepotential substrates. Moreover, this research also demonstrated a convenient and effectiveway to prepare halogenated molecules with Rdc2. In vitro enzymatic reaction allows a quickscreening of the substrates and initial analysis of the products, while in vivo biocatalysisthrough engineered E. coli provides an economic way to obtain sufficient amounts ofhalogenated products on a large scale for structure elucidation and bioactivity studies.Acknowledgments This work was partly supported by a Utah Science Technology and Research (USTAR) Veterinary Diagnostics andInfectious Disease Seed Project and a National Institutes of Health grant (AI065357).

A 100-\u00b5L halogenation assay consisted of 100 \u00b5M FAD, 10 mM NADH, 0.1 mM 1 or 2, 10 mMNaCl, 16 \u00b5M Fre, and 16 \u00b5M Rdc2 in100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The reaction mixtureswere placed at 30\u00b0C for 5 h and then quenched by addition of 50 \u00b5L of methanol. The mixtureswere then subjected to analysis on an Agilent 6130 LC-MS instrument using a Zorbax SB-C18 (5\u00b5m, 4.6 \u00d7 150 mm). A gradient of acetonitrile/H2O system (10\u201390% over 25 min) containing 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was programmed for the analysis.14. 30 mg of 1 was fed into the IPTG induced fermentation broth of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL/pJZ54 that expresses Rdc2. The culture was maintained at 28\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm for36 h. The ethyl acetate extract of the broth was fractionated on a Sephadex LH-20 (20 g) columneluted with methanol to give 14 fractions, 5 mL each. Fractions 3~6 were combined and furtherseparated by reverse-phase HPLC (Eclipse XDB-C18 column, 5 \u00b5m, 4.6 \u00d7 150 mm) with isocraticelution of 25% acetonitrile in H2O (each containing 0.1% TFA) for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min to yield 8.5 mg of 1a. Similarly, 30 mg of 2 was also incubated with E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL/pJZ54 under the same conditions. The ethyl acetate extract was fractionated on aDiaion HP-20 (30 g) column eluted with a stepwise gradient of isopropanol-water (0:100, 20:80,40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0, each 250 mL) to give 6 fractions. Further separation of fraction 3 byreverse-phase HPLC with isocratic elution of 10% acetonitrile in H2O (each containing 0.1%TFA) over 20 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min afforded 11.4 mg of 2a in pure form.15.

[PubMed: 8254673]12. Charupant K, Suwanborirux K, Daikuhara N, Yokoya M, Ushijima-Sugano R, Kawai T, Owa T,Saito N. Mar. Drugs. 2009; 7:483. [PubMed: 20098592]13. A 100-\u00b5L halogenation assay consisted of 100 \u00b5M FAD, 10 mM NADH, 0.1 mM 1 or 2, 10 mMNaCl, 16 \u00b5M Fre, and 16 \u00b5M Rdc2 in100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The reaction mixtureswere placed at 30\u00b0C for 5 h and then quenched by addition of 50 \u00b5L of methanol. The mixtureswere then subjected to analysis on an Agilent 6130 LC-MS instrument using a Zorbax SB-C18 (5\u00b5m, 4.6 \u00d7 150 mm). A gradient of acetonitrile/H2O system (10\u201390% over 25 min) containing 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was programmed for the analysis.14. 30 mg of 1 was fed into the IPTG induced fermentation broth of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL/pJZ54 that expresses Rdc2. The culture was maintained at 28\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm for36 h. The ethyl acetate extract of the broth was fractionated on a Sephadex LH-20 (20 g) columneluted with methanol to give 14 fractions, 5 mL each. Fractions 3~6 were combined and furtherseparated by reverse-phase HPLC (Eclipse XDB-C18 column, 5 \u00b5m, 4.6 \u00d7 150 mm) with isocraticelution of 25% acetonitrile in H2O (each containing 0.1% TFA) for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min to yield 8.5 mg of 1a. Similarly, 30 mg of 2 was also incubated with E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL/pJZ54 under the same conditions. The ethyl acetate extract was fractionated on aDiaion HP-20 (30 g) column eluted with a stepwise gradient of isopropanol-water (0:100, 20:80,40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0, each 250 mL) to give 6 fractions. Further separation of fraction 3 byreverse-phase HPLC with isocratic elution of 10% acetonitrile in H2O (each containing 0.1%TFA) over 20 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min afforded 11.4 mg of 2a in pure form.15.
