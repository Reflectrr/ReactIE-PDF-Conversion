An enzyme extracted from marine red algae, Bonnemaisonia hamifera, is capable of incorporating bromine into a number of organic substrates in the pH range 5 to 8. At pH 7.3, incubation ofpartially purified preparations ofbromoperoxi-dase with hydrogen peroxide, bromide ion, and 3-oxooctanoic acid leads to the for-mation of three volatile brominated hydrocarbons: dibromomethane, bromoform, and 1-pentyl bromide. The presence of significant quantities of halometabolites in-cluding volatile halohydrocarbons in marine organisms, ocean waters, and the upper atmosphere may result from peroxidase-catalyzed halogenation reactions. During an expedition of the research vessel Alpha Helix to Baja, California, in 1974, more than 1000 samples of marine organisms were collected and assayed for halometabolites (1). This work dem-onstrated the widespread occurrence of r-1 organic compounds containing bromine and chlorine and indicated that expanded studies on the chemistry of marine natu-ral products would lead to the discovery and characterization of many new halo-metabolites.

These compounds include a diverse array of halogenated terpenes, hydrocarbons, and phenols (2, 3). Recently, members of the family Bonnemaisoniaceae (Nemaliales) have been shown to produce a variety of ha-logenated ketones (4-6). Dibromo-, tri-bromo-, and tetrabromo-2-heptanones and bromoiodo-2-heptanones have been isolated from the odorous alga Bonne-maisonia hamifera. One objective of our study of marine halometabolites has been to examine the mechanisms responsible for the biosyn-thesis and metabolism of these com-pounds. We have assumed that the bio-genesis of marine halometabolites must encompass halogenation reactions simi-lar to those of chloroperoxidase (7). Chloroperoxidase, which has been puri-fied from the fungus Caldariomyces fu-mago, is capable of introducing iodine, bromine, and chlorine atoms into organic molecules through an electrophilic sub-stitution mechanism (8). In this study we examined biological halogenation reac-tions in B. hamifera. Crude extracts of this organism exhibit a powerful enzy-matic brominating activity (9). Samples ofB. hamifera were collected in the vicinity of Punta Mejia off the northernmost point of Isla Angel de la Guarda in the Gulf of California in March 1974 and were stored at -20\u00b0C.

The pH optimum for bromination of monochlo-rodimedon 'was 5.4; however, the opti-mum may. vary depending on the nature of the acceptor molecule. Various nucleophilic substrates have been examined as potential halogen ac-ceptors in the synthesis of halometabo-lites by bromoperoxidase. Since bro-minated heptanones are the major natu-ral halogen-containing compounds pro-duced by B. hamifera (4), the ~-keto\u00ad acids, 3-oxooctanoic acid, and 3-oxohex-anoic acid were examined for acceptor activity.: By analogy to chloroperoxidase reac-tions, the following reaction sequence could be visualized for the formation of brominated heptanones from 3-oxoocta-noic acid, o II Enz-Br+ + H02C-CH2-C-(CH2)4-CH3~ o II CO2 + Br-CH2-C-(CH2)4-CH3 + H+ (2) o .

Various nucleophiles were examined as halogen acceptors by incubation with bromoper-oxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and radio-active 77Br-(9). It was found that ~-keto:\" acids and cyclic ~-diketones were partic-ularly good acceptors, whereas sub-stituted phenols were significantly less effective (9). To analyze the exact chemical struc-ture of the enzymatically synthesized halometabolites, reactions were carried out in vitro with 3-oxooctanoic acid as a substrate. Reaction mixtures contained 0.8 mmole of potassium phosphate-cit-rate buffer, 1 mmole of Br-, 50 ILmole of 3-oxooctanoic acid, and 750 units (11) of bromoperoxidase in a total volume of 20 ml. The reaction was sustained by step-wise addition of 15 ILmole of H20 2 at 2-8 DECEMBER 1978 minute intervals for 60 minutes. The re-action mixtures were then extracted with three volumes of diethyl ether and. the organic phase was dried over MgS04. Ether solutions were concentrated at 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0C to a small volume (0.1 to 0.3 ml). Reaction products were analyzed .and identified with the aid of a Varian MAT 311A mass spectrometer intenaced with a Varian model 2700 gas chromatograph. When the bromoperoxidase reaction was carried out at pH 5.6 and the products were chromatographed on glass columns (6 or 12 feet long; inner diameter, 2 mm) containing 3 percent OV-Ion Supelco-port 80-100, both I-bromo-2-heptanone and 1; I-dibromo-2-heptanone were con-firmed as major reaction products (12). 2-Heptanone and trace amounts of 1,1,1-tribromoheptanone were also present in the reaction mixture. The formation of tribromoheptanone as a product of the bromoperoxidase reaction encouraged us to search for conditions that would support the enzymatic synthesis of bromoform since the cleavage of tri-haloketones at a carbon-carbon bond is known to occur under basic conditions. In the bromoperoxidase reaction the tri-bromoheptanone could yield bromoform and caproic acid according to o II Br3C-C-(CH2)4-CH3 + OH-~. o II HCBr3 + CH3-(CH2)4-C-0 -(5) To detect the formation of volatile halo-forms, bromoperoxidase was incubated in vitro with 3-oxooctanoic acid, hydro-gen peroxide, and bromide ion at several pH values. Volatile halocarborts were re-solved and detected by gas chromatogra-phy of ether extracts of the reaction mix-ture followed by mass spectral analysis. These experiments showed the absence of detectable quantities of bromoform in the reactions at pH 5.6. However, gas chromatography of ether extracts of the reaction mixture after incubation of bro-moperoxidase at pH 6.6 showed tri-bromomethane (Fig. 1, peak A). At pH 7.3 both dibromomethane (Fig..1, peak B) and tribromomethane (peak C) were produced in significant quantities. Anal-ysis of peak heights on the gas chroma-tography trace indicated that the ratio of tribromo-to dibromomethane was about 10:1 atpH 7.3. The mass spectral analysis of peak B (Fig. 2) shows the molecular ions of di-bromomethane [mass-to-charge ratio (m/e) 172, 174, and 176] split into the typ-ical 1:2: 1 distribution by the bromine isotopes of m/e 79 and 81. Strong ion in-tensities at mfe 94 and 96 show the pres-ence of ion fragments CH279Br+ and CH281Br+. The mass spectral analysis of pe.ak C shows the molecular ions of brpmoform (m/e 249, 251, 253, and 255) in a ratio of 1:3:3:1. Strong ion intensities at m/e 171, 173, and 175 show the presence of ion frag-ments 79BrCH79Br+, 79BrCH81Br+, and 81BrCH81Br+, respectively. In addition to the brominated meth-anes, the analysis revealed the presence of athird volatile brominated derivative (Fig. 1, peak D). This unknown com-pound has been identified \u00b7as pentyl bro-mUle on the basis of a comparison of the mass spectral properties of the unknown peak with those of authentic pentyl bro-mide. The mass spectral analysis of peak D (Fig. 2) shows the molecular ions of pentyl bromide at m/e 150 and 152. The enzymatic formation of dibromo-methane, bromoform, and pentyl bro-mide from 3-oxooctanoic acid can be ra-tionalized on the basis of multiple halo-genations on both of the carbon atoms alpha to the ketone. Multiple bromina-tion followed by hydrolysis could then give rise to. the observed mixture of brominated derivatives. Dibromometh-ane and bromoform could arise from the hydrolysis of the brominated heptanones outlined in reactions 3 and 4. The pentyl bromide could arise from the hydrolysis of an oxooctanoic acid derivative that has been brominated in position 4. This reaction is o II CH3-(CH2)3-CHBr-C-CH2-COOH + H20 ~CH3-(CH2)3-CH2Br + HOOC-CH2-COOH (6) Further experimentation will be required to determine whether the hydrolytic re-action is enzyme-catalyzed or spontane-ous under the reaction conditions em-ployed. We propose that bromomethanes found in natural waters (13) and as con-stituents of at least one species of edible red algae (14, 15) are the products of en-zyme-catalyzed bromination of ketones. Since bromoperoxidase is also capable of oxidizing iodide, it is reasonable to as-sume that the enzyme can induce the synthesis of a number of iodomethanes that are known to occur in significant concentrations in ocean waters, (16). The reaction of iodo-or bromomethanes with chloride in seawater could also give rise to chloromethanes (17). In addition, Pe-dersen (18) reported the isolation from 1095 D ow nloaded from https://ww w .science.org at University of Illinois -Urbana on June 01, the red algae Cystoclonium purpurem of a peroxidase that can use both bromide and chloride as halogenation substrates. Peroxidases capable of oxidizing chlo-ride could give rise to chloromethanes by a mechanism similar to the bromoperoxi-dase reaction. Peroxidative halogenation with either I-, Br-, or Cl-is therefore re-sponsible not only for the synthesis of a wide variety of marine halometabolites but possibly also for contributing large quantities (16) of the more volatile ha-logenated hydrocarbons to ocean waters and the environment. In light of recent environmental concern over halohydro-carbon-catalyzed destruction of ozone (19), it would be important to measure the production of halocarbons by marine organisms and compare it with industrial halocarbon production.

The relative frequency of appearance of discontinuities in the post-synaptic thickening, or perforations in the subsynaptic plate, increased with age and experience. Rats rearedfrom weaning in complex or social environments had a sig-nificantly higher proportion of occipital cortical synapses with perforations than did rats reared in isolation. In addition, the relativefrequency ofthese perforations more than tripled between 10 and 60 days of age. Shifts in the frequency ofperforations can occur independently of changes in the size of synapses. This result suggests a new potential mechanism of synaptic plasticity. Synapses in certain layers of the oc-cipital cortex have longer postsynaptic thickenings in rats reared under environ-mental complexity (EC) than those reared under impoverished conditions in normal laboratory cages (IC) (1, 2). The thickenings were measured because they reflected the area of the synaptic contact and thus, possibly, synaptic efficacy. In these studies, we measured along the length of the thickenings, ignoring the gaps which sometimes appeared in them, as seen in Fig. 1. Peters and Kaiserman-Abramof (3) used serial sections to demonstrate that, in the third dimension, these gaps in the postsynaptic thickening corresponded to irregularly shaped perforations in a sub-synaptic plate; they also found that these subsynaptic plate perforations (SSPP's) were more frequent in larger plates. We were intrigued by their suggestion that the edge of the subsynaptic plate might be the active site of the synapse and, thus, that perforations in the plate might functionally strengthen the synapse. Given this different possible anatomical measure of synaptic efficacy, we decided to analyze the percentage of synapses in which these SSPP's appeared in our EC and IC rats (1). In reanalyzing data from these animals, in new data from socially housed (SC) animals, and in a new group of EC-SC-IC triplet sets, we have noted that the percentage of occipital cortex synapses in which SSPP's appear is af-fected by the postweaning environment of the animal and that the frequency of SSPP's may vary independently of the size of the synapse. In addition, the fre-quency of SSPP's increased with age in a third study. To our knowledge, the re-sults reported here are the first experi-mental evidence that SSPP's might have a functional role. The initial observation involved four littermate pairs of male Long Evans hooded rats in which postsynaptic thick-ening differences were previously de-scribed (1). One member of each pair had been reared under EC and the other un-der IC. We compared the rate of occur-rence of SSPP's of the type shown in Fig. I in round vesicle, asymmetric syn-apses (4) of layer 4 of the occipital cor-tex, in which the greatest and most con-sistent difference in the length of the postsynaptic thickening occurs (1, 2). In this layer, an unweighted mean of 18.8 percent [standard error of the mean (S.E.M.)= 1.4 percent] of these syn-apses in EC animals contained SSPP's visible in transverse section, whereas only 11.9 percent (S.E.M. = 2.4 percent) of these synapses in the IC animals con-tained SSPP's. Each of the four EC rats had a higher percentage than its IC litter-mate [F (1, 6) = 5.96; P -.05]. Table 1.

To analyze the exact chemical struc-ture of the enzymatically synthesized halometabolites, reactions were carried out in vitro with 3-oxooctanoic acid as a substrate.

The formation of tribromoheptanone as a product of the bromoperoxidase reaction encouraged us to search for conditions that would support the enzymatic synthesis of bromoform since the cleavage of tri-haloketones at a carbon-carbon bond is known to occur under basic conditions.

        "Subsynaptic Plate Perforations: Changes with Age and Experience in the Rat",
        "Abstract. The relative frequency of appearance of discontinuities in the post-synaptic thickening, or perforations in the subsynaptic plate, increased with age and experience. Rats rearedfrom weaning in complex or social environments had a sig-nificantly higher proportion of occipital cortical synapses with perforations than did rats reared in isolation. In addition, the relativefrequency ofthese perforations more than tripled between 10 and 60 days of age. Shifts in the frequency ofperforations can occur independently of changes in the size of synapses. This result suggests a new potential mechanism of synaptic plasticity.",
        "Synapses in certain layers of the oc-cipital cortex have longer postsynaptic thickenings in rats reared under environ-mental complexity (EC) than those reared under impoverished conditions in normal laboratory cages (IC) (1, 2). The thickenings were measured because they reflected the area of the synaptic contact and thus, possibly, synaptic efficacy. In these studies, we measured along the length of the thickenings, ignoring the gaps which sometimes appeared in them, as seen in Fig. 1.",
        "Peters and Kaiserman-Abramof (3) used serial sections to demonstrate that, in the third dimension, these gaps in the postsynaptic thickening corresponded to irregularly shaped perforations in a sub-synaptic plate; they also found that these subsynaptic plate perforations (SSPP's) were more frequent in larger plates. We were intrigued by their suggestion that the edge of the subsynaptic plate might be the active site of the synapse and, thus, that perforations in the plate might functionally strengthen the synapse. Given this different possible anatomical measure of synaptic efficacy, we decided to analyze the percentage of synapses in which these SSPP's appeared in our EC and IC rats (1). In reanalyzing data from these animals, in new data from socially housed (SC) animals, and in a new group of EC-SC-IC triplet sets, we have noted that the percentage of occipital cortex synapses in which SSPP's appear is af-fected by the postweaning environment of the animal and that the frequency of SSPP's may vary independently of the size of the synapse. In addition, the fre-quency of SSPP's increased with age in a third study. To our knowledge, the re-sults reported here are the first experi-mental evidence that SSPP's might have a functional role.",
        "The initial observation involved four littermate pairs of male Long Evans hooded rats in which postsynaptic thick-ening differences were previously de-scribed (1). One member of each pair had been reared under EC and the other un-der IC. We compared the rate of occur-rence of SSPP's of the type shown in Fig. I in round vesicle, asymmetric syn-apses (4) of layer 4 of the occipital cor-tex, in which the greatest and most con-sistent difference in the length of the postsynaptic thickening occurs (1, 2). In this layer, an unweighted mean of 18.8 percent [standard error of the mean (S.E.M.)= 1.4 percent] of these syn-apses in EC animals contained SSPP's visible in transverse section, whereas only 11.9 percent (S.E.M. = 2.4 percent) of these synapses in the IC animals con-tained SSPP's. Each of the four EC rats had a higher percentage than its IC litter-mate [F (1, 6) = 5.96; P -.05].",
