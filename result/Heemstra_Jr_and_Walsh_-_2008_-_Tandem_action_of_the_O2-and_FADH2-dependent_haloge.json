Walsh*Department of Biological Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston,Massachusetts 02115Abstract Kutznerides are actinomycete-derived antifungal nonribosomal hexadepsipeptides which areassembled from five unsual nonproteinogenic amino acids and one hydroxy acid. Conserved in allstructurally characterized kutznerides is a dichlorinated tricyclic hexahydropyrroloindole postulatedto be derived from 6,7-dichlorotryptophan. In this communication, we identify KtzQ and KtzR astandem acting FADH2-dependent halogenases that work sequentially on free L-tryptophan to generate6,7-dichloro-L-tryptophan. Kinetic characterization of these two enzymes has shown that KtzQ (alongwith the flavin reductase KtzS) acts first to chlorinate at the 7-position of L-tryptophan. KtzR, witha ~120 fold preference for 7-chloro-L-tryptophan over L-tryptophan, then installs the second chlorineat the 6-position of 7-chloro-L-tryptophan to generate 6,7-dichloro-L-tryptophan. These findingsprovide further insights into the enzymatic logic of carbon-chloride bond formation during thebiosynthesis of halogenated secondary metabolites.Kutznerides are antifungal nonribosomal hexadepsipeptides produced by the soil actinomyceteKutzneria sp. 744.1 The macrolactone scaffold is assembled from six unusual building blocks.The lactone oxygen is derived from t-butylglycolate while the five amino acid monomers areall nonproteinogenic. In some kutznerides, e.g. kutzneride 2 (1) (Figure 1), there are twochlorinated residues, a tricyclic dihalogenated (2S,3aR,8aS)-6,7-dichloro-3a-hydroxy-hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid (diClPIC) and a \u03b3-chloro-piperazate. Inaddition, we previously suggested that the unusual 2-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-D-glycine(MecPG) residue might arise by cryptic chlorination of an isoleucyl side chain, setting upsubsequent closure to the \u03b2,\u03b3-cyclopropane.2,3 With the expectation that several halogenationevents are operative in kutneride biosynthesis, the cognizant gene cluster in kutzneria wasidentified by degenerate primer-based PCR amplication through the use of FADH2-dependentand nonheme FeII-dependent halogenase probes.2 Bioinformatic analysis indicated a putativeChristopher_Walsh@hms.harvard.edu.

Comparison to other known flavin halogenases revealed KtzQ shares 60% identitywith ThaL, a tryptophan 6-halogenase from Steptomyces albogriseolus,5 whereas KtzR shares54% identity with PyrH, a tryptophan 5-halogenase from Streptomyces rugosporus,6suggesting KtzQ and KtzR halogenate tryptophan prior to pyrroloindole formation. In thisstudy, we validate that purified KtzQ and KtzR are tandem acting halogenases that catalyzethe regiospecific dichlorination of L-tryptophan to produce 6,7-dichloro-L-tryptophan.To evaluate the role of the two putative O2-and FADH2-dependent 50 kDa halogenases, thektzQ and ktzR genes were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from Kutzneria sp. 744 andsubcloned for translation as N-terminally His6-tagged enzymes. Soluble protein (1.8 mg/Lculture) was obtained for the KtzQ construct when heterologously expressed in and purifiedfrom E.coli BL21 (DE3), whereas heterologous expression in Pseudeomonas putida KT2440was required to provide the KtzR construct in soluble form (1.1 mg/L culture). Both proteinswere obtained in over 90% purity after Ni-NTA affinity and gel exclusion chromatographies(Figure S1). The purified enzymes did not contain any cofactor with absorbance in the visiblerange of the spectrum. To provide the the FADH2 anticipated as substrate for the twohalogenases, KtzS was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), purified as the C-His6-taggedconstruct, and shown to be an NADH-utilizing FAD reductase. The previously characterizedE. coli NAD(P)H dependent flavin reductase SsuE was also prepared.7 Assays for halogenationwere conducted in the presence of soluble chloride ions with FAD, NADH and excess KtzSor SsuE to generate the diffusible FADH2 required for halogenase catalysis.KtzQ showed no activity for chlorination of piperazic acid or \u03b3,\u03b4-dehydropiperazic acid butwas active when incubated with L-Trp (Figure 2a) and yielded a product that comigrated withauthentic 7-chloro-L-tryptophan (7-Cl-L-Trp) by HPLC analysis. Mass analysis of the reactionproduct by ESI gave a pair of [M -H]-ions at m/z = 237.0 and 239.0 in a ~3:1 ratio, consistentwith a mono-chlorinated Trp compound (Figure S2). Comparison of the 1H-NMR data of theproduct and authentic 7-Cl-L-Trp further confirmed the site of chlorination at position 7 of theindole ring (Figure S3). When authentic 6-chloro-L-tryptophan (6-Cl-L-Trp) was tested assubstrate for KtzQ, a new peak appeared that coeluted with a chemically synthesized standardof 6,7-dichloro-L-tryptophan (6,7-diCl-L-Trp) (Figure 2b). ESI-MS analysis afforded three [M-H]-ions at m/z = 270.9, 272.9, and 274.9 in a ~10:6:1 ratio, consistent with a di-chlorinatedTrp compound (Figure S4).To gain further insight into the substrate specificity of KtzQ, kinetic studies were undertakenwith L-Trp and 6-Cl-L-Trp. At pH 7.0 under the coupled enzyme assay conditions (KtzS andKtzQ) the kcat for L-Trp to 7-Cl-L-Trp is 0.19 min-1 while for 6-Cl-L-Trp to 6,7-diCl-Trp thekcat is 0.07 min-1. The Km for both Trp and 6-Cl-Trp as substrates is \u22642 \u00b5M, at the sensitivitylimit of the assay. From these results we conclude KtzQ is a regiospecific tryptophan-7-halogenase which has a preference for halogenation at the 7 position of unmodified L-Trp butwill also take the 6-chloro-substrate.KtzR in turn also chlorinated L-Trp and the halogenated product comigrated with authentic 6-Cl-L-Trp (Figure 2c). The identity of the monochlorinated reaction product was furtherconfirmed by ESI-MS, yielding a pair of [M -H]-ions at m/z = 237.0 and 239.0 in a ~3:1 ratio(Figure S5). When presented with 7-Cl-L-Trp as a halogenation substrate, KtzR was again aHeemstra and WalshPage 2J Am Chem Soc.

Theproduct identity was also confirmed by ESI-MS ([M -H]-m/z = 270.9, 272.9, and 274.9)(figure S6). Comparison of 1H-NMR data of the product and authentic 6,7-diCl-L-Trpconfirmed the site of chlorination at position 6 of the indole ring (Figure S7). Remarkably, thecatalytic efficiency for halogenation of position 6 of 7-Cl-L-Trp was better than for L-Trp itself.The kcat ratio for 7-Cl-L-Trp/L-Trp as substrate (1.4 min-1/0.08 min-1) favors 7-Cl-L-Trp by~18 fold, and the Km value for 7-Cl-L-Trp at 114 \u00b5M is ~7 fold lower than for L-Trp at 808 \u00b5M,thus the presence of a chloride at the 7-position of the indole ring results in a ~120-fold increasein KtzR efficiency relative to umodified L-Trp. KtzR, like KtzQ, was not active for introductionof chloride to piperazic acid or \u03b3,\u03b4-dehydropiperazic acid.Tandem incubations of L-Trp with KtzQ and KtzR along with the flavin reductase KtzS or SsuEand NADH and FAD yielded the 6,7-diCl-L-Trp product (Figure 2e). From these results andthe individual enzyme kinetics, we conclude that the tandemly organized ktzQ and ktzR genesencode two FADH2-dependent halogenases that work sequentially on free L-Trp in the orderof KtzQ followed by KtzR to form 6,7-diCl-L-Trp (Figure 1B). It is then likely that 6,7-diCl-L-Trp is the monomer incorporated into the growing kutzneride assembly line by the KtzHadenylation domain. The final conversion to the diClPIC moiety in mature kutzneride ispostulated to be achieved by epoxidation of the indole 2,3-double bond by the hemeproteinKtzM with intramolecular capture of the epoxide by the amide nitrogen.2KtzQ is a regiospecific tryptophan-7-halogenase analogous to the enzymes RebH8 andPrnA9 that act in the first steps of rebeccamycin and pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis, respectively.The regioselectivity for introduction of chlorine at the 6-position of the indole ring of L-Trpand 7-Cl-L-Trp renders KtzR a homolog of ThaL6 in the thienodolin pathway. ThaL has aturnover of 2.8 min-1 while the Trp-7-halogenases PrnA and RebH perform at 0.1 to 1.4chlorinations per minute; these values are within range of those measured for KtzQ and KtzR.The kcat values may be faster in vivo if enzyme complexes exist to channel the FADH2 andresultant FAD(C4a)-OOH towards productive chlorination (via generation of HOCl, which isproposed to affect N-chlorination of an active-site lysine side chain to form lysine chloramineas the proximal halogenating species)9c vs competing autoxidation to FAD.Whereas KtzQ is analogous to all of the previously characterized tryptophan halogenases inits prefence for unmodified L-Trp, KtzR is novel in that it has a ~120 fold prefence for 7-Cl-L-Trp over L-Trp. The substrate binding site in KtzQ is well conserved with PrnA, RebH, ThaLand PyrH and all of the amino acids responsible for binding tryptophan are present. In contrast,two aromatic residues which stack against the indole ring of tryptophan in the PrnA and RebHstructures, H101 and W455 in PrnA and H109 and W466 in RebH, are replaced with glutamineand leucine residues respectively in KtzR (Table S1). Structural analysis is warranted todetermine if and then how these changes in the active site residues allow KtzR to differentiate7-Cl-L-Trp from L-Trp.In summary, our initial characterization of the three enzymes KtzQRS make it likely that theregioselective double halogenation in kutzneride biosynthesis occurs on free L-Trp bysequential action of the KtzQR pair. Kinetic characterization shows KtzQ acts first to chlorinateat the 7-position of L-Trp and then KtzR installs the second chlorine at the 6-position of 7-Cl-L-Trp to generate 6,7-diCl-L-Trp. Thus, while KtzD, Q, and R are now characterizedhalogenases, the chlorination of the piperazate moiety has not yet been accounted for and mayrequire further genomic analysis of the Kutzneria producer.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Heemstra and WalshPage 3J Am Chem Soc.

Structural analysis is warranted todetermine if and then how these changes in the active site residues allow KtzR to differentiate7-Cl-L-Trp from",
        "L-Trp.In summary, our initial characterization of the three enzymes KtzQRS make it likely that theregioselective double halogenation in kutzneride biosynthesis occurs on free L-Trp bysequential action of the KtzQR pair. Kinetic characterization shows KtzQ acts first to chlorinateat the 7-position of L-Trp and then KtzR installs the second chlorine at the 6-position of 7-Cl-L-Trp to generate 6,7-diCl-L-Trp. Thus, while KtzD, Q, and R are now characterizedhalogenases, the chlorination of the piperazate moiety has not yet been accounted for and mayrequire further genomic analysis of the Kutzneria",
