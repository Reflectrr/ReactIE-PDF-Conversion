Agardh and Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty, which are impor-tant industrial sources of the polysaccharide carrageenan. Notably, the purification of bromoperoxidase was difficult because due to the coexistence of viscoid polysaccharides. The activity of the partially purified enzyme was dependent on the vanadate ion, and displayed a distinct substrate spectrum from that of previously reported vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases of marine macroalgae. The enzyme was specific for BrNone and INone ions and inactive toward FNone and ClNone. The Km values for Br None and H2O2 were 2.5 \u00b7 10None3 M and 8.5 \u00b7 10None5 M, respectively. The halogenated product, dibromoacetaldehyde, that accumulated in K. alvarezii was additionally determined. None 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction Halogenated compounds are synthesized by several marine algae with the aid of haloperoxidases. These com-pounds are classified into indoles, terpenes, acetogenins, phenols, and volatile halogenated hydrocarbons (Faulkner, 2000, 2001, 2002). Halogenated marine metabolites gener-ally possess biological antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities (Cowan, 1999). Some additionally function as allelochemicals in the marine envi-ronment (Sakata et al., 1991; Denboh et al., 1997; Ohsawa et al., 2001). 0031-9422/$ -see front matter None 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

E-mail address: itoh@pu-toyama.ac.jp (N. Itoh). While the biosynthesis of halogenated marine natural products has intrigued scientists for decades, the mecha-nism has remained unclear to date (Littlechild et al., 2002). Haloperoxidases generally oxidize a halide anion (XNone) into a halonium cation (X+) with H2O2, and the X + and its related species (XOH, X2, X None 3 ) generated acts on many organic substrates as an electrophile (Yamada et al., 1985a; Itoh et al., 1988). The enzymes are divided into three groups, specifically, heme types (eukaryotic heme types and bacterial types containing protoporphylin IX as a prosthetic group) (Morris and Hager, 1966; Manthey and Hager, 1981), bacterial non-metal enzymes (perhydrolase) (van Pee et al., 1997; Kawanami et al., 2002) and eukary-otic vanadium-containing enzymes (Itoh et al., 1986; Ohs-awa et al., 2001; Krenn et al., 1989). Bacterial non-metal enzymes are related to the esterases and lipases because they contain the representative catalytic triad (Itoh et al., 2001).

Kamenarska et al. / Phytochemistry 68 (2007) 1358\u20131366 1359 Vanadium-containing bromoperoxidases (BPOs) spe-cific for BrNone and INone are widespread in marine macroalgae such as Corallina (Itoh et al., 1987a; Sheffield et al., 1993) and Ascophyllum (Vilter, 1984; Krenn et al., 1989; Butler, 1998). Some of these enzymes display low activity towards ClNone (Soedjak and Butler, 1990), and modification of enzyme can change the halide ion speci-ficity (Ohshiro et al., 2004). Although oxidation of bro-mide ion occurs at the active site in the case of vanadium-containing enzymes (Dau et al., 1999; Little-child et al., 2002), BPOs including Corallina generally do not display distinct substrate specificity or stereoselec-tivity (Itoh et al., 1987b, 1988; Soedjak and Butler, 1990). Recent studies show that flavin-dependent halogenases involved in chlorination of secondary metabolites in bac-teria catalyze the regioselective chlorination of trypto-phan or pyrrole derivatives (Dong et al., 2005; van Pee and Patallo, 2006). During screening, it was initially observed that specific samples of marine macroalgae belonging to the Solieria-ceae family, including Kappaphycus alvarezi (Doty) Doty, exhibited significant bromoperoxidase activity (Kam-enarska et al., 2006). K. alvarezii and its related algae are the basic source of carrageenan (a polysaccharide), which is commonly applied in the food industry and medicine. Owing to high commercial interest, K. alvarezii is widely cultivated in the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Tan-zania. Recently, tentative cultivation during the summer season was introduced in Shikoku Island, Southern Japan (Ohno et al., 1994). To date, most investigations on this alga focus on polysaccharide content and its properties (Ohno et al., 1996). Here, we report the properties of this novel BPO displaying distinct substrate specificity and its natural brominated compound was identified in K. alvarezii. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Distribution of BPO activity in marine algae As shown in the comparative data in Table 1, variable BPO activities were observed in a number of macroalgae belonging to the Solieriaceae family. To our knowledge, this is the first report on BPO activ-ity in these red algae, except for the previously documented Eucheuma denticulatum (Mtolera et al., 1996) and Meristi-ella gelidium (Collen et al., 1994) in the Solieriaceae. These produce volatile halogenated compounds when exposed to stress conditions, such as at an elevated pH and at high light intensities. The addition of KBr to the crude extracts of K. alvar-ezii during overnight dialysis led to improved stability. Moreover, enhanced stability and elevated activity was observed with increasing concentrations of KBr during dialysis (initial activity, 0.007 U/ml (100%), 0.1 mM KBr, 0.18 U/mg protein (129%); 0.5 mM KBr, 0.037 U/ml (529%); 1 mM KBr, 0.08 U/ml (1142%); and 5 mM KBr, 0.17 U/ml (2428%)), respectively. While the mecha-nism of activation by KBr is currently unclear, it is spec-ulated that the masked BPO activity is stimulated upon incubation with BrNone ions. KCl did not activate the enzyme. K. alvarezii was selected as the BPO source for further experiments, since its specific activity was high and biomass was available by aquaculture. The buffer was supplemented with 5 mM KBr and 0.5 mM NaVO3 throughout the isolation and purification of BPO, unless otherwise specified. 2.2. Enzyme purification Since BPO of K. alvarezii was stable in the presence of BrNone and vanadate ions, all purification procedures were performed at room temperature. BPO was extracted from the alga and partially purified using the procedures described in Section 4. The elimination of polysaccharide from crude enzyme by adding gel-forming agents to the enzyme solution, such as CaCl2 or KCl, led to a drastic loss in enzymatic activity, indicating that BPO was probably bound to polysaccharides. The activities of a number of enzymes were next examined that hydrolyze polysaccha-rides: LabiaseNone from Streptomyces fulvissimus, mainly con-taining N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase (Ohbuchi et al., 2001), was effective in decreasing the viscosity of crude extracts of K. alvarezii, but relatively ineffective in completely remov-ing polysaccharides from the enzyme solution. Thus, only partial purification of the enzyme was achieved. To purify the enzyme to homogeneity, further steps to completely hydrolyze the contaminating polysaccarides are essential, but this may lead to loss of enzyme activity. For this rea-son, complete purification of the enzyme was not attempted, and most experiments were performed with par-tially purified enzyme. The results of the purification are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 2. Lineweaver\u2013Burk plots for the bromination of MCD by BPO. (a) Plot with varying amounts of KBr, (b) plot with varying amounts of H2O2. The intersection of dashed line on abscissa indicates 1/Km.

Kamenarska et al. / Phytochemistry 68 (2007) 1358\u20131366 This enzyme preparation indicated some indistinct pro-tein bands on PAGE-gel, and the purity was roughly esti-mated to be less than 50% from Fig. 1. 2.3. Enzyme properties BPO of K. alvarezii catalyzed the bromination of mono-chlorodimedone (MCD) 1 in the presence of bromide ion (3.05 U/mg protein, 100%), i.e. the oxidation of BrNone to Br+ and its related species, but not chlorination or fluorina-tion. The enzyme also displayed strong oxidation activity towards INone to produce I2 (2.08 U/mg protein, 68%). Despite variable assay methods and activities, BPO activity for INone appeared to be comparable with that for BrNone. The influence of the KBr concentration on BPO activity was determined. A rise in enzymatic activity was observed with increasing KBr concentrations (from 0.5 to 20 mM). However, a decrease in activity (85% at 40 mM) was evi-dent at higher levels of KBr. Using the linear portion of the saturation curve, the Km value for Br None was calculated from Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot as 2.5 mM (Fig. 2a). The influence of the H2O2 concentrations was also deter-mined. The Km value was calculated as 8.5 \u00b7 10None5 M (Fig. 2b). Inhibition by H2O2 was detected at concentra-tions higher than 10 mM. The Km value for Br None was rather low, compared to that of previously studied BPOs, while that for H2O2 was comparable (1.1 \u00b7 10None2 M for BrNone, 9.2 \u00b7 10None5 M for H2O2 reported for C. pililifera BPO (pH 6.0) (Itoh et al., 1986), and 9.4 \u00b7 10None3 M for BrNone, 1.04 \u00b7 10None4 M for H2O2 by Ascophyllum nodosum BPO Fig. 1. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of partially purified BPO. About 10 lg of enzyme was subjected to electrophoresis. The gel was stained for protein (a) and for enzyme activity (b). The arrow indicates the position of BPO. (pH 5.9)) (Krenn et al., 1989). Catalase activity, which is common in heme type haloperoxidases, was not observed. BPO was active over a broad pH range, and the opti-mum pH was around at 6.5. Higher activity was observed with phosphate buffer at around pH 5.5 (Fig. 3). When the analysis was performed in acetate or MES buffer between pH 4.0 and 5.5, the activity was twice as low. These finding imply that both pH and type of buffer affects enzymatic activity. The presence of phosphate ions had a positive impact on BPO activity. Although the Fig. 3. pH optima of BPO. Enzyme activity was measured in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4\u20135) (h), potassium phosphate buffer (pH 4\u20137) (r), MES buffer (pH 5.5\u20137) (s) and Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7\u20138) (n). Z. Kamenarska et al. / Phytochemistry 68 (2007) 1358\u20131366 1361 vanadium-dependent BPOs are known to share similar active sites with some acid phosphatases (Ishikawa et al., 2000; Littlechild et al., 2002), the positive effect of phos-phate ions not negative on K. alvarezii BPO has been unclear. The effects of a range of compounds for crude enzyme, described in Section 4, were also determined. AgNO3, p-CMB, iodoacetic acid (sulfuhydryl reagents), and Na2MoO4, VOSO4, NaVO3, NaCl and EDTA did not affect the enzymatic activity. On the other hand, a number of divalent metal ions increased enzymatic activity (CoCl2 by 33%; MnCl2, 39%; BaCl2, 42%; NiCl2, 47%; MgCl2, 49%; CaCl2, 52%; CuCl2 and ZnSO4, both by 69%). 2.4. Reconstitution of BPO with vanadate ions A reconstitution process disclosed that the BPO of K. alvarezii is a vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase. The initial activity of the enzyme was calculated as 3.06 U/mg protein (100%). After 5 h incubation at pH 2.5 in the presence of Na-EDTA, total loss of enzymatic activity was observed (0%), and thus low pH was neces-sary to inactivate the enzyme. Overnight incubation with NaVO3 at neutral pH led to a reconstitution of the enzyme and recovery in activity to 1.29 U/mg (42%), while no activity was evident upon incubation in the absence of NaVO3. Moreover, it was observed that addition of 0.5 mM NaVO3 in the buffer solution effectively main-tained enzymatic activity. 2.5. Substrate specificity of BPO for organic compounds and stereoselectivity in bromination Substrate specificity and stereoselectivity are key issues in characterizing haloperoxidases, particularly with regard to its reaction mechanism. This is because the bromination of most organic compounds appear to nonenzymatically proceed with the electrophilic addition/substitution of molecular bromine (Br2) or hypobromous acid (BrOH), in spite of the fact that bromide ion is oxidized by a vana-dium-peroxo complex at the active sites of vanadium-dependent BPOs (Dau et al., 1999). According to the mech-anism, many organic compounds are brominated by this enzyme. Indeed, Itoh and colleagues demonstrated that despite evident substrate preference with BPO from C. pilu-lifera (marine red alga), several phenolic and heterocyclic compounds, alkenes, as well as keto acids were substrates of the enzyme (Itoh et al., 1987a, 1988). Butler reviewed an interesting phenomenon of vanadium-dependent A. nodosum and C. officinalis BPO/CPO, specifically, the active site bromination reaction when indole, but not cyto-sine, is used as a substrate (Butler, 1998). Accordingly, we examined a number of organic compounds for bromina-tion by BPO from K. alvarezii, and compared them with the previous data. Data presented in Fig. 4 reveals clear substrate specificity of the enzyme. Indene (2), styrene (3), 4-chlorostyrene (4), cinnamyl alcohol (5), and cyclo-hexene (6) were all brominated to the corresponding bro-mohydrin compounds by the enzyme, specifically, trans-2-bromo-1-indanol (7), 2-bromo-1-phenylethanol (8), 2-bromo-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-ethanol (9), 2-bromo-3-phe-nyl-1,3-propanediol (10), and 2-bromo-1-cyclohexanol (11). The above products corresponded to those in a previ-ously report, and were thus easily confirmed (Yamada et al., 1985a; Itoh et al., 1988). However, 2-bromo-1-pheny-lethanol (8) from styrene (3) and trans-2-bromo-1-indanol (7) from indene (2) were racemic mixtures on chiral HPLC analysis, and therefore no stereoselectivity in bromination was detected for K. alvarezii BPO. The enzyme additionally catalyzed the bromination of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol (12) to 2-bromo-3-metyl-1,3-dihydroxybutane (13), which dis-played comparable retention time and mass-spectra as the authentic compound. However, bromination of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol (12) analogues, including 3-methyl-3-butene-1-ol (14), 2-methyl-2-propene-1-ol (15), and 3-butene-1-ol (16), was not catalyzed by K. alvarezii BPO. All unreactive compounds contained an aliphatic isolated terminal double bond (Fig. 4). No brominated products were obtained with anisole (17), o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (18) and phenol red (19), implying that the enzyme catalyzes only specific reactions of addition, and not substitution of phenolic compounds. No brominated compounds (lipophilic, polar or volatile) were detected when phenylpyruvic acid (20) was used as a substrate. In addition, no activity was observed on pyruvic (21) and oxalacetic (22) acids, known precursors of volatile halomethanes for BPO in C. pilulifera leading to formation of CHBr3, CHClBr2 and CH2Br2 (Itoh and Shinya, 1994). Therefore, it was concluded that K. alvarezii enzyme does not utilize a-keto acids or phenolic compounds as a bromin-ation substrate. This is the first report on such clear sub-strate preference by BPO. Our data strongly suggest that the reaction of K. alvarezii BPO proceeds only at the active site, and does not depend on released active brominated species, such as Br+OHNone. This presumption contradicts the fact that there is no chiral induction of bromination for some substrates. We speculate that the enzyme contains no strict substrate binding site to control the stereoselectiv-ity in a similar manner as Corallina BPO. Our finding pro-vides new aspect of vanadium-BPO in marine algae, and possible application of the enzyme to substrate-specific bromination. 2.6. Determination of brominated compounds in K. alvarezii In view of the existence of BPO in K. alvarezii, the algae were analyzed for brominated compounds. K. alvar-ezii emitted an irritant compound, which caused itchiness on skin when disrupted. Consequently, volatile haloge-nated compounds were directly measured by heating the algae in a head-space bottle. No halogenated compounds, including CHBr3 or CH2Br2, were detected by GC\u2013MS. On the other hand, GC\u2013MS analysis of the EtOAc extract of K. alvarezii revealed the presence of dibromoacetalde-Fig. 4. Summary of substrate spectra of vanadium-dependent BPOs of different origins. Compounds brominated by BPO from K. alvarezii are displayed inside a solid circle, and those brominated by the enzyme from C. pilulifera inside a broken line. The compounds, that have not been tested by BPO of C. pilulifera, are presented with an asterisk. 1362 Z. Kamenarska et al. / Phytochemistry 68 (2007) 1358\u20131366 hyde (23) (C2H2OBr2) (tR 14.98 min); EI-MS m/z (isotope ratio, rel. int.): 200/202/204 [M]+ (1:2:1, 8), 172/174/176 (50), 120/122 (8), 93(100), which indicated a 97% identity with the authentic compound registered in NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) mass spectral library as shown in Fig. 5, and benzaldehyde (tR 18.78 min); EI-MS m/z: 106 [M] + (100), 105(80). We could not isolate the compounds because of their small amounts and easy vaporization. Dibromoacetaldehyde (23), which is toxic and irritant for many organisms, may participate in the defense mechanism of algae as allel-ochemical against invertebrates and microorganisms. BPO is possibly involved in the biosynthesis of dibromoacetal-dehyde (23), although the biosynthetic pathway is cur-rently unclear. In Hawaii islands, K. alvarezii is harmful to corals as a result of shadowing or smothering, and causes coral death, due to its high growth rate (Rodgers and Cox, 1999). Dib-romoacetaldehyde (23) identified in algae by our group may be involved in algal survival in the marine environ-ment by supporting the growth rate. From this view point, they should be more careful in aquaculturing a large amount of K. alvarezii in the sea. 3. Concluding remarks BPO was first identified in Kappaphycus alvarezi belong-ing to the Solieriaceae, which are important industrial sources of carrageenan. The enzyme was dependent on vanadium (V), and displayed a distinct substrate spectrum from that of previously reported BPOs from marine macro-algae. Dibromoacetaldehyde accumulated in K. alvarezi was additionally determined. 4. Experimental 4.1. Cultivation of algae Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty ex Silva (Soleriaceae, Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) from the Philippines was culti-vated in the subtropical waters during the summer in Kochi, Japan. The cultivation method employed thallus fragments fixed to floating ropes in the sea (Fig. 6). Voucher-specimen was deposited in the herbarium of Kochi University. Fresh algae cultured were frozen at None20 NoneC for experiments in the laboratory. Other algal sam-ples were cultured in Kochi. 4.2. Crude enzyme reparations form the algae Defrosted algae (1\u20132 g wet weight) were disrupted with sea sand (40\u201380 mesh) using a mortar and pestle at room temperature, and with the whole them extracted with 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulphonic acid\u2013NaOH (MES) buffer (pH 7.0, buffer A) at a ratio of 0.1 g algal sample/0.5 ml buffer at room temperature. Next, the crude extract was centrifuged at 4 NoneC for 30 min at 10,000g to obtain the supernatant. 4.3. Partial purification of the enzyme All manipulations were performed at room temperature using 10 mM MES buffer, pH 7.0 (buffer A), or 10 mM MES buffer, pH 7.0, plus 5 mM KBr and 0.5 mM NaVO3 (buffer B), unless stated otherwise. Each 30 g (total 120 g wet weight) of algae washed with distilled water were dis-rupted using a mortar and pestle, extracted with each Fig. 6. The photo of K. alvarezii cultivated in the sea. Fig. 5. GC\u2013MS analysis of brominated compound in K. alvarezii. Z. Kamenarska et al. / Phytochemistry 68 (2007) 1358\u20131366 1363 150 ml buffer B (total 600 ml), and centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min to obtain the supernatant as described above. Labiase (0.5 g: more than 5 U of N-acetylmuramoylhydro-lase), a lysis enzyme obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo), was added to the recovered supernatant (350 ml), and incubated at 37 NoneC for 48 h with gentle shak-ing to dissolve the polysaccharide and decrease the viscos-ity. After dialysis against buffer B, the enzyme solution was subjected to freeze-drying and dissolved in distilled H2O (140 ml). The solution was applied to a Octyl-Sepharose hydrophobic column chromatography (6 by 8 cm) previ-ously equilibrated with buffer B. Following application of the enzyme solution to the column, some non-adsorbed proteins and partially degraded polysaccharides were eluted with buffer B. The enzyme was eluted with a increase in concentrations of sodium cholate (0.2%, 0.5%, 1% and 1.5%) in buffer B (250 ml). Factions showing the activity (1% and 1.5% of sodium cholate) were combined and con-centrated to 140 ml with an ultrafiltration unit HHP-62K equiped with a Q0100 polysulfone membrane filter (Advan-tec Toyo, Tokyo, Japan). Following dialysis against buffer B, the enzyme solution was subjected to a QAE-Toyoperl-550 C column (6 cm by 6 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the enzyme eluted with a linear gradient of 0.005\u2013 1.5 M KBr. Enzyme fractions that displayed activity were combined, concentrated to 5 ml and subjected to dialysis, and used as purified enzyme. The protein concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm or by using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Smith et al., 1985), calibrated with bovine serum albumin as a standard (BCA Protein Assay Kit, Pierce/Thermo Scientific, USA). 4.4. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) Analytical PAGE was performed in 7% polyacrylamide gel with Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8.9) according to the method of Davis (1964). The gels were stained for protein with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, and staining of gels for enzyme activity was carried out by incubation in 10 mM MES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.5% pyrogallol, 10 mM H2O2 and 10 mM KBr in the dark at 4 NoneC. 4.5. Enzymatic activity Enzymatic activity was determined with the MCD test. Enzyme solution (0.01 ml) was assayed in the reaction mix-ture containing 10 mM MES buffer, pH 6.5, 60 lM MCD, 20 mM KBr and 10 mM H2O2 in a total volume of 1 ml at 25 NoneC. Enzymatic activity (U/ml) was spectrophotometri-cally measured by the decrease in absorbance of MCD at 290 nm (e = 19,900 cmNone1 MNone1), according to the bromina-tion of MCD. Catalase activity was assayed by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm (e = 43.6 MNone1 cmNone1) of H2O2 in a total volume of 1.0 ml (Itoh et al., 2001). One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzed the formation of bro-minated MCD or decomposition of H2O2 in 1 min. 4.6. Halide ion specificity Halide ion specificity of BPO was determined for FNone, ClNone, BrNone and INone. The general MCD test was performed by replacing KBr with KF and KCl for FNone and ClNone. For iodide, the oxidation rate was directly measured. The reac-tion mixture consisted of 100 mM MES buffer, pH 6.5, 5 mM KI and 2 mM H2O2, and 0.005 ml of enzyme solu-tion in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction rate was 1364 Z. Kamenarska et al. / Phytochemistry 68 (2007) 1358\u20131366 calculated from the increase in absorbance at 350 nm due to triiodide complex (INone3 ) formation, according to the method of Hosoya (1963). A control containing no enzyme was included in the experiments, and the difference between the two rates was used to determine the rate of enzyme-cat-alyzed triiodide complex formation. One unit of the enzyme activity was determined as the amount producing 1 lmol of \u00f0\u00bdI2None \u00fe \u00bdINone3 None\u00de per one min from INone. The equation is expressed as follows: U/ml enzyme solution = (DA350with enzyme/min None DA350without enzyme/ min)/26 \u00b7 (1.3 \u00b7 10None3/[INone]initial + 1) \u00b7 (volume of reaction mixture/volume of enzyme solution). 4.7. Km values for H2O2 and KBr The general MCD test was performed by successively altering concentrations of each compound, KBr (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 mM final concentration) and H2O2 (0.1, 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 mM final concentration) in the assay mixture. Km values were calculated from a Lineweaver\u2013 Burk plot. 4.8. Inhibitors and activators of the enzymatic activity Enzymatic reactions were performed in the presence of 1 mM CuCl2, ZnSO4, NiCl2, BaCl2, CoCl2, CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, AgNO3, Na2MoO4, VOSO4, NaVO3, p-chloromer-curibenzoic acid (p-CMB), iodoacetic acid and EDTA, respectively, using the crude enzyme preparation, which was extracted with buffer A without KBr and NaVO3. To establish the effects of specific compounds on the sta-bility and activity of BPO, the crude enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mM MES buffer A, in the presence of 5 mM each of the above mentioned compounds, 1 and 5 mM of NaCl, 5 mM of KCl, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 mM KBr for 12 h, and the activity changes were measured. 4.9. Reconstitution of the enzyme with vanadate ion To remove the prosthetic metal ions from BPO, the pH of the enzyme solution was decreased to 2.5 using 1 M HCl, and 1 mM EDTA/Na (final concentration) was added to the solution. After 5 h incubation (complete loss of enzy-matic activity), pH was increased from 2.5 to 6.85. The test solution was divided into two fractions. NaVO3 (5 mM final concentration) was added to reconstitute the enzyme in the second fraction. The two test solutions were dialyzed against 10 mM MES buffer, pH 7.0, plus 1 mM EDTA/Na (final concentration) to remove excess NaVO3 for 24 h. The enzymatic activity of reconstituted enzyme was measured and the degree of reconstitution evaluated. 4.10. Brominating activity and product analysis To determine the substrates of K. alvarezii BPO, 0.05 ml of enzyme solution (total 0.03 U) was added to the reaction mixture consisting of 100 mM MES buffer, pH 6.5, 2 mM H2O2 and 2 mM KBr in a total volume of 0.5 ml. As potential substrates, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol (12), 3-methyl-3-butene-1-ol (14), 2-methyl-2-propene-1-ol (15), 3-butene-1-ol (16), indene (2), styrene (3), 4-chlorostyrene (4), trans-cinnamyl alcohol (5), cyclohexene (6), anisole (17), o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (18), phenol red (19), phenylpyru-vate (20) (Itoh et al., 1988, 2001),were used at a final con-centration of 10 mM. Blank tests without H2O2 and KBr were additionally included. After 24 h reaction in a Bio-shaker (1250 rpm, Taiteck, Tokyo) at 25 NoneC, the reaction mixture was subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000g. The supernatant was transferred and extracted with EtOAc (0.5 ml). The EtOAc extract was dried with anhyd. Na2SO4 and analyzed by GC\u2013MS. Polar products from phenylpyruvate were also analyzed by GC\u2013MS after conversion to methyl esters using trimethylsilyldiazome-thane. The reagent was added drop-wise into the dried and evaporated product mixture until the emission of bub-bles stopped. A QP-2010 GC\u2013MS (Shimadzu) equipped with a DB-VRX (J&W Scientific, 60 m \u00b7 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 lm film thickness) was employed for GC\u2013MS analysis. The column pressure was 130 kPa, and the linear velocity of He gas was 27 cm/s. Samples were injected in a split mode of 1:40 at 180 NoneC with the following temperature program: 60 NoneC for 5 min, increased by 10 NoneC/min to 250 NoneC and a 10 min hold at 250 NoneC. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV with an electron-impact ion source (EI, 200 NoneC). trans-2-Bromo-1-indanol (7); retention time (tR) 28.74 min in GC\u2013MS, EI-MS m/z (isotope ratio, rel. int.): 212/214 [M]+ (1:1, 4.2), 133 (87), 115 (100), 103/ 105 (70). 2-Bromo-1-phenylethanol (8); tR 26.14, EI-MS m/z: 200/202 [M]+ (1:1, 1), 107 (100), 103/105 (6.4). 2-Bromo-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-ethanol (9); tR 30.44, EI-MS m/z: 234/236/238 [M]+ (3:4:1, 4.3), 154 (4), 141/143 (100), 125 (25), 113/115 (80), 103 (32). 2-Bromo-3-phenyl-1,3-propanediol (10); tR 32.19, EI-MS m/z: 230/232 [M]+ (1:1, 1), 150 (1) 133 (13), 107 (100). 2-Bromo-1-cyclohexanol (11); tR 22.15, EI-MS m/z: 178/180 [M]+ (10.6), 158/160 (2.1), 132/134 (42), 122/ 124 (28), 108 (28), 99 (100). 4.11. Halomethane analysis The method of Itoh and Shinya (1994) was applied for determining the volatile halomethanes from fresh algae. Four samples of K. alvarezii (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 g wet weight), washed with cool autoclaved seawater and dried with a paper towel for 2 min, were individually transferred into 20 ml vials, and sealed with silicon rubber septa and aluminum caps. Each vial was maintained at 60 NoneC for 15 min to ensure transfer of volatile halomethanes into the gas phase. The gas (0.1 ml) was withdrawn and ana-Z. Kamenarska et al. / Phytochemistry 68 (2007) 1358\u20131366 1365 lyzed by GC\u2013MS. The above GC\u2013MS apparatus was employed for analysis at a column pressure of 130 kPa. Samples were injected in a splitless mode at a temperature program of 40 NoneC for 5 min, increased by 10 NoneC/min to 200 NoneC and a 5 min hold at 200 NoneC. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV with an electron-impact ion source (EI, 200 NoneC). In vitro formation of halomethanes by BPO from spe-cific keto acids was measured in a 10.0 ml reaction mixture comprising 50 mM MES buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mM KBr, 10 mM H2O2, 2.0 ml of enzyme extract (total 1.2 U), 5 mM pyruvic, phenylpyruvic or oxalacetic acid, respec-tively, in a total volume of 20 ml within each vial as described above. Reactions were performed for 24 h at 25 NoneC, followed by 60 NoneC for 15 min. A control run was performed without the enzyme, KBr or H2O2. 4.12. Analysis of the stereoselectivities of bromination To determine the absolute configuration of the bro-mohydrine products, analytical HPLC using a Shimadzu LC-10AT system equipped with a Chiracel OB-H (4.6 \u00b7 250 mm, Daicel Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was performed for trans-2-bromo-1-indanol (7) and (R,S)-2-bromo-1-phenylethanol (8). The mobile phase con-tained n-hexane/2-propanol (9:1 w/w) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The product was spectrophotometrically detected at 220 nm. Retention times of racemic trans-2-bromo-1-indanol (7) were 12.3 and 16.8 min, while those of (R,S)-2-bromo-1-phenylethanol (8) were 16.6 and 20.5 min, respectively (Kawanami et al., 2002). 4.13. Analysis of brominated compounds in K. alvarezii Samples of K. alvarezii (about 5 g) were extracted with EtOAc, MeOH and CHCl3 (15 ml each), respectively, at 37 NoneC with stirring at 115 rpm for 48 h. Each extract was evaporated to a small amount, and a portion was subjected to GC\u2013MS analysis (see Section 4.10 for details). Acids isolated with MeOH and CHCl3 were analyzed after con-version to their methyl esters using trimethylsilyldiazome-thane, as described above. Similar GC\u2013MS conditions were applied for analysis. 4.14. Chemicals 2-Bromo-3-metyl-1,3-dihydroxybutane (13) was synthe-sized from 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol (12) by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (Hanzlik, 1988). 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-ol (12) (430 mg, 5 mmol), water (225 mg, 12.5 mmol) and N-bromosuccinimide (1.78 g, 10 mmol) were dissolved in 10 ml of DMSO, and maintained at room temperature for 20 min. To terminate the reaction, excess water was added to the mixture. The product was extracted with CH2Cl2, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and purified by sil-ica gel chromatography using n-hexane and EtOAc (4:1). 2-Bromo-3-metyl-1,3-dihydroxybutane (13) was obtained with a yield of 78% (714 mg); 1H NMR (CD2Cl2) d (ppm) 1.4 (s, 3H), 1.4 (s, 3H), 4.13 (t, 1H), 4.01 (d, 2H). Octyl-Sepharose was prepared as follows: Sepharose CL-4B (200 ml) was washed with distilled H2O, and sus-pended in 0.6 M NaOH (260 ml). Epichlorohydrin (20 ml) was added to the solution, and stirred for 2 h in a water bath at 40 NoneC. The mixture was filtered, and the epoxy-activated Sepharose CL-4B was extensively washed with distilled H2O. Activated Sepharose was resuspended in 0.1 M NaOH (260 ml) containing 20% dioxane (v/v) and 3.4 g of octylamine, and stirred for 20 h in a water bath at 30 NoneC. Next, octyl-Sepharose was filtered, and com-pletely washed with 0.1 M NaCl containing 35% 1-PrOH (v/v), followed by distilled H2O. All other chemicals were of analytical grade, and available commercially.

        "Bromoperoxidase activity was initially detected in marine macroalgae belonging to the Solieriaceae family (Gigartinales, Rhodo-phyta), including Solieria robusta (Greville) Kylin, Eucheuma serra J. Agardh and Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty, which are impor-tant industrial sources of the polysaccharide carrageenan. Notably, the purification of bromoperoxidase was difficult because due to the coexistence of viscoid polysaccharides. The activity of the partially purified enzyme was dependent on the vanadate ion, and displayed a distinct substrate spectrum from that of previously reported vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases of marine macroalgae. The enzyme was specific for BrNone and INone ions and inactive toward FNone and ClNone. The Km values for Br None and H2O2 were 2.5 \u00b7 10None3 M and 8.5 \u00b7 10None5 M, respectively. The halogenated product, dibromoacetaldehyde, that accumulated in K. alvarezii was additionally determined. None 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "1. Introduction",
        "Halogenated compounds are synthesized by several marine algae with the aid of haloperoxidases. These com-pounds are classified into indoles, terpenes, acetogenins, phenols, and volatile halogenated hydrocarbons (Faulkner, 2000, 2001, 2002). Halogenated marine metabolites gener-ally possess biological antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities (Cowan, 1999). Some additionally function as allelochemicals in the marine envi-ronment (Sakata et al., 1991; Denboh et al., 1997; Ohsawa et al., 2001).",

While the biosynthesis of halogenated marine natural products has intrigued scientists for decades, the mecha-nism has remained unclear to date (Littlechild et al., 2002). Haloperoxidases generally oxidize a halide anion (XNone) into a halonium cation (X+) with H2O2, and the X + and its related species (XOH, X2, X None",

        "many organic substrates as an electrophile (Yamada et al., 1985a; Itoh et al., 1988). The enzymes are divided into three groups, specifically, heme types (eukaryotic heme types and bacterial types containing protoporphylin IX as a prosthetic group) (Morris and Hager, 1966; Manthey and Hager, 1981), bacterial non-metal enzymes (perhydrolase) (van Pee et al., 1997; Kawanami et al., 2002) and eukary-otic vanadium-containing enzymes (Itoh et al., 1986; Ohs-awa et al., 2001; Krenn et al., 1989). Bacterial non-metal enzymes are related to the esterases and lipases because they contain the representative catalytic triad (Itoh et al., 2001).",

        "Vanadium-containing bromoperoxidases (BPOs) spe-cific for BrNone and INone are widespread in marine macroalgae such as Corallina (Itoh et al., 1987a; Sheffield et al., 1993) and Ascophyllum (Vilter, 1984; Krenn et al., 1989; Butler, 1998). Some of these enzymes display low activity towards ClNone (Soedjak and Butler, 1990), and modification of enzyme can change the halide ion speci-ficity (Ohshiro et al., 2004). Although oxidation of bro-mide ion occurs at the active site in the case of vanadium-containing enzymes (Dau et al., 1999; Little-child et al., 2002), BPOs including Corallina generally do not display distinct substrate specificity or stereoselec-tivity (Itoh et al., 1987b, 1988; Soedjak and Butler, 1990). Recent studies show that flavin-dependent halogenases involved in chlorination of secondary metabolites in bac-teria catalyze the regioselective chlorination of trypto-phan or pyrrole derivatives (Dong et al., 2005; van Pee and Patallo, 2006).",
        "During screening, it was initially observed that specific samples of marine macroalgae belonging to the Solieria-ceae family, including Kappaphycus alvarezi (Doty) Doty, exhibited significant bromoperoxidase activity (Kam-enarska et al., 2006). K. alvarezii and its related algae are the basic source of carrageenan (a polysaccharide), which is commonly applied in the food industry and medicine. Owing to high commercial interest, K. alvarezii is widely cultivated in the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Tan-zania. Recently, tentative cultivation during the summer season was introduced in Shikoku Island, Southern Japan (Ohno et al., 1994). To date, most investigations on this alga focus on polysaccharide content and its properties (Ohno et al., 1996). Here, we report the properties of this novel BPO displaying distinct substrate specificity and its natural brominated compound was identified in K. alvarezii.",

        "To our knowledge, this is the first report on BPO activ-ity in these red algae, except for the previously documented Eucheuma denticulatum (Mtolera et al., 1996) and Meristi-ella gelidium (Collen et al., 1994) in the Solieriaceae. These produce volatile halogenated compounds when exposed to stress conditions, such as at an elevated pH and at high light intensities.",
        "The addition of KBr to the crude extracts of K. alvar-ezii during overnight dialysis led to improved stability. Moreover, enhanced stability and elevated activity was observed with increasing concentrations of KBr during dialysis (initial activity, 0.007 U/ml (100%), 0.1 mM KBr, 0.18 U/mg protein (129%); 0.5 mM KBr, 0.037 U/ml (529%); 1 mM KBr, 0.08 U/ml (1142%); and 5 mM KBr, 0.17 U/ml (2428%)), respectively. While the mecha-nism of activation by KBr is currently unclear, it is spec-ulated that the masked BPO activity is stimulated upon incubation with BrNone ions. KCl did not activate the enzyme. K. alvarezii was selected as the BPO source for further experiments, since its specific activity was high and biomass was available by aquaculture. The buffer was supplemented with 5 mM KBr and 0.5 mM NaVO3 throughout the isolation and purification of BPO, unless otherwise specified.",
        "2.2. Enzyme purification",
        "Since BPO of K. alvarezii was stable in the presence of BrNone and vanadate ions, all purification procedures were performed at room temperature. BPO was extracted from the alga and partially purified using the procedures described in Section 4. The elimination of polysaccharide from crude enzyme by adding gel-forming agents to the enzyme solution, such as CaCl2 or KCl, led to a drastic loss in enzymatic activity, indicating that BPO was probably bound to polysaccharides. The activities of a number of enzymes were next examined that hydrolyze polysaccha-rides: LabiaseNone from Streptomyces fulvissimus, mainly con-taining N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase (Ohbuchi et al., 2001), was effective in decreasing the viscosity of crude extracts of K. alvarezii, but relatively ineffective in completely remov-ing polysaccharides from the enzyme solution. Thus, only partial purification of the enzyme was achieved. To purify the enzyme to homogeneity, further steps to completely hydrolyze the contaminating polysaccarides are essential, but this may lead to loss of enzyme activity. For this rea-son, complete purification of the enzyme was not attempted, and most experiments were performed with par-tially purified enzyme. The results of the purification are summarized in Table 2.",

        "2.3. Enzyme properties",
        "BPO of K. alvarezii catalyzed the bromination of mono-chlorodimedone (MCD) 1 in the presence of bromide ion (3.05 U/mg protein, 100%), i.e. the oxidation of BrNone to Br+ and its related species, but not chlorination or fluorina-tion. The enzyme also displayed strong oxidation activity towards INone to produce I2 (2.08 U/mg protein, 68%). Despite variable assay methods and activities, BPO activity for INone appeared to be comparable with that for BrNone. The influence of the KBr concentration on BPO activity was determined. A rise in enzymatic activity was observed with increasing KBr concentrations (from 0.5 to 20 mM). However, a decrease in activity (85% at 40 mM) was evi-dent at higher levels of KBr. Using the linear portion of the saturation curve, the Km value for Br None was calculated from Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot as 2.5 mM (Fig. 2a). The influence of the H2O2 concentrations was also deter-mined. The Km value was calculated as 8.5 \u00b7 10None5 M (Fig. 2b). Inhibition by H2O2 was detected at concentra-tions higher than 10 mM. The Km value for Br None was rather low, compared to that of previously studied BPOs, while that for H2O2 was comparable (1.1 \u00b7 10None2 M for BrNone, 9.2 \u00b7 10None5 M for H2O2 reported for C. pililifera BPO (pH 6.0) (Itoh et al., 1986), and 9.4 \u00b7 10None3 M for BrNone, 1.04 \u00b7 10None4 M for H2O2 by Ascophyllum nodosum BPO",

        "The effects of a range of compounds for crude enzyme, described in Section 4, were also determined. AgNO3, p-CMB, iodoacetic acid (sulfuhydryl reagents), and Na2MoO4, VOSO4, NaVO3, NaCl and EDTA did not affect the enzymatic activity. On the other hand, a number of divalent metal ions increased enzymatic activity (CoCl2 by 33%; MnCl2, 39%; BaCl2, 42%; NiCl2, 47%; MgCl2, 49%; CaCl2, 52%; CuCl2 and ZnSO4, both by 69%).",

After 5 h incubation at pH 2.5 in the presence of Na-EDTA, total loss of enzymatic activity was observed (0%), and thus low pH was neces-sary to inactivate the enzyme. Overnight incubation with NaVO3 at neutral pH led to a reconstitution of the enzyme and recovery in activity to 1.29 U/mg (42%), while no activity was evident upon incubation in the absence of NaVO3. Moreover, it was observed that addition of 0.5 mM NaVO3 in the buffer solution effectively main-tained enzymatic activity.",
        "2.5. Substrate specificity of BPO for organic compounds and stereoselectivity in bromination",
        "Substrate specificity and stereoselectivity are key issues in characterizing haloperoxidases, particularly with regard to its reaction mechanism. This is because the bromination of most organic compounds appear to nonenzymatically proceed with the electrophilic addition/substitution of molecular bromine (Br2) or hypobromous acid (BrOH), in spite of the fact that bromide ion is oxidized by a vana-dium-peroxo complex at the active sites of vanadium-dependent BPOs (Dau et al., 1999). According to the mech-anism, many organic compounds are brominated by this enzyme. Indeed, Itoh and colleagues demonstrated that despite evident substrate preference with BPO from C. pilu-lifera (marine red alga), several phenolic and heterocyclic compounds, alkenes, as well as keto acids were substrates of the enzyme (Itoh et al., 1987a, 1988). Butler reviewed an interesting phenomenon of vanadium-dependent A. nodosum and C. officinalis BPO/CPO, specifically, the active site bromination reaction when indole, but not cyto-sine, is used as a substrate (Butler, 1998). Accordingly, we examined a number of organic compounds for bromina-tion by BPO from K. alvarezii, and compared them with the previous data. Data presented in Fig. 4 reveals clear substrate specificity of the enzyme. Indene (2), styrene (3), 4-chlorostyrene (4), cinnamyl alcohol (5), and cyclo-hexene (6) were all brominated to the corresponding bro-mohydrin compounds by the enzyme, specifically, trans-2-bromo-1-indanol (7), 2-bromo-1-phenylethanol (8), 2-bromo-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-ethanol (9), 2-bromo-3-phe-nyl-1,3-propanediol (10), and 2-bromo-1-cyclohexanol (11). The above products corresponded to those in a previ-ously report, and were thus easily confirmed (Yamada et al., 1985a; Itoh et al., 1988). However, 2-bromo-1-pheny-lethanol (8) from styrene (3) and trans-2-bromo-1-indanol (7) from indene (2) were racemic mixtures on chiral HPLC analysis, and therefore no stereoselectivity in bromination was detected for K. alvarezii BPO. The enzyme additionally catalyzed the bromination of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol (12) to 2-bromo-3-metyl-1,3-dihydroxybutane (13), which dis-played comparable retention time and mass-spectra as the authentic compound. However, bromination of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol (12) analogues, including 3-methyl-3-butene-1-ol (14), 2-methyl-2-propene-1-ol (15), and 3-butene-1-ol (16), was not catalyzed by K. alvarezii BPO. All unreactive compounds contained an aliphatic isolated terminal double bond (Fig. 4).",
        "No brominated products were obtained with anisole (17), o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (18) and phenol red (19), implying that the enzyme catalyzes only specific reactions of addition, and not substitution of phenolic compounds. No brominated compounds (lipophilic, polar or volatile) were detected when phenylpyruvic acid (20) was used as a substrate. In addition, no activity was observed on pyruvic (21) and oxalacetic (22) acids, known precursors of volatile halomethanes for BPO in C. pilulifera leading to formation of CHBr3, CHClBr2 and CH2Br2 (Itoh and Shinya, 1994). Therefore, it was concluded that K. alvarezii enzyme does not utilize a-keto acids or phenolic compounds as a bromin-ation substrate. This is the first report on such clear sub-strate preference by BPO. Our data strongly suggest that the reaction of K. alvarezii BPO proceeds only at the active site, and does not depend on released active brominated species, such as Br+OHNone. This presumption contradicts the fact that there is no chiral induction of bromination for some substrates. We speculate that the enzyme contains no strict substrate binding site to control the stereoselectiv-ity in a similar manner as Corallina BPO. Our finding pro-vides new aspect of vanadium-BPO in marine algae, and possible application of the enzyme to substrate-specific bromination.",

        "In view of the existence of BPO in K. alvarezii, the algae were analyzed for brominated compounds. K. alvar-ezii emitted an irritant compound, which caused itchiness on skin when disrupted. Consequently, volatile haloge-nated compounds were directly measured by heating the algae in a head-space bottle. No halogenated compounds, including CHBr3 or CH2Br2, were detected by GC\u2013MS. On the other hand, GC\u2013MS analysis of the EtOAc extract of K. alvarezii revealed the presence of dibromoacetalde-",

We could not isolate the compounds because of their small amounts and easy vaporization. Dibromoacetaldehyde (23), which is toxic and irritant for many organisms, may participate in the defense mechanism of algae as allel-ochemical against invertebrates and microorganisms. BPO is possibly involved in the biosynthesis of dibromoacetal-dehyde (23), although the biosynthetic pathway is cur-rently unclear. In Hawaii islands, K. alvarezii is harmful to corals as a result of shadowing or smothering, and causes coral death, due to its high growth rate (Rodgers and Cox, 1999). Dib-romoacetaldehyde (23) identified in algae by our group may be involved in algal survival in the marine environ-ment by supporting the growth rate. From this view point, they should be more careful in aquaculturing a large amount of K. alvarezii in the sea.",
