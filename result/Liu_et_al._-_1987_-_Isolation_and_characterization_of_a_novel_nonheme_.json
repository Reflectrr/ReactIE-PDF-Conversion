The heme prosthetic group plays an important function in the catalytic activity, with both the iron and the porphyrin being involved in the storing of oxidizing equivalents and the regulating of oxidation-reduction potential (2). However, among the bromoperoxidases, several nonheme enzymes have now been reported: a nonheme lactoperoxidase from bovine milk (3), a nonheme vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase from the marine alga Ascophyllum nodosum (4) and a nonheme iron-containing bromoperoxidase from the seaweed Corallina pilulifera (5). During the course of our screening for novel enzymes, a haloperoxidase was discovered in a dematiaceous hyphomycete, Curvularia inaequalis. We undertook the isolation and characterization of this enzyme, and found it to be a nonheme, zinc-containing chloroperoxidase showing high stability under oxidative conditions. MATERIALS AND METHOnS Fungal Organism and Culture Conditions -Curvularia inaequalis CMCC 755 was grown on agar seed plates at 25OC for 7 days. The spore mass was used to inoculate sterile FA-1 germination media in flasks that were then incubated a% 25\u00b0C with agitation for 3 days. The growth material was used to inoculate sterile FP fermentation media in flasks that were then incubated at 25'C with ayitation for 12 days, as previously described (6). Isolation and Purification -The fungal growth material was disrupted by sonication and then filtered. (NH4) SO4 was added to the filtrate, under stirring, to 40% of saturation. After 1 hr, the precipitate was collected and discarded. (NH ) SO was then added to 55% of saturation. After 1 hr, the precipitate was c llected by centrifugation and dissolved in a minimal volume 48 4 of C).lM phosphate buffer pH 6.0. The solution was applied to a DEAF-Sepharose CL-6R column. Protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 50 mM to 500 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0. The haloperoxidase eluted at about 4011 mM. Activity Assays -The chlorinating activity of the purified enzyme was determined by monitoring the decrease in A2g2nm due to the chlorination of monochlorodimedone (MCD) at 25'C. The reaction mixture consisted of 2 ml of potassium phosphate huffer (100 mM, pH 5.0) KC1 (1 nM), MCn (0.005 mu) and H202 (0.1 mM). To initiate the reaction, 0.01 ml of sample was added. Substrate Reactivity -In addition to the chlorination of the B-diketone monochlorodimedone (MCO), the chloroperoxidase from C. _ ;;i;quaIl,)is ails: catalyzed the chlorination of the alkene ally1 chloride reaction protocol previously described for the chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago was used (l), but the reaction pH was 6.0 rather than 3.0. Unlike the chloroperoxidase from C. fumago, the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis did not catalyze the peroxidation of primary alcohols to zdehydes nor the epoxidation of alkenes. The reaction protocols previously described for ally1 alcohol and styrene were used (7,g). Kinetic Properties -Using as a spectrophotometric assay the chlorination of monochlorodimedone (MCD), we examined the activity of the chloroperoxidase in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at 25\u00b0C as a function of H202 330 Vol. 142, No. 2, 1987 BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS a b C L-1 2 I I I I I I I I I 5 10 15 20 0 5 10 15 20 1 L I I I 1 5 10 15 20 MMJTES AFTER INJECTION INTO GC %%%&on .of ally1 chloride.

As has been shown for the other haloperoxidases (9), there is an interrelationship between the H2n2 and Cl-concentrations that affects the optimum pU and K values. At the concentrations normally run in the MIXI assay (0.1 mM HP& and 1 mM Cl-), the chloroperoxidase had a pY optimum of 5.0 and a tlurnover number of 240 mol of MCI) per mol of enzyme per s. For comparison, the chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) had a pH optimum of 3.0 and a turnover numher of 1500 mol of MCD per mol of enzyme per s. Protein Measurement -Protein concentrations were determined hy use of the Bin-Rad protein reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard. Molecular Weight and Subunit Compositi,on -The molecular weight of the purified chloroperoxidase was determined by gel filtration chromatography with a Sephacryl S-300 column. The column was calibrated with a gel filtration standard containing (molecular weight) catalase (732,00@), aldolase (158,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000) and ovalbumin (44,000). The apparent molecular weight of the chloroperoxidase was estimated to be 24(3,000. The chloroperoxidase was dissociated into component subunits and their molecular weights were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A protein band of molecular weight 66,OnO was observed whether or not P-mercaptoethanol was present. The chloroperoxidase appears to be composed of four suhunits of equal size and these are associated entirely by noncovalent forces. Optical Spectra -The chloroperoxidase exhibits a single absorption band in the ultraviolet range, centered at 280 nm.

Since the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis lacks heme, it should -he more stable in the presence of HOCl. It should also he more stable to the oxidative reagent, H202, which is utilized in the haloperoxidase reaction. This was demonstrated by incllbating at room temperature both the heme-containing chloroperoxidase from C. fumago and the heme-minus chloroperoxidase -from C. inaequalis in the presence of added HOCl. At a HOC1 concentration of -0.5 mM, the heme-containing chloroperoxidase was completely inactivated within 2 minutes, while the heme-minus chloroperoxidase still retained 90% of its initial activity (Fig. 3). In addition, when the chloroperoxidases were incubated at a constant H202 concentration (200 mbl), the heme-containing chloroperoxidase was again completely inactivated within 2 minutes, while the heme-minus chloroperoxidase showed no significant inactivation even after 25 hours of incubation. It has not heen reported if the heme-minus hromo-peroxidases demonstrate this stability. RFFERENCES 1. Neidleman, S. L., and Geigert, J.
