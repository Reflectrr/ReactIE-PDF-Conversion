In vitro reaction of Rdc2 and a flavin reductase (Fre) with seven different hydroxyquinolines revealed that 3-hydroxyquinoline (3), 5-hydroxyquinoline (5), 6-hydroxyquinoline (6), and 7-hydroxyquinoline (7) can be specifically halogenated. These products were prepared by incubating the corresponding substrates with IPTG-induced E. coli BL21(DE3)/Rdc2.

Introduction Quinolines are common building blocks of numerous bioactive molecules, such as camptothecin (anticancer),1 chloroquine (anti-malarial),2 quinine (antimalarial),3 quinidine (antiarrhythmic),4 and montelukast (anti-asthma) shown in Figure 1.5 Hydroxyquino-lines are used as versatile chelating agents and precursors to many pharmaceuticals and pesticides.6 For example, the derivatives of 8-hydroxyquinoline can be used as multi-target compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.7 Hydroxyquinolines can be chemically synthesized from quinoline (1, Fig. 2). Halogenated compounds represent about 20% of pharmaceuti-cals on the market and a quarter of those in the development pipe-line. Chlorohydroxyquinolines are known to possess important medicinal properties.8 For example, it has been reported that 5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline has significant antimycoplasma activ-ity.9 However, preparation of halogenated molecules relies on chemical methods. Chemical halogenation typically requires harsh reaction conditions including high temperatures and toxic reagents (such as chlorine gas, hydrochloric acid, and hydrogen peroxide). This is often accompanied by poor selectivity, which results in unspecific halogenation and undesired byproducts, creating diffi-culties in the purification process.10 For example, a previous research showed that chlorination of quinoline at 160\u2013190 NoneC yielded a mixture of five chlorinated products, including 3,4-dichloroquinoline, 3,4,6-trichloroquinoline, 3,4,8-trichloroquinoline, 3,4,6,8-tetrachloroquinoline, and 3,4,6,7,8-pentachloroquinoline.11 Biological halogenation is considered as a better approach for its high selectivity. Flavin-dependent halogenases are major players in the introduction of halogen in the biosynthesis of halo-genated natural products such as radicicol.12 Most reported flavin-dependent halogenases are prokaryotic tryptophan halogenases. The use of these enzymes in the preparation of halogenated mole-cules was limited due to their strict substrate specificity. A recent work reported that a tryptophan 6-halogenase (Th-Fal) from a thermophilic halotolerant Streptomyces violaceusniger can halo-genate several tryptophan derivatives and aromatic substrates, including methyltryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, kynurenine, anthranilic acid, and anthranilamide.13 However, there is still a lack of a highly flexible halogenase that can be used for a broad range of substrates. Rdc2 is the first flavin-dependent halogenase identified from fungi. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of radicicol, specifically chlorinating monocillins (a group of resor-cylic acids) at C-6. Rdc2 was found to have flexible substrate speci-ficity and can work on similar macrolactones and other structurally different compounds such as oxytetracycline and curcumin.14 A homology model of Rdc2 was built, which indicates that the space at the active site of this enzyme is large enough to accommodate different substrates. Two hydroxyisoquinolines were converted by Rdc2 to two new halogenated derivatives.15 However, specific enzymatic preparation of chlorohydroxyquinolines has not been N H3CO HO N H H Quinine N H3CO HO N H H Quinidine N N O O O HO Camptothecin NCl HN N Chloroquine NCl S O OH H HO Montelukast Figure 1.

Selected 1H\u20131H COSY and HMBC correlations of 3a, 5a, 6a and 7a. 5264 F. Xu et al. / Tetrahedron Letters 57 (2016) 5262\u20135265 each product, 1H (Figs. S3\u2013S6), DEPTQ-135 (Figs. S7\u2013S10), HSQC, HMBC, and 1H\u20131H COSY spectra were recorded. The proton and carbon signals were assigned and are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The 1H NMR spectrum of 3a showed five proton signals, includ-ing two doublet proton signals (d 7.99 and 8.17), an overlapped sig-nal (2H, d 7.63\u20137.70), and a singlet (d 8.62). This is one proton less than the substrate, indicating that one of the CH of 3-hydrox-yquinoline was chlorinated. The 1H\u20131H COSY spectra showed a spin system that consists of the two doublet signals and two over-lapped proton signals, which suggested that the halogenation did not occur on the benzene ring and thus one of the protons on the pyridine ring was substituted by a chlorine atom. This was sup-ported by the presence of the singlet signal, which was assigned to H-2 according to the HMBC correlations (Fig. 4) of this proton to C-4 (d 102.9) and C-8a (d 102.2). Thus, it can be deduced that the halogenation occurred at C-4 position, which is ortho to the hydroxyl group (Fig. 4). This was further supported by the HMBC correlations of H-5 (d 8.17) to C-4. Thus, 3a was identified as 3-hydroxy-4-chloroquinoline. The 1H and DEPTQ-135 NMR of 5a also showed five CH signals, confirming that one proton of the substrate 5 was chlorinated. The signal of H-2 can be easily located in the low field at d 8.83. Two spin systems were observed in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Fig. 4). The CH\u2013CH\u2013CH system belongs to the pyridine ring, which includes H-2 (d 8.83, d), H-3 (d 7.56, dd), and H-4 (d 8.72, d). The CH-CH system consists of two protons from the benzene ring, including the proton signals at d 7.55 (d) and d 7.68 (d). Thus, we concluded that that one of the protons of the benzene ring was substituted by a chlorine atom. The large coupling constant of 9.0 Hz indicated that the two CH groups are ortho to each other. Accordingly, the possibility of C-7 halogenation can be ruled out. Based on the HMBC correlations of both proton signals at d 7.55 and 7.68 to C-8a at d 143.8 (Fig. 4), the chlorination site was deter-mined to be at C-6. Thus, this product was identified as 5-hydroxy-6-chloroquinoline. The 1H and DEPTQ-135 NMR spectra of 6a are similar to those of 5a. The signal of H-2 was located in the low field at d 8.80. With this signal, the spin system of H-2/H-3/H-4 was identified by the 1H\u20131H COSY correlations (Fig. 4). The other spin system consists of two doublet signals from the benzene ring that belongs to H-7 and H-8, as suggested by the large coupling constant of 9.0 Hz. Accordingly, it can be deduced that C-5 of 6 was chlorinated. This was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H-4 (d 8.49, d) and H-7 (d 7.58, d) to C-5 at d 112.0. Therefore, 6a was characterized as 5-chloro-6-hydroxyquinoline. The 1H NMR spectrum of 7a showed five proton signals. The presence of a CH\u2013CH\u2013CH spin system in the 1H\u20131H COSY spectrum (Fig. 4) indicated that none of the protons on the pyridine ring was chlorinated. The 1H\u20131H COSY correlations of H-5 to H-6, which are doublet signals at d 7.79 and 7.34 with a coupling constant of 8.9 Hz, respectively, indicated that Rdc2 introduced a chlorine atom to C-8. The structure was thus characterized as 7-hydroxy-8-chloroquinoline, which was supported by the HMBC correlations shown in Figure 4. 7a is a new compound. Structural identification of the products 3a, 5a, 6a, and 7a sug-gested that among the seven tested hydroxyquinolines, four were taken by Rdc2 as substrates to form the corresponding monochlo-rinated products. The chlorination reaction is highly specific as the position where the chlorine atom was introduced is ortho to the hydroxyl group of the four substrates. This is consistent with the results for isoquinolines in our previous studies. A number of pharmaceutically important molecules contain a hydroxylated or chlorinated quinoline moiety, such as quinine, quinidine, chloro-quine, and montelukast shown in Figure 1. Thus, the hydroxyl group and chlorine atom attached to quinoline represent impor-tant functional groups. In this work, we generated four quinoline derivatives that contain both functional groups at different positions. F. Xu et al. / Tetrahedron Letters 57 (2016) 5262\u20135265 5265 In summary, the expression and purification Rdc2 in E. coli was improved in this work. In vitro reactions of Rdc2 with seven hydroxyquinolines revealed that this halogenase can halogenate four of these substrates. The corresponding products were then prepared through fermentation of the Rdc2-expressing E. coli strain with supplemented substrates. The four products were isolated and structurally characterized based on the UV, MS, and NMR spec-tra. This work represents the first enzymatic preparation of chloro-hydroxyquinolines. The results further expand the reservoir of the acceptable substrates of Rdc2, which makes it a useful biological halogenating agent in the preparation of structurally diverse halo-genated molecules.

        "each product, 1H (Figs. S3\u2013S6), DEPTQ-135 (Figs. S7\u2013S10), HSQC, HMBC, and 1H\u20131H COSY spectra were recorded. The proton and carbon signals were assigned and are listed in Tables 1 and 2.",
        "The 1H NMR spectrum of 3a showed five proton signals, includ-ing two doublet proton signals (d 7.99 and 8.17), an overlapped sig-nal (2H, d 7.63\u20137.70), and a singlet (d 8.62). This is one proton less than the substrate, indicating that one of the CH of 3-hydrox-yquinoline was chlorinated. The 1H\u20131H COSY spectra showed a spin system that consists of the two doublet signals and two over-lapped proton signals, which suggested that the halogenation did not occur on the benzene ring and thus one of the protons on the pyridine ring was substituted by a chlorine atom. This was sup-ported by the presence of the singlet signal, which was assigned to H-2 according to the HMBC correlations (Fig. 4) of this proton to C-4 (d 102.9) and C-8a (d 102.2). Thus, it can be deduced that the halogenation occurred at C-4 position, which is ortho to the hydroxyl group (Fig. 4). This was further supported by the HMBC correlations of H-5 (d 8.17) to C-4. Thus, 3a was identified as 3-hydroxy-4-chloroquinoline.",
        "The 1H and DEPTQ-135 NMR of 5a also showed five CH signals, confirming that one proton of the substrate 5 was chlorinated. The signal of H-2 can be easily located in the low field at d 8.83. Two spin systems were observed in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Fig. 4). The CH\u2013CH\u2013CH system belongs to the pyridine ring, which includes H-2 (d 8.83, d), H-3 (d 7.56, dd), and H-4 (d 8.72, d). The CH-CH system consists of two protons from the benzene ring, including the proton signals at d 7.55 (d) and d 7.68 (d). Thus, we concluded that that one of the protons of the benzene ring was substituted by a chlorine atom. The large coupling constant of 9.0 Hz indicated that the two CH groups are ortho to each other. Accordingly, the possibility of C-7 halogenation can be ruled out. Based on the HMBC correlations of both proton signals at d 7.55 and 7.68 to C-8a at d 143.8 (Fig. 4), the chlorination site was deter-mined to be at C-6. Thus, this product was identified as 5-hydroxy-6-chloroquinoline.",
        "The 1H and DEPTQ-135 NMR spectra of 6a are similar to those of 5a. The signal of H-2 was located in the low field at d 8.80. With this signal, the spin system of H-2/H-3/H-4 was identified by the 1H\u20131H COSY correlations (Fig. 4). The other spin system consists of two doublet signals from the benzene ring that belongs to H-7 and H-8, as suggested by the large coupling constant of 9.0 Hz. Accordingly, it can be deduced that C-5 of 6 was chlorinated. This was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H-4 (d 8.49, d) and H-7 (d 7.58, d) to C-5 at d 112.0. Therefore, 6a was characterized as 5-chloro-6-hydroxyquinoline.",
        "The 1H NMR spectrum of 7a showed five proton signals. The presence of a CH\u2013CH\u2013CH spin system in the 1H\u20131H COSY spectrum (Fig. 4) indicated that none of the protons on the pyridine ring was chlorinated. The 1H\u20131H COSY correlations of H-5 to H-6, which are doublet signals at d 7.79 and 7.34 with a coupling constant of 8.9 Hz, respectively, indicated that Rdc2 introduced a chlorine atom to C-8. The structure was thus characterized as 7-hydroxy-8-chloroquinoline, which was supported by the HMBC correlations shown in Figure 4. 7a is a new compound.",
        "Structural identification of the products 3a, 5a, 6a, and 7a sug-gested that among the seven tested hydroxyquinolines, four were taken by Rdc2 as substrates to form the corresponding monochlo-rinated products. The chlorination reaction is highly specific as the position where the chlorine atom was introduced is ortho to the hydroxyl group of the four substrates. This is consistent with the results for isoquinolines in our previous studies. A number of pharmaceutically important molecules contain a hydroxylated or chlorinated quinoline moiety, such as quinine, quinidine, chloro-quine, and montelukast shown in Figure 1. Thus, the hydroxyl group and chlorine atom attached to quinoline represent impor-tant functional groups. In this work, we generated four quinoline derivatives that contain both functional groups at different positions.",

        "In summary, the expression and purification Rdc2 in E. coli was",
        "improved in this work. In vitro reactions of Rdc2 with seven hydroxyquinolines revealed that this halogenase can halogenate four of these substrates. The corresponding products were then prepared through fermentation of the Rdc2-expressing E. coli strain with supplemented substrates. The four products were isolated and structurally characterized based on the UV, MS, and NMR spec-tra. This work represents the first enzymatic preparation of chloro-hydroxyquinolines. The results further expand the reservoir of the acceptable substrates of Rdc2, which makes it a useful biological halogenating agent in the preparation of structurally diverse halo-genated molecules.",
