Yet, the genetic determinates for pyrroloquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis have remained obscure despite their abundance and deceptive structural simplicity. In this work, we have identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for ammosamides A-C, pyrroloquinoline alka-loids from Streptomyces sp. CNR-698. Through direct cloning, heterologous expression and gene deletions we have validated the ammosamide biosynthetic gene cluster and demonstrated that these seemingly simple molecules are derived from a surprisingly complex set of biosynthetic genes that are also found in the biosynthesis of lymphostin, a structurally related pyrroloquinoline alkaloid from Salinispora and Streptomyces. Our results implicate a conserved set of genes driving pyrroloquinoline biosynthesis that consist of genes frequently associ-ated with ribosomal peptide natural product biosyn-thesis, and whose exact biochemical role remains enigmatic. INTRODUCTION Microbial genome sequencing and genome mining have re-vealed a much greater capacity for secondary metabolite biosynthesis within the genomes ofmicrobial organisms (Bentley et al., 2002; Udwary et al., 2007; Weber, 2014; Zarins-Tutt et al., 2015; Ziemert et al., 2016). This latent capacity is often encoded within so-called orphaned gene clusters for which the chemical product has not been identified. Yet, for many of these orphaned biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), gross structure predictions are possible in the absence of chemical information, especially for the most well-characterized biosynthetic systems, such as polyketides, and non-ribosomal and ribosomal peptides (Boddy, 2014). Although such classes of molecules continue to yield important drug leads, special attention has recently been given 1504 Cell Chemical Biology 23, 1504\u20131514, December 22, 2016 \u00aa 20 to non-canonical BGCs, where structure-defining features cannot be predicted solely from sequence information (Cimer-mancic et al., 2014). Much how the discovery and biochemical characterization of assembly-line biosynthesis has led to the genome mining revolution (Challis, 2008; Corre and Challis, 2009; Walsh and Fischbach, 2010), deciphering the biosynthetic logic of non-canonical biosynthetic pathways will not only yield novel natural products and biochemistry, but also \u2018\u2018inform\u2019\u2019 the bioinformatic tools of future genome mining endeavors. Alkaloids bearing a pyrrolo[4,3,2-de]quinoline core have been the subject of numerous natural product discovery and total synthesis programs for decades because of their potent biolog-ical activity and unique structural features (Figure 1) (Antunes et al., 2005). The vast majority of these molecules have been iso-lated from marine sponges (over 80 examples), which have traditionally been intractable to genetic tools and laboratory cultivation. Consequently, aside from predictions that the pyrro-loquinoline core is derived from tryptophan (Hu et al., 2011), the genes for pyrroloquinoline biosynthesis have not been identi-fied. In 2011, we verified the role of tryptophan in lymphostin biosynthesis and reported on the end-stage biosynthetic events leading to the production of lymphostin in three sequenced strains of the genus Salinispora (Miyanaga et al., 2011). In that work, the O-methylation and two-carbon malonyl extension were attributed to the S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase LymB and the hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase LymA, respectively. But there was no indication that neighboring genes at the lym genetic locus were responsible for the production of the pyrro-loquinoline core. Besides the Salinispora-derived lymphostins, only one other example of bacterial pyrroloquinoline alkaloids has been described. In 2009, Fenical and co-workers reported the isola-tion and characterization of ammosamides A (1) and B (2) from the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. CNR-698 (Hughes et al., 2009). As the ammosamides share the same core struc-tural features of lymphostin (Figure 1), they provide a unique opportunity to explore pyrroloquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis in a distinct genomic context. Herein we show that the marine bac-teria-derived pyrroloquinoline alkaloids lymphostin and the ammosamides are derived from a highly non-canonical biosyn-thetic pathway that more closely resembles the genetic features of ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products (Arnison et al., 2013). 16 Elsevier Ltd.

Direct Capture of the amm Gene Cluster using Transformation-Associated Recombination To directly capture the 37.5-kb region encompassing the ammosamide (amm) BGC, we followed the general procedure described by Yamanaka et al. (2014). Details specific to the TAR capture vector for the ammBGC can be found in the online Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Genetic Manipulations of pCAP01/amm All genetic manipulations of pCAP01/amm were carried out using l Red recombination-mediated PCR-targeted gene deletion, as described by Gust et al. (2003). Individual gene disruption cassettes (for amm3, -4, -7, -8, -9, -11, -14, -16, -17 -18, -19, and -23) were generated via PCR amplification of the apramycin resistance cassette (aac(3)IV) with flanking FRT sites from pMXT19 (Tang et al., 2015). Primers were designed with 39 nucleotidesmatch-ing the adjacent sequences of the targeted gene. Gene replacement by l Red recombination was achieved in E. coli BW25113/pKD20 carrying the pCAP01/ amm construct. Mutated pCAP01/amm constructs were confirmed by restric-tion digest (NcoI) and PCR and then transferred to E. coli BT340 for flippase (FLP) recombinase-mediated excision of the apramycin resistance gene. The corresponding knockouts, with FLP scar were verified by restriction digest and sequencing prior to transfer into S. coelicolor M512. Gene deletion of amm6was carried out in a similar manner as that described in Yamanaka et al. (2012). An aac(3)IV cassette was amplified from pIJ773 by PCR using primers containing two NdeI (CATATG) restriction sites directly adjacent to the 39 nucleotides matching the region flanking amm6, such that the introduction of CATATG preserves the start codon of amm7 for in-frame gene replacement. Replacement of amm6 as described above was achieved in E. coli BW25113/pKD20 carrying pCAP01/amm. Excision of the apramycin resistance cassette from themutant plasmid byNdeI digestion, followed by gel purification and ligation, yielded pCAP01/ammDamm6. Integration of Wild-Type and Mutant pCAP01/amm in S. coelicolor M512 Included in the pCAP01 vector backbone are the4C31 integrase gene (int) and the corresponding attachment site (attP) for integration into S. coelicolor. pCAP01/amm andmutant variants were introduced to E. coli ET12567 by elec-troporation and transferred to S. coelicolor M512 by triparental conjugation facilitated by E. coli ET-12567/pUB307. Kanamycin (Kan)-resistant colonies were grown until sporulation on mannitol soy flour (MS) agar, with Kan and na-lidixic acid (Nal), then plated for a second round of selection on Kan and Nal MS agar plates. Colonies of M512 with chromosomal insertion of pCAP01/ amm were verified by PCR (gDNA isolated from 5-day tryptic soy broth [TSB] cultures). Exconjugants were screened using primer pairs correspond-ing to the sites of gene deletion and the resulting PCR product validated by Sanger sequencing. Spore stocks, which were used for all subsequent cul-tures, were created from a third round of selection on Kan-Nal MS agar plates. For each mutant, three to four individual colonies were selected for secondary metabolite profiling. General Method for Genetic Complementation The pKY01 plasmid, an integrative plasmid with ermE promotor and apramy-cin resistance cassette, was used for genetic complementation experiments, as described previously (Yamanaka et al., 2012). pKY01 constructs were created using either Gibson Cloning or by traditional cloning using the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites of pKY01. The assembled plasmids were validated by restriction digestion and sequence prior to transfer to E. coli ET-12567 for triparental conjugation into designated S. coelicolorM512-pCAP01/ammmu-tants (see above). Exconjugants were selected on MS agar with apramycin (Apra) and Nal, and the colonies allowed to grow to sporulation twice. Primers F-pKY01Sc and R-pKY01Sc were used for screening exconjugants from iso-lated gDNA and Sanger sequencing of the corresponding PCR product. Spore stocks, which were used for all subsequent cultures, were created from a third round of selection on Kan-Nal MS agar plates. For each mutant, three to four individual colonies were selected for secondary metabolite profiling. Design of pKY01/amm6amm7 Mutants Used for Genetic Complementation Due to the overlapping amm6 tryptophan codon (TGG) and amm7 start codon (ATG), we were limited to mutations converting tryptophan to either a stop codon (W56stp) or a cysteine (W56C) residue. These mutants are depicted as \u2018\u2018pKY01/amm6(W56stp)amm7\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018pKY01/amm6(W56C)amm7\u2019\u2019 in this article. As a consequence of amm6-amm7 overlap, mutating the tryptophan codon to a stop codon (TGG/TGA) also converts a valine residue on amm7 to leucine. Similarly, mutating the tryptophan codon to a cysteine codon (TGG/TGC) converts the valine residue on amm7 to methionine. These per-turbations do not appear to affect the outcome of the experiments. Secondary Metabolite Profiling of S. coelicolorM512-pCAP01/amm and Mutants Cultures of S. coelicolor M512-pCAP01/amm and mutant strains were started from 20 mL of spores germinated in 200 mL of 23 YT (yeast extract, tryptone) then added to 3 mL of TSB with Nal and Kan. TSB precultures were grown for 5\u20137 days at 30NoneC, prior to using 0.3 mL to inoculate 15 mL of R5 production medium without antibiotics (Kieser et al., 2000). Production cul-tures were grown for 12 days at 30NoneC and analyzed using the following method: cultures were centrifuged to pellet M512 cells and the resulting supernatant loaded onto a 1 g C18 solid-phase extraction column that was washed, conditioned, and pre-equilibrated at 5% acetonitrile (MeCN). The column was then washed with 6 column volumes of the 5% high-perfor-mance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade acetonitrile to remove salts and polar compounds, and then the entire column flushed with 9 column vol-umes of 85% MeCN. The eluted contents were frozen and the solvent was removed by lyophilization. The lyophilized residue was then dissolved in 0.4 mL of HPLC-grade MeOH and analyzed by LC-MS using a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 mm XB-C18 100 A\u030a, 150 3 4.6 mm column (0\u20133 min isocratic 10% MeCN, 3\u201323 min 10%\u2013100% MeCN; mobile phase buffered with 0.1% for-mic acid). Secondary Metabolite Profiling of S. coelicolor M512-pCAP01/ ammDamm6 Cultures of S. coelicolor M512-pCAP01/ammDamm6, including those geneti-cally complemented with pKY01 constructs, were started from 20 mL of spores germinated in 200 mL of 23 YT then added to 3 mL of TSB with Nal and Apra. TSB precultures were grown for 5\u20137 days at 30NoneC prior to using 1 mL to inoc-ulate 50mL of R5mediumwithout antibiotics. Cultures were grown for 12 days then extracted 3 times with 50 mL of ethyl acetate and concentrated. The re-sulting residue was dissolved in 50 mL of DMSO then diluted with 450 mL of MeCN. This solution was filtered through a 50 mL plug of C18 silica to remove lipophilic components followed by 500 mL of MeCN. The eluate was then analyzed by LC-MS using a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 mm XB-C18 100 A\u030a, 150 3 4.6 mm column (0\u20133 min isocratic 10% MeCN, 3\u201323 min 10%\u2013100% MeCN; mobile phase buffered with 0.1% formic acid). Time Course of Production of Ammosamides A-C Cultures of S. coelicolor M512-pCAP01/amm in R5 medium or Streptomyces sp. CNR-698 in A1were sampled daily starting 1 day following inoculation from TSB preculture or A1 preculture, respectively. Aliquots were diluted with an equal volume of HPLC-grade MeOH, and the 1:1 mixtures were vortexed for 1 min then centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min on a benchtop centrifuge. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.2 mm filter and analyzed by LC-MS using a Phenomenex Luna 5 mm C18(2) 100 A\u030a, 100 3 4.6 mm column (0\u20133 min isocratic 10%MeCN, 2\u201310 min 10%\u2013100%MeCN, 10\u201312 min 100% MeCN; mobile phase buffered with 0.1% formic acid). Chemical Complementation of M512-pCAP01/ammDamm3 Secondary metabolite profiling for chemical complementation experiments was performed as above, with R5 medium supplemented with 6-chloro-D,L-tryptophan. R5 medium solutions were prepared by adding 6-chloro-D,L-tryp-tophan (Chem-Impex International, Cat. 20931) or L-tryptophan (control) to Cell Chemical Biology 23, 1504\u20131514, December 22, 2016 1511 Please cite this article as: Jordan and Moore, Biosynthetic Pathway Connects Cryptic Ribosomally Synthesized Posttranslationally Modified Peptide Genes with Pyrroloquinoline Alkaloids, Cell Chemical Biology (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2016.10.009 a final concentration of 4 mM, prior to autoclave sterilization. The R5 medium was then used as described above for secondary metabolite profiling. Produc-tion cultures were extracted using C18 solid-phase extraction and analyzed by LC-MS using a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 mmXB-C18 100 A\u030a, 1503 4.6mmcol-umn (0\u20133 min isocratic 10% MeCN, 3\u201323 min 10%\u2013100% MeCN; mobile phase buffered with 0.1% formic acid). Production and Isolation of Ammosamide C from M512-pCAP01/amm A 50mL culture of R5mediumwas inoculated with 1mL of preculture of M512-pCAP01/amm (5 days, TSB medium) and allowed to grow for 4 days prior to liquid extraction with n-butanol (33 50 mL). The extracts were concentrated, dissolved in water, and loaded onto a 1 g C18 solid-phase extraction column. Red pigment began to elute with 10%MeCN. The mobile phase was switched to 100% MeOH, and the combined eluate was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was then purified by preparative HPLC using a Phenomenex Synergi 10 mm Hydro-RP 80, 250 3 21.2 mm preparative HPLC column (0\u20131min isocratic 40%MeOH, 1\u201317min 40%\u201365%MeOH; mobile phase buff-ered with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to yield 6.4 mg. LC-MS and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis matched ammosamide C, as reported previously by Hughes and Fenical (2010). Production and Isolation of Compounds 4 and 8 fromM512-pCAP01/ ammDamm3 + pKY01/amm3 Bothmutants,M512-pCAP01/ammDamm4andM512-pCAP01/ammDamm3+ pKY01/amm3, produce compound 4. However, for the isolation of 4, we chose to use M512-pCAP01/ammDamm3 + pKY01/amm3 due to consistently higher titers. Two 1 L cultures of M512-pCAP01/ammDamm3 + pKY01/amm3 were grown for 12 days prior to centrifugation to remove cell debris. The resulting pink-colored supernatant could not be extracted with ethyl acetate or Amberlite XAD7HP resin. Thus, the entire 2 L was passed through a bed of C18 silica gel. The resulting bed was washed thoroughly with water and the pink pigments eluted with 10%\u201380% MeCN. The eluate was then lyophilized, and the resulting crude material was dissolved in 1:1 DMSO:MeOH for preparative HPLC purification with an Agilent Pursuit XRS 5 mm C18, 100 3 21.2 mm preparative HPLC column (0\u20131 min 5% MeCN isocratic, 1\u201325 min 5%\u201350%MeCNat 15mL/minwith amobile phase bufferedwith 0.1% trifluoro-acetic acid).

Production and Isolation of Compounds 6 and 7 fromM512-pCAP01/ ammDamm23 A 1 L culture of M512-pCAP01/ammDamm23 in R5 medium was extracted three times in ethyl acetate (33 1 L), and the combined organics were dried with brine and anhydrousMg2SO4 and then concentrated in vacuo. The result-ing residuewas then dissolved in 1:1 DMSO:MeOH and purified by preparative HPLCwith an Agilent Pursuit XRS 5C18 1003 21.2mmpreparative HPLC col-umn (0\u20131 min 5% MeCN isocratic, 1\u201320 min 5%\u201325% MeCN, at 15 mL/min with a mobile phase buffered with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid).

        "SUMMARY",
        "In an era where natural product biosynthetic gene clusters can be rapidly identified from sequenced ge-nomes, it is unusual for the biosynthesis of an entire natural product class to remain unknown. Yet, the genetic determinates for pyrroloquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis have remained obscure despite their abundance and deceptive structural simplicity. In this work, we have identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for ammosamides A-C, pyrroloquinoline alka-loids from Streptomyces sp. CNR-698. Through direct cloning, heterologous expression and gene deletions we have validated the ammosamide biosynthetic gene cluster and demonstrated that these seemingly simple molecules are derived from a surprisingly complex set of biosynthetic genes that are also found in the biosynthesis of lymphostin, a structurally related pyrroloquinoline alkaloid from Salinispora and Streptomyces. Our results implicate a conserved set of genes driving pyrroloquinoline biosynthesis that consist of genes frequently associ-ated with ribosomal peptide natural product biosyn-thesis, and whose exact biochemical role remains enigmatic.",
        "INTRODUCTION",
        "Microbial genome sequencing and genome mining have re-vealed a much greater capacity for secondary metabolite biosynthesis within the genomes ofmicrobial organisms (Bentley et al., 2002; Udwary et al., 2007; Weber, 2014; Zarins-Tutt et al., 2015; Ziemert et al., 2016). This latent capacity is often encoded within so-called orphaned gene clusters for which the chemical product has not been identified. Yet, for many of these orphaned biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), gross structure predictions are possible in the absence of chemical information, especially for the most well-characterized biosynthetic systems, such as polyketides, and non-ribosomal and ribosomal peptides (Boddy, 2014). Although such classes of molecules continue to yield important drug leads, special attention has recently been given 1504 Cell Chemical Biology 23, 1504\u20131514, December 22, 2016 \u00aa 20",
        "to non-canonical BGCs, where structure-defining features cannot be predicted solely from sequence information (Cimer-mancic et al., 2014). Much how the discovery and biochemical characterization of assembly-line biosynthesis has led to the genome mining revolution (Challis, 2008; Corre and Challis, 2009; Walsh and Fischbach, 2010), deciphering the biosynthetic logic of non-canonical biosynthetic pathways will not only yield novel natural products and biochemistry, but also \u2018\u2018inform\u2019\u2019 the bioinformatic tools of future genome mining endeavors. Alkaloids bearing a pyrrolo[4,3,2-de]quinoline core have been the subject of numerous natural product discovery and total synthesis programs for decades because of their potent biolog-ical activity and unique structural features (Figure 1) (Antunes et al., 2005). The vast majority of these molecules have been iso-lated from marine sponges (over 80 examples), which have traditionally been intractable to genetic tools and laboratory cultivation. Consequently, aside from predictions that the pyrro-loquinoline core is derived from tryptophan (Hu et al., 2011), the genes for pyrroloquinoline biosynthesis have not been identi-fied. In 2011, we verified the role of tryptophan in lymphostin biosynthesis and reported on the end-stage biosynthetic events leading to the production of lymphostin in three sequenced strains of the genus Salinispora (Miyanaga et al., 2011). In that work, the O-methylation and two-carbon malonyl extension were attributed to the S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase LymB and the hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase LymA, respectively. But there was no indication that neighboring genes at the lym genetic locus were responsible for the production of the pyrro-loquinoline core. Besides the Salinispora-derived lymphostins, only one other example of bacterial pyrroloquinoline alkaloids has been described. In 2009, Fenical and co-workers reported the isola-tion and characterization of ammosamides A (1) and B (2) from the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. CNR-698 (Hughes et al., 2009). As the ammosamides share the same core struc-tural features of lymphostin (Figure 1), they provide a unique opportunity to explore pyrroloquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis in a distinct genomic context. Herein we show that the marine bac-teria-derived pyrroloquinoline alkaloids lymphostin and the ammosamides are derived from a highly non-canonical biosyn-thetic pathway that more closely resembles the genetic features of ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products (Arnison et al., 2013). 16 Elsevier Ltd.",

Direct Capture of the amm Gene Cluster using Transformation-Associated Recombination To directly capture the 37.5-kb region encompassing the ammosamide (amm) BGC, we followed the general procedure described by Yamanaka et al. (2014). Details specific to the TAR capture vector for the ammBGC can be found in the online Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Genetic Manipulations of pCAP01/amm All genetic manipulations of pCAP01/amm were carried out using l Red recombination-mediated PCR-targeted gene deletion, as described by Gust et al. (2003). Individual gene disruption cassettes (for amm3, -4, -7, -8, -9, -11, -14, -16, -17 -18, -19, and -23) were generated via PCR amplification of the apramycin resistance cassette (aac(3)IV) with flanking FRT sites from pMXT19 (Tang et al., 2015). Primers were designed with 39 nucleotidesmatch-ing the adjacent sequences of the targeted gene. Gene replacement by l Red recombination was achieved in E. coli BW25113/pKD20 carrying the pCAP01/ amm construct. Mutated pCAP01/amm constructs were confirmed by restric-tion digest (NcoI) and PCR and then transferred to E. coli BT340 for flippase (FLP) recombinase-mediated excision of the apramycin resistance gene. The corresponding knockouts, with FLP scar were verified by restriction digest and sequencing prior to transfer into S. coelicolor M512.",
        "Gene deletion of amm6was carried out in a similar manner as that described in Yamanaka et al. (2012). An aac(3)IV cassette was amplified from pIJ773 by PCR using primers containing two NdeI (CATATG) restriction sites directly adjacent to the 39 nucleotides matching the region flanking amm6, such that the introduction of CATATG preserves the start codon of amm7 for in-frame gene replacement. Replacement of amm6 as described above was achieved in E. coli BW25113/pKD20 carrying pCAP01/amm. Excision of the apramycin resistance cassette from themutant plasmid byNdeI digestion, followed by gel purification and ligation, yielded pCAP01/ammDamm6. Integration of Wild-Type and Mutant pCAP01/amm in S. coelicolor M512 Included in the pCAP01 vector backbone are the4C31 integrase gene (int) and the corresponding attachment site (attP) for integration into S. coelicolor. pCAP01/amm andmutant variants were introduced to E. coli ET12567 by elec-troporation and transferred to S. coelicolor M512 by triparental conjugation facilitated by E. coli ET-12567/pUB307. Kanamycin (Kan)-resistant colonies were grown until sporulation on mannitol soy flour (MS) agar, with Kan and na-lidixic acid (Nal), then plated for a second round of selection on Kan and Nal MS agar plates. Colonies of M512 with chromosomal insertion of pCAP01/ amm were verified by PCR (gDNA isolated from 5-day tryptic soy broth [TSB] cultures). Exconjugants were screened using primer pairs correspond-ing to the sites of gene deletion and the resulting PCR product validated by Sanger sequencing. Spore stocks, which were used for all subsequent cul-tures, were created from a third round of selection on Kan-Nal MS agar plates. For each mutant, three to four individual colonies were selected for secondary metabolite profiling. General Method for Genetic Complementation The pKY01 plasmid, an integrative plasmid with ermE promotor and apramy-cin resistance cassette, was used for genetic complementation experiments, as described previously (Yamanaka et al., 2012). pKY01 constructs were created using either Gibson Cloning or by traditional cloning using the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites of pKY01. The assembled plasmids were validated by restriction digestion and sequence prior to transfer to E. coli ET-12567 for triparental conjugation into designated S. coelicolorM512-pCAP01/ammmu-tants (see above). Exconjugants were selected on MS agar with apramycin (Apra) and Nal, and the colonies allowed to grow to sporulation twice. Primers F-pKY01Sc and R-pKY01Sc were used for screening exconjugants from iso-lated gDNA and Sanger sequencing of the corresponding PCR product. Spore",
        "stocks, which were used for all subsequent cultures, were created from a third round of selection on Kan-Nal MS agar plates. For each mutant, three to four individual colonies were selected for secondary metabolite profiling. Design of pKY01/amm6amm7 Mutants Used for Genetic Complementation Due to the overlapping amm6 tryptophan codon (TGG) and amm7 start codon (ATG), we were limited to mutations converting tryptophan to either a stop codon (W56stp) or a cysteine (W56C) residue. These mutants are depicted as \u2018\u2018pKY01/amm6(W56stp)amm7\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018pKY01/amm6(W56C)amm7\u2019\u2019 in this article. As a consequence of amm6-amm7 overlap, mutating the tryptophan codon to a stop codon (TGG/TGA) also converts a valine residue on amm7 to leucine. Similarly, mutating the tryptophan codon to a cysteine codon (TGG/TGC) converts the valine residue on amm7 to methionine. These per-turbations do not appear to affect the outcome of the experiments. Secondary Metabolite Profiling of S. coelicolorM512-pCAP01/amm and Mutants Cultures of S. coelicolor M512-pCAP01/amm and mutant strains were started from 20 mL of spores germinated in 200 mL of 23 YT (yeast extract, tryptone) then added to 3 mL of TSB with Nal and Kan. TSB precultures were grown for 5\u20137 days at 30NoneC, prior to using 0.3 mL to inoculate 15 mL of R5 production medium without antibiotics (Kieser et al., 2000). Production cul-tures were grown for 12 days at 30NoneC and analyzed using the following method: cultures were centrifuged to pellet M512 cells and the resulting supernatant loaded onto a 1 g C18 solid-phase extraction column that was washed, conditioned, and pre-equilibrated at 5% acetonitrile (MeCN). The column was then washed with 6 column volumes of the 5% high-perfor-mance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade acetonitrile to remove salts and polar compounds, and then the entire column flushed with 9 column vol-umes of 85% MeCN. The eluted contents were frozen and the solvent was removed by lyophilization. The lyophilized residue was then dissolved in 0.4 mL of HPLC-grade MeOH and analyzed by LC-MS using a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 mm XB-C18 100 A\u030a, 150 3 4.6 mm column (0\u20133 min isocratic 10% MeCN, 3\u201323 min 10%\u2013100% MeCN; mobile phase buffered with 0.1% for-mic acid). Secondary Metabolite Profiling of S. coelicolor M512-pCAP01/ ammDamm6 Cultures of S. coelicolor M512-pCAP01/ammDamm6, including those geneti-cally complemented with pKY01 constructs, were started from 20 mL of spores germinated in 200 mL of 23 YT then added to 3 mL of TSB with Nal and Apra. TSB precultures were grown for 5\u20137 days at 30NoneC prior to using 1 mL to inoc-ulate 50mL of R5mediumwithout antibiotics. Cultures were grown for 12 days then extracted 3 times with 50 mL of ethyl acetate and concentrated. The re-sulting residue was dissolved in 50 mL of DMSO then diluted with 450 mL of MeCN. This solution was filtered through a 50 mL plug of C18 silica to remove lipophilic components followed by 500 mL of MeCN. The eluate was then analyzed by LC-MS using a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 mm XB-C18 100 A\u030a, 150 3 4.6 mm column (0\u20133 min isocratic 10% MeCN, 3\u201323 min 10%\u2013100% MeCN; mobile phase buffered with 0.1% formic acid). Time Course of Production of Ammosamides A-C Cultures of S. coelicolor M512-pCAP01/amm in R5 medium or Streptomyces sp. CNR-698 in A1were sampled daily starting 1 day following inoculation from TSB preculture or A1 preculture, respectively. Aliquots were diluted with an equal volume of HPLC-grade MeOH, and the 1:1 mixtures were vortexed for 1 min then centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min on a benchtop centrifuge. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.2 mm filter and analyzed by LC-MS using a Phenomenex Luna 5 mm C18(2) 100 A\u030a, 100 3 4.6 mm column (0\u20133 min isocratic 10%MeCN, 2\u201310 min 10%\u2013100%MeCN, 10\u201312 min 100% MeCN; mobile phase buffered with 0.1% formic acid). Chemical Complementation of M512-pCAP01/ammDamm3 Secondary metabolite profiling for chemical complementation experiments was performed as above, with R5 medium supplemented with 6-chloro-D,L-tryptophan. R5 medium solutions were prepared by adding 6-chloro-D,L-tryp-tophan (Chem-Impex International, Cat. 20931) or L-tryptophan (control) to Cell Chemical Biology 23, 1504\u20131514, December 22, 2016 1511",

        "a final concentration of 4 mM, prior to autoclave sterilization. The R5 medium was then used as described above for secondary metabolite profiling. Produc-tion cultures were extracted using C18 solid-phase extraction and analyzed by LC-MS using a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 mmXB-C18 100 A\u030a, 1503 4.6mmcol-umn (0\u20133 min isocratic 10% MeCN, 3\u201323 min 10%\u2013100% MeCN; mobile phase buffered with 0.1% formic acid). Production and Isolation of Ammosamide C from M512-pCAP01/amm A 50mL culture of R5mediumwas inoculated with 1mL of preculture of M512-pCAP01/amm (5 days, TSB medium) and allowed to grow for 4 days prior to liquid extraction with n-butanol (33 50 mL). The extracts were concentrated, dissolved in water, and loaded onto a 1 g C18 solid-phase extraction column. Red pigment began to elute with 10%MeCN. The mobile phase was switched to 100% MeOH, and the combined eluate was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was then purified by preparative HPLC using a Phenomenex Synergi 10 mm Hydro-RP 80, 250 3 21.2 mm preparative HPLC column (0\u20131min isocratic 40%MeOH, 1\u201317min 40%\u201365%MeOH; mobile phase buff-ered with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to yield 6.4 mg. LC-MS and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis matched ammosamide C, as reported previously by Hughes and Fenical (2010). Production and Isolation of Compounds 4 and 8 fromM512-pCAP01/ ammDamm3 + pKY01/amm3 Bothmutants,M512-pCAP01/ammDamm4andM512-pCAP01/ammDamm3+ pKY01/amm3, produce compound 4. However, for the isolation of 4, we chose to use M512-pCAP01/ammDamm3 + pKY01/amm3 due to consistently higher titers. Two 1 L cultures of M512-pCAP01/ammDamm3 + pKY01/amm3 were grown for 12 days prior to centrifugation to remove cell debris. The resulting pink-colored supernatant could not be extracted with ethyl acetate or Amberlite XAD7HP resin. Thus, the entire 2 L was passed through a bed of C18 silica gel. The resulting bed was washed thoroughly with water and the pink pigments eluted with 10%\u201380% MeCN. The eluate was then lyophilized, and the resulting crude material was dissolved in 1:1 DMSO:MeOH for preparative HPLC purification with an Agilent Pursuit XRS 5 mm C18, 100 3 21.2 mm preparative HPLC column (0\u20131 min 5% MeCN isocratic, 1\u201325 min 5%\u201350%MeCNat 15mL/minwith amobile phase bufferedwith 0.1% trifluoro-acetic acid).
