SCSIO 03032. Inactivation of spmH led to six deschloro-analogues of TDs, including four new compounds SPMs G (1) and H (2), and IDMs F (3) and G (4). The structures and absol-ute configurations of 1\u20134 were unambiguously determined by the combination of extensive spectroscopic analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and quantum chemical ECD calculations. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against four cancer cell lines. Additionally, SpmH was biochemi-cally characterized in vitro as an L-tryptophan 5-halogenase. Tryptophan dimers (TDs) are a distinct class of natural pro-ducts and have attracted significant attention in drug develop-ment due to their diverse structures and promising biological activities.1\u20133 Several TD analogues are currently in clinical use or clinical trials for cancer therapies.4,5 For example, midos-taurin, featuring a deschloro indolocarbazole scaffold, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of FLT3-ITD mutation in acute myeloid leuke-mia.6 The biosynthetic studies on TDs have been rigorously carried out during the last two decades to reveal that various skeletons of TDs are derived from the oxidative dimerization of L-tryptophan with further tailoring modifications.7 We have previously shown that deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 could produce a diverse set of unique TDs, such as spiroindimicins (SPMs)8,9 featuring unique [5,5] or [5,6] spiro-rings, indimicins (IDMs)10 bearing an unusual dimethyl-hydroindole moiety, and lynamicins (LNMs).10 Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 could also produce piericidins and heronamides (Fig. S1\u2020).11,12 Recently, a set of biosynthetic genes spmRAODPFHX2 were identified and charac-terized to be involved in the biosynthesis of SPMs and IDMs by bioinformatics analysis, targeted gene disruptions, and het-erologous expression studies.13 Similar biosynthetic genes were also found in another marine-derived Streptomyces sp. MP131-18.14 However, key enzymes responsible for assembling the unusual spiro scaffold of SPMs and the dearomatized skel-eton of IDMs were indicated to be encoded by genes outside of the identified spm gene cluster.13 Nonetheless, a halogenase SpmH was proposed to catalyze the 5-halogenation of L-tryptophan (L-Trp) to provide the chlorines in SPMs and IDMs.13 Herein, we report the functional characterization of SpmH as an L-Trp 5-halogenase by in vivo gene inactivation experiments and in vitro enzyme assays. Seven deschloro metabolites were identi-fied from the \u0394spmH mutant, including four new TDs, SPMs G (1) and H (2), and IDMs F (3) and G (4) (Fig. 1). Biochemically, SpmH was characterized to catalyze the 5-chlorination of L-Trp but not the chlorination of non-halogenated SPM/IDM analogues, suggesting that halogenation occurs as an earlier biosynthetic step in SPMs/IDMs, similar to other halogenated TDs.15 Previous bioinformatics analysis showed that SpmH was a putative halogenase with significant similarity to PyrH, an L-Trp 5-halogenase involved in pyrroindomycin biosyn-thesis.13,16 To verify its function, the encoding gene spmH was inactivated by insertional mutation with an apramycin-resist-ant gene cassette via a PCR-targeting method in Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 to afford the \u0394spmH mutant (Fig. S2\u2020). In comparison with the wild type strain, the \u0394spmH mutant dis-played a different metabolite profile (Fig. 2). Subsequently, 20 L of fermentation cultures of the \u0394spmH mutant were collected and subjected to acetone extraction and macroporous resin (Amberlite XAD-16) absorption. After multiple steps of chroma-tographic separation, seven pure compounds (1\u20137) were iso-lated, including four new compounds SPMs G (1) and H (2), \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: The experimental pro-cedures, materials, and characterization of new compounds.

Its molecular formula was assigned as C25H21N3O4 by HRESIMS (m/z 428.1610 [M + H]+, calcd for C25H22N3O4, 428.1605, Fig. S4\u2020), indicating the presence of 17 degrees of unsatura-tion. The IR spectrum of 1 (Fig. S4\u2020) displayed absorptions attributable to conjugated carbonyl (1699 cm-1), the double bond (1680 cm-1), and the benzene ring (1603, 1435 cm-1). The NMR spectra of 1 (Table 1 and Fig. S4\u2020), were highly similar to those of SPM D (10).8 A careful comparison revealed that the two chlorines at C-6\u2032 and C-6\u2033 in SPM D (10) were absent in 1, which was supported by its molecular formula and the COSY correlations of H-5\u2032/H-6\u2032/H-7\u2032/H-8\u2032 and H-5\u2033/H-6\u2033/H-7\u2033/H-8\u2033 (Fig. 3). Thus, the planar structure of 1 was determined to be deschloro-SPM D. Based on the good agreement of the electric circular dichroism (ECD) spectra of 1 and 10 (Fig. S4\u2020),8 the absolute configuration of 1 was deduced to be 3\u2032R, the same as that of SPM D (10). This assignment was verified by the com-parison of the experimental ECD curve of 1 with the calculated ECD curves of two enantiomers (3\u2032S)-1 and (3\u2032R)-1 using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level.20 The experimental ECD spectrum of 1 also agreed with the calculated ECD spectrum of (3\u2032R)-1 (Fig. 4a), confirming the absolute configuration of 1 as 3\u2032R. The molecular formula of SPM H (2) was assigned to be C25H21N3O4 by HRESIMS (m/z 428.1599 [M + H] +, calcd for C25H22N3O4, 428.1605, Fig. S5\u2020). A comprehensive comparison of the NMR data of 2 (Table 1 and Fig. S5\u2020) and SPM A (8)8 revealed their high similarity. SPM H (2) was different from SPM A (8) by the presence of characteristic resonances for N-methyl (\u03b4H 2.95, 1H, s; \u03b4C 35.6), N-methylene (\u03b4H 3.93, 1H, d, J = 8.6 Hz; \u03b4H 3.83, 1H, d, J = 8.6 Hz; \u03b4C 74.6), and two ortho-di-substituted benzene rings, and the absence of a methylene and two 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene rings. Based on this com-parison, 2 was deduced to be an N-1\u2032 methylated and des-chloro derivative of SPM A (8). The presence of the N-1\u2032 methyl group was supported by key HMBC correlations from H-2\u2032 to C-10\u2032, and from H-10\u2032 to C-9\u2032. The absence of two chlorines at C-6\u2032 and C-6\u2033 in 2 was supported by the COSY correlations (H-5\u2032/H-6\u2032/H-7\u2032/H-8\u2032 and H-5\u2033/H-6\u2033/H-7\u2033/H-8\u2033) and HMBC corre-lations (H-6\u2032/C-4\u2032 and H-6\u2033/C-4\u2033). Thus, the planar structure of 2 was determined as shown in Fig. 3. The absolute configur-ation of 2 was established by comparison of the experimental ECD spectrum of 2 with the calculated ECD spectra of two enantiomers (3\u2032S-2 and 3\u2032R-2, Fig. 4b). Since the calculated ECD spectrum of (3\u2032S)-2 matched well with the experimental one, the absolute configuration of 2 was assigned to be 3\u2032S. IDM F (3) was obtained as colorless block crystals. Its mole-cular formula of C23H21N3O2 was established by HRESIMS (m/ z 394.1530 [M + Na]+, calcd for C23H21N3O2Na, 394.1526, Fig. S6\u2020). Its IR spectrum (Fig. S6\u2020) revealed the absorption bands corresponding to hydroxyl (3362 cm-1), conjugated car-bonyl (1688 cm-1) and the benzene ring (1605, 1435 cm-1). A comprehensive analysis of the NMR data of 3 (Table 1 and Fig. S6\u2020) indicated the structure similarity of 3 and IDM A (11).10 The large difference between 3 and IDM A (11) was in the pyrrole ring moiety. A 1-methyl-3,4-disubstituted pyrrole ring was present in IDM A (11). In contrast, a pyrrolinone unit (3a) was established in 3 by HMBC correlations from H-5 to Fig. 2 Comparative HPLC analysis of metabolite profiles (a) and the chemical structures of metabolites from the wild type (WT) strain Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 (b). (i) The spmH gene inactivation mutant \u0394spmH; (ii) the wild type strain; UV detection at 254 nm. The compounds denoted by the symbols  and \u25cf putatively denoted des-chloro-IDM A and deschloro-IDM B, respectively, which were deduced from the UV and mass spectra (Fig. S3\u2020). Both compounds were not sub-jected to structural elucidation due to instability during isolation. Similarly, previously reported indimicins10 were also found to be unstable.

Compound 3 also exhibited NMR signals for two ortho-disubstituted benzene rings (Table 1), indicating that 3 was a 6\u2032,6\u2033-dideschloro-derivative of IDM A (11). This assignment was supported by the COSY correlations of H-5\u2032/H-6\u2032/H-7\u2032/H-8\u2032 and H-5\u2033/H-6\u2033/H-7\u2033/H-8\u2033 (Fig. 3). Other key HMBC correlations assembled the units 3b and 3c (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The connec-tion of units 3a/3b/3c through C-4/C-3\u2032 and C2\u2032/C-2\u2033 was sup-ported by HMBC correlations from H-2\u2032 to C-4/C-3\u2033 and from Me-11\u2032 to C-4. The NOESY correlation of Me-11\u2032/H-2\u2032 was observed (Fig. 3), placing these protons at the same side of the 5 membered ring in unit 3b. Finally, a crystal of 3 was obtained for single-crystal X-ray diffraction with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (CCDC 1873447\u2020), allowing unambiguous assignment of its absolute configuration as 5S,2\u2032S,3\u2032S (Fig. 5) with a Flack parameter of 0.05(7). The molecular formula of IDM G (4) was determined as C24H23N3O2 by HRESIMS (m/z 384.1718 [M -H]-, calcd for C24H22N3O2, 384.1722, Fig. S7\u2020). The 1D NMR spectra of 4 and 3 were very similar (Table 1 and Fig. S7\u2020). IDM G (4) only differed from 3 in the substituted pyrrolinone moiety: (1) the keto group was located at C-5 (\u03b4C 168.1) in 4, instead of being at C-2 in 3 (\u03b4C 83.0); (2) a tertiary methyl (\u03b4H 1.72, 3H, s; \u03b4C 22.9) was placed at the hydroxylated quaternary carbon C-2 (\u03b4C 87.7, C-2), which was confirmed by HMBC correlations from Me-11 to C-3 and from Me-10 to C-5/C-2, and further sup-ported by the NOE correlation between Me-11 and H-5\u2033 Table 1 1H and 13C NMR data of 1\u20134 (\u03b4 in ppm, J in Hz)a 1b 2b 3c 4b No. \u03b4H mult.

In contrast, a hydroxyl methine was present at C-5 in 3. The syn configuration of Me-11\u2032 and H-2\u2032 was assigned by the key NOE correlation of Me-11\u2032/H-2\u2032 (Fig. 3). Based on the same biosynthetic origin of 3 and 4, the absolute configur-ations of C-2\u2032 and C-3\u2032 in 4 were deduced as 2\u2032S,3\u2032S. Finally, the absolute configuration of 4 was determined to be 2S,2\u2032S,3\u2032S by comparison of the experimental ECD curve 4 with the calcu-lated ECD curves of two possible configurations (2S,2\u2032S,3\u2032S and 2R,2\u2032S,3\u2032S; Fig. 4c). Compounds 1\u20137 were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines (SF-268, MCF-7, HepG2 and A549). It was shown that 1 and 2 exhibited moderate cytotoxic effects against the four cancer cell lines, comparable to their chlorinated analogues SPMs A (8) and D (10) (Table 2).8 This observation indicated that chlorination of SPMs exerted little effects on the cytotoxicity. Our in vivo data suggested that SpmH was a halogenase. To probe its function and substrates in vitro, SpmH was overpro-duced in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as a soluble His6-tagged protein (Fig. S11\u2020). Subsequent incubation of L-Trp (20) and SpmH led to the conversion of L-Trp (20) to 21 (Fig. 6, trace i), in the presence of NaCl, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and dithiothreitol (DTT, a redox reagent to in situ reduce FAD to FADH2, 21,22 Fig. 6). Product 21 was character-ized as 5-Cl-L-Trp by comparison of the UV/ESIMS spectra and the retention time with the standard (Fig. S12 and 13\u2020).

View Article Further experiments showed that the yield of product 21 increased with a longer incubation time in a typical SpmH enzyme assay (Fig. S13\u2020). No conversion of L-Trp (20) was observed in control assays lacking either SpmH or FAD (Fig. 6, traces ii & iii). A trace amount of product 21 was observed in assays lacking DTT (Fig. 6, trace iv) or lacking NaCl (Fig. 6, trace v) due to the presence of DDT and Cl-in the storage buffer and the protein purification system.16,23 However, none of the compounds 1\u20137 were detected as putative substrates for SpmH (Fig. S14\u2020). These observations unequivocally confirmed that SpmH catalyzed the conversion of L-Trp (20) to 5-Cl-L-Trp (21) during the early steps in the biosynthesis of SPMs/IDMs. Conclusions In summary, four new TDs, SPMs G (1) and H (2), and IDMs F (3) and G (4), together with 3 known compounds 5\u20137 were iso-lated from the spmH gene inactivation mutant of Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032. The structure elucidation of these metab-olites demonstrated that they were deschloro-analogues of SPM/IDMs. SPMs 1 and 2 exhibited moderate cytotoxic effects against four cancer cell lines. Subsequently, in vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that the flavin-dependent enzyme SpmH was an L-Trp 5-halogenase, while deschloro SPMs/IDMs were not substrates for SpmH. Our study highlights the inactivation of functional biosynthetic genes in marine actinomycetes as an effective strategy for the discovery of novel natural products.

        "The halogenase gene spmH was putatively involved in the biosyn-thesis of spiroindimicins/indimicins (SPMs/IDMs), a group of chlori-nated tryptophan dimers (TDs) from deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032. Inactivation of spmH led to six deschloro-analogues of TDs, including four new compounds SPMs G (1) and H (2), and IDMs F (3) and G (4). The structures and absol-ute configurations of 1\u20134 were unambiguously determined by the combination of extensive spectroscopic analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and quantum chemical ECD calculations. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against four cancer cell lines. Additionally, SpmH was biochemi-cally characterized in vitro as an L-tryptophan 5-halogenase.",
        "Tryptophan dimers (TDs) are a distinct class of natural pro-ducts and have attracted significant attention in drug develop-ment due to their diverse structures and promising biological activities.1\u20133 Several TD analogues are currently in clinical use or clinical trials for cancer therapies.4,5 For example, midos-taurin, featuring a deschloro indolocarbazole scaffold, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of FLT3-ITD mutation in acute myeloid leuke-mia.6 The biosynthetic studies on TDs have been rigorously carried out during the last two decades to reveal that various skeletons of TDs are derived from the oxidative dimerization of L-tryptophan with further tailoring modifications.7",
        "We have previously shown that deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 could produce a diverse set of",
        "unique TDs, such as spiroindimicins (SPMs)8,9 featuring unique [5,5] or [5,6] spiro-rings, indimicins (IDMs)10 bearing an unusual dimethyl-hydroindole moiety, and lynamicins (LNMs).10 Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 could also produce piericidins and heronamides (Fig. S1\u2020).11,12 Recently, a set of biosynthetic genes spmRAODPFHX2 were identified and charac-terized to be involved in the biosynthesis of SPMs and IDMs by bioinformatics analysis, targeted gene disruptions, and het-erologous expression studies.13 Similar biosynthetic genes were also found in another marine-derived Streptomyces sp. MP131-18.14 However, key enzymes responsible for assembling the unusual spiro scaffold of SPMs and the dearomatized skel-eton of IDMs were indicated to be encoded by genes outside of the identified spm gene cluster.13 Nonetheless, a halogenase SpmH was proposed to catalyze the 5-halogenation of L-tryptophan (L-Trp) to provide the chlorines in SPMs and IDMs.13 Herein, we report the functional characterization of SpmH as an L-Trp 5-halogenase by in vivo gene inactivation experiments and in vitro enzyme assays. Seven deschloro metabolites were identi-fied from the \u0394spmH mutant, including four new TDs, SPMs G (1) and H (2), and IDMs F (3) and G (4) (Fig. 1). Biochemically, SpmH was characterized to catalyze the 5-chlorination of L-Trp but not the chlorination of non-halogenated SPM/IDM analogues, suggesting that halogenation occurs as an earlier biosynthetic step in SPMs/IDMs, similar to other halogenated TDs.15 Previous bioinformatics analysis showed that SpmH was a putative halogenase with significant similarity to PyrH, an L-Trp 5-halogenase involved in pyrroindomycin biosyn-thesis.13,16 To verify its function, the encoding gene spmH was inactivated by insertional mutation with an apramycin-resist-ant gene cassette via a PCR-targeting method in Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032 to afford the \u0394spmH mutant (Fig. S2\u2020). In comparison with the wild type strain, the \u0394spmH mutant dis-played a different metabolite profile (Fig. 2). Subsequently, 20 L of fermentation cultures of the \u0394spmH mutant were collected and subjected to acetone extraction and macroporous resin (Amberlite XAD-16) absorption. After multiple steps of chroma-tographic separation, seven pure compounds (1\u20137) were iso-lated, including four new compounds SPMs G (1) and H (2),",

        "(m/z 428.1610 [M + H]+, calcd for C25H22N3O4, 428.1605, Fig. S4\u2020), indicating the presence of 17 degrees of unsatura-tion. The IR spectrum of 1 (Fig. S4\u2020) displayed absorptions attributable to conjugated carbonyl (1699 cm-1), the double bond (1680 cm-1), and the benzene ring (1603, 1435 cm-1). The NMR spectra of 1 (Table 1 and Fig. S4\u2020), were highly similar to those of SPM D (10).8 A careful comparison revealed that the two chlorines at C-6\u2032 and C-6\u2033 in SPM D (10) were absent in 1, which was supported by its molecular formula and the COSY correlations of H-5\u2032/H-6\u2032/H-7\u2032/H-8\u2032 and H-5\u2033/H-6\u2033/H-7\u2033/H-8\u2033 (Fig. 3). Thus, the planar structure of 1 was determined to be deschloro-SPM D. Based on the good agreement of the electric circular dichroism (ECD) spectra of 1 and 10 (Fig. S4\u2020),8 the absolute configuration of 1 was deduced to be 3\u2032R, the same as that of SPM D (10). This assignment was verified by the com-parison of the experimental ECD curve of 1 with the calculated ECD curves of two enantiomers (3\u2032S)-1 and (3\u2032R)-1 using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level.20 The experimental ECD spectrum of 1 also agreed with the calculated ECD spectrum of (3\u2032R)-1 (Fig. 4a), confirming the absolute configuration of 1 as 3\u2032R. The molecular formula of SPM H (2) was assigned to be C25H21N3O4 by HRESIMS (m/z 428.1599 [M + H] +, calcd for C25H22N3O4, 428.1605, Fig. S5\u2020). A comprehensive comparison of the NMR data of 2 (Table 1 and Fig. S5\u2020) and SPM A (8)8 revealed their high similarity. SPM H (2) was different from SPM A (8) by the presence of characteristic resonances for N-methyl (\u03b4H 2.95, 1H, s; \u03b4C 35.6), N-methylene (\u03b4H 3.93, 1H, d, J = 8.6 Hz; \u03b4H 3.83, 1H, d, J = 8.6 Hz; \u03b4C 74.6), and two ortho-di-substituted benzene rings, and the absence of a methylene and two 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene rings. Based on this com-parison, 2 was deduced to be an N-1\u2032 methylated and des-chloro derivative of SPM A (8). The presence of the N-1\u2032 methyl group was supported by key HMBC correlations from H-2\u2032 to C-10\u2032, and from H-10\u2032 to C-9\u2032. The absence of two chlorines at C-6\u2032 and C-6\u2033 in 2 was supported by the COSY correlations (H-5\u2032/H-6\u2032/H-7\u2032/H-8\u2032 and H-5\u2033/H-6\u2033/H-7\u2033/H-8\u2033) and HMBC corre-lations (H-6\u2032/C-4\u2032 and H-6\u2033/C-4\u2033). Thus, the planar structure of 2 was determined as shown in Fig. 3. The absolute configur-ation of 2 was established by comparison of the experimental ECD spectrum of 2 with the calculated ECD spectra of two enantiomers (3\u2032S-2 and 3\u2032R-2, Fig. 4b). Since the calculated ECD spectrum of (3\u2032S)-2 matched well with the experimental one, the absolute configuration of 2 was assigned to be 3\u2032S. IDM F (3) was obtained as colorless block crystals. Its mole-cular formula of C23H21N3O2 was established by HRESIMS (m/ z 394.1530 [M + Na]+, calcd for C23H21N3O2Na, 394.1526, Fig. S6\u2020). Its IR spectrum (Fig. S6\u2020) revealed the absorption bands corresponding to hydroxyl (3362 cm-1), conjugated car-bonyl (1688 cm-1) and the benzene ring (1605, 1435 cm-1). A comprehensive analysis of the NMR data of 3 (Table 1 and Fig. S6\u2020) indicated the structure similarity of 3 and IDM A (11).10 The large difference between 3 and IDM A (11) was in the pyrrole ring moiety. A 1-methyl-3,4-disubstituted pyrrole ring was present in IDM A (11). In contrast, a pyrrolinone unit (3a) was established in 3 by HMBC correlations from H-5 to",

        "a 6\u2032,6\u2033-dideschloro-derivative of IDM A (11). This assignment was supported by the COSY correlations of H-5\u2032/H-6\u2032/H-7\u2032/H-8\u2032 and H-5\u2033/H-6\u2033/H-7\u2033/H-8\u2033 (Fig. 3). Other key HMBC correlations assembled the units 3b and 3c (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The connec-tion of units 3a/3b/3c through C-4/C-3\u2032 and C2\u2032/C-2\u2033 was sup-ported by HMBC correlations from H-2\u2032 to C-4/C-3\u2033 and from Me-11\u2032 to C-4. The NOESY correlation of Me-11\u2032/H-2\u2032 was observed (Fig. 3), placing these protons at the same side of the 5 membered ring in unit 3b. Finally, a crystal of 3 was obtained for single-crystal X-ray diffraction with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (CCDC 1873447\u2020), allowing unambiguous assignment of its absolute configuration as 5S,2\u2032S,3\u2032S (Fig. 5) with a Flack parameter of 0.05(7). The molecular formula of IDM G (4) was determined as C24H23N3O2 by HRESIMS (m/z 384.1718 [M -H]-, calcd for C24H22N3O2, 384.1722, Fig. S7\u2020). The 1D NMR spectra of 4 and 3 were very similar (Table 1 and Fig. S7\u2020). IDM G (4) only differed from 3 in the substituted pyrrolinone moiety: (1) the keto group was located at C-5 (\u03b4C 168.1) in 4, instead of being at C-2 in 3 (\u03b4C 83.0); (2) a tertiary methyl (\u03b4H 1.72, 3H, s; \u03b4C 22.9) was placed at the hydroxylated quaternary carbon C-2 (\u03b4C 87.7, C-2), which was confirmed by HMBC correlations from Me-11 to C-3 and from Me-10 to C-5/C-2, and further sup-ported by the NOE correlation between Me-11 and H-5\u2033",

        "Further experiments showed that the yield of product 21 increased with a longer incubation time in a typical SpmH enzyme assay (Fig. S13\u2020). No conversion of L-Trp (20) was observed in control assays lacking either SpmH or FAD (Fig. 6, traces ii & iii). A trace amount of product 21 was observed in assays lacking DTT (Fig. 6, trace iv) or lacking NaCl (Fig. 6, trace v) due to the presence of DDT and Cl-in the storage buffer and the protein purification system.16,23 However, none of the compounds 1\u20137 were detected as putative substrates for SpmH (Fig. S14\u2020). These observations unequivocally confirmed that SpmH catalyzed the conversion of L-Trp (20) to 5-Cl-L-Trp (21) during the early steps in the biosynthesis of SPMs/IDMs.",
        "Conclusions In summary, four new TDs, SPMs G (1) and H (2), and IDMs F (3) and G (4), together with 3 known compounds 5\u20137 were iso-lated from the spmH gene inactivation mutant of Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032. The structure elucidation of these metab-olites demonstrated that they were deschloro-analogues of SPM/IDMs. SPMs 1 and 2 exhibited moderate cytotoxic effects against four cancer cell lines. Subsequently, in vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that the flavin-dependent enzyme SpmH was an L-Trp 5-halogenase, while deschloro SPMs/IDMs were not substrates for SpmH. Our study highlights the inactivation of functional biosynthetic genes in marine actinomycetes as an effective strategy for the discovery of novel natural products.",
