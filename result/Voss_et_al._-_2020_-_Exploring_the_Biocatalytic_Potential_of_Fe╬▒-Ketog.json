KGaA, Weinheim7336 Chemistry\u2014A European Journal Concept doi.org/10.1002/chem.201905752 Abstract: Freestanding Fe/a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases are oxidoreductases that catalyze the installa-tion of halogen atoms into unactivated sp3-hybridized carbon centers with high stereo-and regioselectivity. Since their discovery in 2014, a small number of indole al-kaloid and amino acid halogenases have been identified and characterized. First enzyme engineering examples suggest that the accessible substrate range of these en-zymes may be expanded through the use of rational enzyme design and directed evolution. Structural investi-gations of non-heme iron halogenases acting on free-standing as well as tethered substrates are beginning to inform about the principles of the underlying halogena-tion mechanism. Introduction The number of employed biocatalytic steps in industrial pro-cesses is continuously increasing and today enzymes are rou-tinely used to catalyze a variety of chemical transformations, prominent examples including the synthesis of chiral alcohols and amines.[1] The manufacturing processes benefit from the high regio-and stereoselectivity of the\u2014typically engineered\u2014biocata-lysts, enabling the selective chemical synthesis while reducing associated protection, deprotection, and purification steps.[2] As the discipline of biocatalysis is maturing, scientists turn to improve the technological readiness of intrinsically more com-plex enzyme classes and begin to tap into novel reactivities that go well beyond the current state-of-the-art. Especially C@ H activating enzymes such as halogenases are interesting tar-gets as they are valuable tools for the production of high-value compounds such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemi-cals.[3] The substitution of a hydrogen with a halogen atom alters a molecule\u2019s properties and affects its pharmacokinetics as well as its biological activity. Unsurprisingly, around 20 % of small molecule drugs and 30 % of agrochemicals are halogenated.[4] In addition, organic halides are useful synthetic handles for functional group transformations and\u2014if installed on aromatic moieties\u2014for the formation of C@C bonds.[5] However, al-though halogenated compounds find wide application in aca-demia and industry, the chemical synthesis of organic halides remains challenging and traditionally require alcohols, alkenes, and acid containing compounds as precursors. Even modern approaches only offer few methods for the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)@H bonds, which typically place specific de-mands on substrate structure and may suffer from lack of ste-reoselectivity.[6] Enzymes as Valuable Biocatalysts for Halogenation Turning to nature, the more than 4700 halogenated com-pounds, which have been discovered to date,[7] underline the importance of halogenation in biosynthetic pathways. Notably, in approximately half of these compounds the carbon atom to which the halogen is bound is sp3 hybridized[5] emphasizing that stereocontrolled halogenation must be a critical strategy in natural product synthesis. Today\u2019s known halogenating enzymes are classified accord-ing to their catalytic mechanism. a-Ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases (aKGHs), which are the focus of this Concept paper, harness a radical mechanism, while the other known halogenases either follow an electrophilic or a nucleophilic mechanism. Even though the catalytic cycle of the latter two enzyme families has been extensively reviewed else-where,[3b, 6c, 8] a brief overview of nature\u2019s alternative halogena-tion approaches is helpful to contextualize the unique synthet-ic advantages attainable through the halogenation strategy employed by aKGHs. Heme-iron-dependent[9] and vanadium-containing halogen-ases,[10] which are referred to as haloperoxidases, oxidize a halide anion with the help of hydrogen peroxide and form hy-pohalous acid (HOX) as the halogenation agent.[11] Necessarily, these halogenases follow an electrophilic halogenation mecha-nism and act on electron-rich substrates, like aryl-or alkene moieties. In addition, the HOX is released by the enzyme into the reaction media resulting in the unselective halogenation of the substrate,[11] thus rendering these haloperoxidases unsuit-able for selective chemical transformations. In contrast to halo-peroxidases, flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs), which also generate Cl+ ,[12] Br+ ,[13] or I+ equivalents,[14] are substrate spe-cific and enable regioselective halogenation. The reactive HOX is formed via oxidation of a halide anion by a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin species. However, instead of being released, the HOX is channeled through a 10 a-long tunnel to the sub-strate binding site,[15] where it interacts with an active site lysine presumably either by reaction or via hydrogen bond-ing,[16] enabling selective halogenation of the deeply buried electron-rich substrates. S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent halogenases, the only known enzyme family capable of installing fluoride into a substrate molecule, operate through a nucleophilic mecha-nism. Here, the halide ion attacks the C-5\u2019 carbon atom of SAM in a SN2 substitution reaction in which l-methionine acts as leaving group.[17] This reaction was described for the fluorinase from Streptomyces cattleya,[18] resulting in the corresponding 5\u2019-fluorodeoxy adenosine (5\u2019-FDA), with additional fluorinases catalyzing the same reaction identified in the following [a] M.

Their biological function includes colla-gen biosynthesis, plant and animal development, transcription-al regulation, nucleic acid modification/repair, fatty acid metab-olism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.[21] The transfor-mations catalyzed by aKGDs reflect this diversity and include reactions such as hydroxylation, demethylation, desaturation, epoxidation, epimerization, cyclization, and halogenation.[22] aKGD coordinate FeII in the active site by two conserved histi-dine residues, a carboxylate residue (in halogenases: glycine or alanine) and the cofactor a-ketoglutarate, stabilized in a double-stranded b-helix (DSBH) fold.[23] The radical reaction mechanism of aKGDs involves the formation of a high-valent FeIV=O intermediate, which is formed at the expense of aKG and molecular oxygen. This ferryl intermediate abstracts a hy-drogen from an unactivated C(sp3)@H bond in the primary sub-strate yielding FeIII@OH and the substrate radical, which subse-quently reacts according to the employed enzyme\u2019s reaction specificity (vide infra).[24] Differing from the well-studied hydrox-ylases, halogenases do not contain the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad. Their active site is characterized by the so-called HXG motif, in which the carboxylate residue is replaced by a glycine or alanine allowing space for the coordination of a halide ion. Rebound of the coordinated halide to the substrate radical finally affords the halogenated product (Scheme 2, below).[25] To date, a number of aKGHs have been described: The carri-er protein-dependent halogenases BarB1 and BarB2,[26] SyrB2,[27] CytC3,[28] CmaB,[29] HctB,[30] CurA,[31] and the freestand-ing halogenases WelO5,[32] WelO5*,[33] Wi-WelO15,[34] AmbO5,[35] as well as the recently identified BesD family (Scheme 1).[36] Scheme 1. Substrates (R = H) and products (R = Cl) of Fe/aKG-dependent halogenases with mono-, di-or trihalogenation activities. Only substrates names are The initially discovered carrier protein-dependent halogenases exhibit high specificity for the chlorination of their native sub-strates, like l-threonine (1) for SyrB2[27] and l-alloisoleucine (2) for CmaB,[29] both tethered to their respective carrier protein. The low activity of these enzymes (e.g. , 7 TTN (total turnover number) for SyrB2,[27] see Table 1) and the mandatory covalent tethering of the substrate to the carrier protein has frustrated early attempts to use aKGHs for the biocatalytic C@H function-alization of amino acid type substrates. However, the recent discovery of freestanding aKGHs has rekindled interest in the area of enzymatic C(sp3)-halogenation and has led to the iden-tification[32, 36] and tailoring[34, 37] of aKGHs for academic and in-dustrial applications. Identification of Freestanding aKGHs by Path-way Elucidation Liu and co-workers discovered the first freestanding Fe/aKG-dependent halogenases AmbO5 and WelO5 by pathway eluci-dation leading to indole alkaloids in the cyanobacteria Fischer-ella ambigua UTEX 1903 and Hapalosiphon weltwitschii UTEX B1830, respectively.[38] The authors found strong indication that chlorination occurred at the final steps of the biosynthetic routes because chlorinated and dechlorinated analogs were present at the same time, which led them to infer and verify the presence of a late-stage halogenase. Acquisition of amino acid sequence data permitted the cloning of the genes encod-ing the first freestanding aKGHs. Their subsequent heterolo-gous expression in E. coli allowed for the first time detailed studies to be performed on the biochemical characteristics, catalytic properties and possible applications of the enzymes. Whereas aKGH AmbO5 is able to halogenate the C13 atom of different fischerindole, hapalindole and ambiguine alkaloids (Scheme 1),[35] WelO5 has a more limited substrate scope and preferentially chlorinates the C13 of 12-epi-fischerindole U (10). Notably, WelO5 was the first freestanding aKGH for which a crystal structure was solved.[25] Analyzing the structural features of the enzyme, Liu and co-workers suggested that a distinctive phenomenon in WelO5 is the conformational change under-gone by the external C-terminal a-helix spanning residues 220\u2013235, which shifts 9 a towards the active site upon sub-strate binding. As this a-helix is a highly variable region in AmbO5 and WelO5, it is considered to determine substrate tol-erance and specificity. Substitution of 18 residues in this region or construction of a WelO5-AmbO5 chimera resulted in WelO5 variants with a substrate scope as broad as that of AmbO5.[35] The discovery of WelO5 served as the basis for the identifica-tion and characterization of a further hapalindole alkaloid halo-genase, WelO5* from Hapalosiphon weltwitschii IC-52-3, which shares 95 % protein sequence identity with WelO5 -equivalent to a difference of 15 amino acids.[33] The fact that eleven out of these 15 residues reside on the C-terminal a-helix region most likely explains its enhanced specificity towards 10 compared to WelO5.[33] An additional WelO5 homolog investigated is Wi-WelO15 from Westiella intricata HT-29-1.[34] This halogenase shares 99 % protein sequence identity with WelO5. In 2019, the group of Chang published the discovery and characterization of a freestanding amino acid aKGH named BesD. The enzyme was identified while studying a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of terminal alkyne amino acids in soil bacteria.[40] BesD, an amino acid halogenase involved in the biosynthesis of b-ethynylserine in Streptomyces cattleya,[40] is able to chlorinate l-lysine (5) at the g-carbon (Scheme 1). No-tably, BesD shares low protein sequence identity with other freestanding halogenases such as AmbO5 (25 %) and WelO5 (11 %) but is much closer related to Fe/a-ketoglutarate-depen-dent oxygenases. Based on the crystal structure of BesD in complex with 5, which was later solved by the same group,[36] this halogenase also seems to rely on a covering lid to fix the amino acid substrate in the active site. In addition to the HXG Table 1. Overview of the kinetic parameters of selected native and engineered Fe/aKG-dependent halogenases.[a] motif, the residues His134 and Asn219 were determined to be important for chemoselectivity control through second-sphere interactions with the substrate and the oxo-ligand, respectively. Using BLAST and manual motif identification, potential aKGH sequences were selected and then narrowed down by removal of redundant and shorter sequences, sequence similarity net-work analysis by clustering and evaluation of their genomic contexts (amino acid metabolism). Twenty-one candidates orig-inating mostly, though not only, from Streptomyces and Pseu-domonas were grouped into eight clusters (HalA-H) and func-tionally screened towards a mix of different amino acids. Nine-teen candidates from clusters HalA-G could catalyze the chlori-nation, bromination or azidation of 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 with different regioselectivities (Scheme 1), while two gene products belong-ing to cluster HalH did not exhibit amino acid halogenase ac-tivity.[36] The discoveries of AmbO5, WelO5, and BesD have opened opportunities for further exploration of genes encoding new freestanding Fe/aKG-dependent halogenases. However, al-though important contributions, subsequent studies using known halogenase genes as templates will likely lead to candi-dates with similar substrate scopes. Thus, a possible strategy to source genes encoding novel Fe/aKG-dependent halogen-ase families is through biosynthetic pathway elucidation lead-ing to C(sp3)-halogenated natural products different from ha-palindole or amino acid chemical cores. Methods such as genome mining for natural product discovery or phylogeny-guided mining for identification of new biosynthetic gene clus-ters from microbial genomes or metagenomes have extensive-ly been reviewed and could be applied for this purpose.[41] The process of metabolic gene cluster discovery has become faster owing to the development of powerful bioinformatic tools and the continuously dropping costs of next-generation se-quencing technologies.[42] Last but not least, new halogenases can be obtained by engineering Fe/aKG-dependent hydroxy-lases given the high structural similarity between the two enzyme families.[43] Fe/aKG-Dependent Halogenases as Targets for Protein Engineering To date, halogenase engineering has mainly focused on FDHs[44] or haloperoxidases[45] to halogenate non-natural sub-strates for their use as final products[46] or as intermediates to more valuable aryl-, alkoxy-, or amino compounds.[47] Due to their electrophilic reaction mechanism FDHs and haloperoxi-dases are generally limited to the conversion of aromatic com-pounds, though there are some exceptions, such as the syn-thesis of chloramphenicol[48] or antifungal dichlorinated diapor-thins.[49] Interested to complement this existing biocatalytic halogenation toolbox with enzymes capable of asymmetric halogenation of unactivated C(sp3)-centers, first groups have targeted to engineer Fe/aKG-dependent enzymes for the transformation of non-natural substrates. Creating Halogenases from Hydroxylases Until the discovery of WelO5 in 2014,[38b] the repertoire of Fe/ aKG-dependent halogenases consisted exclusively of carrier protein-dependent enzymes. Therefore, many groups have tried to convert standalone hydroxylases of the Fe/aKG enzyme family into halogenases, with the expectation that these could also perform halogenations without the need of a tethered substrate. The employed strategy focused on remod-eling the metal-coordination motif by replacing Asp or Glu of the HXD/E hydroxylase motif by Gly or Ala in an attempt to mimic the HXG motif of halogenases. This single-site substitu-tion seemed logical as the Asp/Glu carboxylate ligand was known to take the space the halide should occupy for iron co-ordination.[50] Unfortunately, this approach failed when applied to well-characterized Fe/aKG-dependent hydroxylases like taurine di-oxygenase (TauD) and prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4 H).[51] Not only did the resulting variants not behave as halogenases but also lost their hydroxylase activity. Explanations were inefficient iron binding, as determined in TauD variant D101A or insufficient chloride ion binding in the active site, though this was not in-vestigated. In case of P4 H, the affinities of the constructed var-iants D414A/G for iron were never determined, but inefficient iron binding would be expected as wild type P4H has already low affinity for iron.[52] The authors also suggested that hydrox-ylation did not occur due to the lack of a proper hydrogen bonding network conferred by second-sphere residues. Indeed, in the structures of carrier protein-dependent halogen-ases CytC3 and SyrB2 residues that do not make direct contact with the active site iron were revealed to be important to bind a-ketoglutarate and chloride.[50, 53] Reversing the mode of the previous investigations, Drennan and co-workers attempted to turn halogenase SyrB2 into a hy-droxylase by replacing Ala118 with Asp or Glu. However, halo-genase activity was annulled and hydroxylation was not de-tected, even though the enzyme retained its ability to bind iron.[50] Unlike in the SyrB2 example, Boal and co-workers suc-ceeded to convert WelO5 into an exclusive hydroxylase by re-placing Gly with Asp. Crystal structure of variant G166D showed coordination of iron by Asp as found in hydroxy-lases.[25] Besides the requirements of space and electrostatic interac-tions for halide accommodation and coordination, studies on the reactivity of SyrB2 showed that for halogenation to occur the substrate needs to reside distal to the oxygen of the FeIV=O intermediate and therefore spatially distinct from sub-strates targeted for hydroxylation.[43, 54] Substrate positioning far from the oxo moiety and closer to the halide has been pro-posed to be an essential feature favoring the FeIII@Cl rebound (halogenation) over the FeIII@OH rebound (hydroxylation) in carrier protein-dependent halogenases (Figure 1 and Scheme 2). This hypothesis was further confirmed by a sub-strate-extension approach: l-norvaline, a compound which contains an additional methylene group compared to l-threo-nine, was hydroxylated by SyrB2 because its longer side chain brought it closer to the oxo group.[54a] Chem. Eur. J. 2020, 26, 7336 \u2013 7345 www.chemeurj.org T 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim7340 Chemistry\u2014A European Journal Concept doi.org/10.1002/chem.201905752 Notably, the WelO5 structure displays a different substrate positioning than the orientation identified in SyrB2 and the co-crystallized 12-epi-fischerindole U (10) was found surprisingly far from the halide ligand.[25] However, Boal and co-workers suggested that a rearrangement of the active site occurs during the catalytic cycle favored by an unusual a-ketogluta-rate conformation and second sphere hydrogen bonding inter-actions.[25] In BesD, the vacant site for oxygen binding is distal to the substrate, but similar to the proposed WelO5 mecha-nism a substrate conformational change and a shift of the oxo ligand before, during or after aKG decarboxylation has been proposed to occur during catalysis (Figure 1 and Scheme 2).[36] Taking into account the previous structural work, the Boal group utilized the structure of WelO5 in complex with its natu-ral substrate (10) to identify a similar hydroxylase, SadA from Burkholderia ambifaria (PDB ID: 3W21),[55] and tailored it to hal-ogenate one of its natural substrates, N-succinyl-l-leucine (19).[43] Although SadA and WelO5 share only 19 % sequence identity, their active sites possessed high structural homology. As a first step, the Asp in the HXD motif of hydroxylase SadA was replaced by a glycine. In contrast to the preceding investi-gations, variant SadA D157G did halogenate the C3 position of 19 in the presence of NaCl or NaBr with high regioselectivity but low halogenation/hydroxylation ratio. As mutation S189A in WelO5 was previously shown to promote hydroxylation, re-placing the residue in the equivalent position (G179 in SadA) to a serine was expected to suppress hydroxyl transfer. Un-fortunately, SadA D157G/G179S was less active than D157G and chemoselectivity remained unchanged. This suggested that the oxo intermediate was stabilized in a different way in wild type SadA than in WelO5. This remodeling study may cer-tainly serve as a proof of concept that single-site substitution in the HXD motif can be successful provided there is signifi-cant local structural similarity between the subject and the query. However, in absence of more conclusive structural data the (subtle) differences determining hydroxylase versus halo-genase function seem to prevent the elucidation of more gen-eral engineering rules at the moment. Figure 1. Substrate positioning in SyrB2 (PDB ID: 2FCT), WelO5 (PDB ID: 5IQT), and BesD (PDB ID: 6NIE). Given the requirement of a tethered substrate, there Engineering Substrate Specificity, Activity and Reaction Control In the first example of engineering freestanding halogenases for the acceptance of non-indole alkaloid type substrates, Buller and co-workers tailored WelO5* for the regio-and ste-reoselective chlorination of a martinelline-derived fragment (17)[37] with reported anti-cancer activity (Scheme 3).[56] By screening a set of free-standing aKGHs (WelO5, AmbO5, WelO5*, and the engineered SadA D157G[43]), WelO5* was the only enzyme identified to halogenate the target substrate. However, initial activity and chemoselectivity of WelO5* were low, with the major detected product being the hydroxylated side product (1 % conversion towards the chlorinated pro-duct 17 b compared to 40 % towards the hydroxylated prod-uct). In order to increase the activity and chemoselectivity, WelO5* was engineered using a structure-guided evolution ap-proach. Substrate docking studies led to the identification of nine residues (N74, F77, V81, A82, I84, A88, V90, R153 and I161), which were selected as targets for single-site saturation mutagenesis. Libraries of residues A82, A88 and R153 com-prised variants with a 3-to 5-fold increase in halogenation ac-tivity, while libraries on residues V81 and I161 contained mu-tants with 10-to 20-fold increase in activity compared to the wild type. In the screening process, an alternative chlorinated product was observed, highlighting the existence of regiose-lectivity switches in the active site. Based on their different re-gioselectivities, best variants from the first evolution round, CA1 and CB1, were separately subjected to iterative saturation mutagenesis. Second round variant CA2 (V181L/I161M) showed a further 10-fold improvement in chlorination activity and shifted hy-droxylation regioselectivity compared to CA1. A simultaneous 2-site randomization of CB1 afforded second round variant CB2 (V181R/I161S), which almost completely converted 17 to 17 a, reducing hydroxylation to less than 5 %. In vitro, CB2 dis-played more than 290-fold higher TTN and a 400-fold higher apparent turnover towards 17 compared to the wild type enzyme. CB2 was also shown to brominate 17, though it had lower preference for bromide than chloride.[37] In a further study to expand the substrate-scope of free-standing aKGHs, H\u00e7benreich and co-workers recently investi-gated the activities and selectivities of Hw-WelO15 from Hapa-losiphon weltwitschii IC-52-3 (identical to WelO5*) and Wi-WelO15 variants towards five non-natural hapalindole deriva-tives.[34] Through comparison of substrate acceptance by the enzymes, the authors observed that the hapalindole vinyl group was not relevant for substrate recognition whereas the presence of the isonitrile group was important as substrates lacking it were hardly converted. The crystal structure of a Wi-WelO15 variant, named Wi-0 (V6I/D284N), was utilized as a starting point for four rounds of structure-guided directed evo-lution including the identification of hotspots through active site docking of the hapalindole derivative (18). The final puri-fied variants Wi-11 (N47R/V81T/A82M/A88V/V90P/S93L/S103A) and Wi-12 (N47R/A82L/V90P/S93D) were identified as the best in terms of conversion (up to 91 %) and chemoselectivity (96 %) for the conversion of 0.5 mm of 18. Variants from earlier evolution rounds were more efficient towards the other deriva-tives which contained a keto group and indole substitutions. In all cases, chlorination was >99 % regio-and stereoselective for C13 and the (R)-configuration. Particularly, chemoselectivity was impacted by substitution I84H and caused Hw-WelO15 wild type (WelO5*) and Wi-WelO5 variants to shift their prefer-ence towards 30 % hydroxylation of 18, giving further evidence that chemoselectivity is controlled by substrate positioning.[34] These initial engineering studies on WelO5 homologs sug-gest that the reported narrow substrate scope of freestanding aKGHs hinge on few hotspot residues in the active site and thus can be expanded in a straightforward manner using ra-tional design and directed evolution. Furthermore, the achiev-ed optimization of chemoselectivity, turnover number and ap-parent kcat bode well for the expansion of the application scope of halogenases as these improvements demonstrate that the modulation of the enzyme\u2019s performance does not necessarily rely on complex synergistic arrays of functional resi-dues that may limit evolvability. Catalytic Promiscuity Although not an engineering work on a aKGH per se, an enzyme belonging to the family of aKGDs has recently been shown to catalyze non-natural nitrene transfer reactions.[57] This study highlights that selected Fe/aKG-dependent dioxy-genases, in a similar fashion as heme-iron enzymes, are capa-ble of reaction promiscuity under anaerobic conditions.[58] An ethylene-forming dioxygenase from Pseudomonas savastanoi Scheme 3. Examples of non-natural substrates converted by freestanding (PsEFE)\u2014known to naturally hydroxylate l-arginine\u2014catalyzed the intermolecular aziridination of p-toluenesulfonyl azide (20) and styrene to form 21 as well as the intramolecular nitrene C@H bond insertion of 2-ethylbenzenesulfonyl azide (22) to form sultam (23) (Scheme 4). As nitrene transfer would pro-ceed without formation of the reactive iron-oxo intermediate, PsEFE was hypothesized to not require aKG as co-substrate. To prove this, the authors used aKG analogs such as acetate and N-oxalylglycine (NOG), which yielded 7-to 8-fold higher aziridi-nation activity towards 20 compared to reactions carried out with aKG. After two rounds of site-saturation mutagenesis and recombination on five active site residues, a quintuple-mutant, referred to as PsEFE MLHMM, showed a TTN of 120, 15-fold higher than that of the wild type, as well as a significant in-crease in its (R)-selectivity. When the library was screened against 22, the triple-mutant PsEFE VMM stood out with a TTN of 730 and total chemoselectivity for insertion over reduction. Even though these remarkable results were achieved with an atypical member of the aKGD family, this study demonstrates the native capability of Fe/aKG-dependent enzymes to cata-lyze new chemistries. Summary and Outlook Asymmetric C(sp3)-halogenation is a highly desirable transfor-mation for the organic chemist\u2019s toolbox. It is especially valu-able in the context of late-stage functionalization as introduc-ing a halogen early within a synthesis scheme may become a liability to key transformations later on.[5] However, only few synthetic methods exist which allow the selective modification of complex compounds. Turning to nature, the use of Fe/a-ke-toglutarate-dependent halogenases may offer a viable strategy toward the asymmetric halogenation of unactivated C@H bonds. First members of this family acting on freestanding substrates have been discovered and pioneering protein engi-neering studies suggest that the substrate scope of freestand-ing aKGHs can be more easily broadened than anticipated.[34, 37] Nevertheless, the young field has to tackle a range of remain-ing challenges to bring Fe/a-ketoglutarate-dependent halo-genases to their full potential. Most important will be to in-crease the low turnover number of the short-lived aKGHs, which likely suffer from autoxidation. To date, this problem has been primarily addressed by the addition of antioxidants or re-ducing agents in the reaction mixture whereas studies to engi-neer enzyme stability have not yet been conducted. Drawing parallels to pivotal studies carried out, for example, by the groups of Arnold,[59] Flitsch[60] and Turner[61] to improve turn-over numbers of P450s, which also follow a radical mechanism, hopes are high that aKGH performance may be improved in a similar way. Apart from broadening the substrate scope of existing halo-genases by enzyme engineering, the biocatalytic halogenase toolbox would benefit from an influx of new wild type en-zymes accepting a wider range of chemical core structures. Un-fortunately, the identification of novel freestanding Fe/a-keto-glutarate-dependent halogenases has proven challenging, with only a handful of new enzymes identified since their initial dis-covery in 2014. In the context of the current explosion of avail-able genome information, this low success rate is surprising\u2014 however, it can be rationalized when considering the overall low sequence identity of the identified halogenases (e.g. indole alkaloid versus amino acid halogenases). Consequently, learning to reprogram the growing number of diverse Fe/a-ke-toglutarate-dependent hydroxylases[62] to halogenases still rep-resents an attractive avenue forward, even in the light of the limited achievements enzyme engineers have obtained to date. Importantly, the establishment of engineering rules will depend on a more in-depth understanding of which factors determine a hydroxylation versus halogenation reaction out-come. Towards this goal, structural studies of substrate-bound WelO5* and Wi-WelO15 variants on the evolutionary trajectory toward their tailored progeny may shed some light on this aspect of the enzyme\u2019s structure\u2013function relationship as the amount of hydroxylated product produced by the halogenases significantly drops in the course of evolution.[34, 37] Today, Fe/a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases may al-ready be applied for the synthesis of compounds that can be used in structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) studies.[63] Looking forward, the introduction of aKGHs into biosynthetic path-ways, analogously to studies carried out with flavin-dependent halogenases,[47a, 64] may be an attractive tool to increase the di-versity of accessible products and to synthesize bioactive mol-ecules or valuable intermediates. Combined with additional enzyme engineering examples and further mechanistic studies to provide a clearer picture of the catalytic cycle, such applica-tions will turn Fe/a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases into versatile tools for the selective halogenation of traditionally dif-ficult-to-derivatize target substrates.

Since their discovery in 2014, a small number of indole al-kaloid and amino acid halogenases have been identified and characterized. First enzyme engineering examples suggest that the accessible substrate range of these en-zymes may be expanded through the use of rational enzyme design and directed evolution. Structural investi-gations of non-heme iron halogenases acting on free-standing as well as tethered substrates are beginning to inform about the principles of the underlying halogena-tion mechanism.",
        "Introduction",
        "The number of employed biocatalytic steps in industrial pro-cesses is continuously increasing and today enzymes are rou-tinely used to catalyze a variety of chemical transformations, prominent examples including the synthesis of chiral alcohols and amines.[1]",
        "The manufacturing processes benefit from the high regio-and stereoselectivity of the\u2014typically engineered\u2014biocata-lysts, enabling the selective chemical synthesis while reducing associated protection, deprotection, and purification steps.[2] As the discipline of biocatalysis is maturing, scientists turn to improve the technological readiness of intrinsically more com-plex enzyme classes and begin to tap into novel reactivities that go well beyond the current state-of-the-art. Especially C@ H activating enzymes such as halogenases are interesting tar-gets as they are valuable tools for the production of high-value compounds such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemi-cals.[3]",
        "The substitution of a hydrogen with a halogen atom alters a molecule\u2019s properties and affects its pharmacokinetics as well as its biological activity. Unsurprisingly, around 20 % of small molecule drugs and 30 % of agrochemicals are halogenated.[4] In addition, organic halides are useful synthetic handles for functional group transformations and\u2014if installed on aromatic moieties\u2014for the formation of C@C bonds.[5] However, al-though halogenated compounds find wide application in aca-demia and industry, the chemical synthesis of organic halides remains challenging and traditionally require alcohols, alkenes, and acid containing compounds as precursors. Even modern approaches only offer few methods for the functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)@H bonds, which typically place specific de-mands on substrate structure and may suffer from lack of ste-reoselectivity.[6]",
        "Enzymes as Valuable Biocatalysts for Halogenation Turning to nature, the more than 4700 halogenated com-pounds, which have been discovered to date,[7] underline the importance of halogenation in biosynthetic pathways. Notably, in approximately half of these compounds the carbon atom to which the halogen is bound is sp3 hybridized[5] emphasizing that stereocontrolled halogenation must be a critical strategy in natural product synthesis.",
        "Today\u2019s known halogenating enzymes are classified accord-ing to their catalytic mechanism. a-Ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases (aKGHs), which are the focus of this Concept paper, harness a radical mechanism, while the other known halogenases either follow an electrophilic or a nucleophilic mechanism. Even though the catalytic cycle of the latter two enzyme families has been extensively reviewed else-where,[3b, 6c, 8] a brief overview of nature\u2019s alternative halogena-tion approaches is helpful to contextualize the unique synthet-ic advantages attainable through the halogenation strategy employed by aKGHs.",
        "Heme-iron-dependent[9] and vanadium-containing halogen-ases,[10] which are referred to as haloperoxidases, oxidize a halide anion with the help of hydrogen peroxide and form hy-pohalous acid (HOX) as the halogenation agent.[11] Necessarily, these halogenases follow an electrophilic halogenation mecha-nism and act on electron-rich substrates, like aryl-or alkene moieties. In addition, the HOX is released by the enzyme into the reaction media resulting in the unselective halogenation of the substrate,[11] thus rendering these haloperoxidases unsuit-able for selective chemical transformations. In contrast to halo-peroxidases, flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs), which also generate Cl+ ,[12] Br+ ,[13] or I+ equivalents,[14] are substrate spe-cific and enable regioselective halogenation. The reactive HOX is formed via oxidation of a halide anion by a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin species. However, instead of being released, the HOX is channeled through a 10 a-long tunnel to the sub-strate binding site,[15] where it interacts with an active site lysine presumably either by reaction or via hydrogen bond-ing,[16] enabling selective halogenation of the deeply buried electron-rich substrates.",
        "S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent halogenases, the only known enzyme family capable of installing fluoride into a substrate molecule, operate through a nucleophilic mecha-nism. Here, the halide ion attacks the C-5\u2019 carbon atom of SAM in a SN2 substitution reaction in which l-methionine acts as leaving group.[17] This reaction was described for the fluorinase from Streptomyces cattleya,[18] resulting in the corresponding 5\u2019-fluorodeoxy adenosine (5\u2019-FDA), with additional fluorinases catalyzing the same reaction identified in the following",

        "Fe/aKG-Dependent Enzymes Enable Selective C(sp3)-Halogenation The superfamily of a-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases (aKGDs) is diverse with members discovered in bacteria, fungi, plants, and vertebrates. Their biological function includes colla-gen biosynthesis, plant and animal development, transcription-al regulation, nucleic acid modification/repair, fatty acid metab-olism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.[21] The transfor-mations catalyzed by aKGDs reflect this diversity and include reactions such as hydroxylation, demethylation, desaturation, epoxidation, epimerization, cyclization, and halogenation.[22] aKGD coordinate FeII in the active site by two conserved histi-dine residues, a carboxylate residue (in halogenases: glycine or alanine) and the cofactor a-ketoglutarate, stabilized in a double-stranded b-helix (DSBH) fold.[23] The radical reaction mechanism of aKGDs involves the formation of a high-valent FeIV=O intermediate, which is formed at the expense of aKG and molecular oxygen. This ferryl intermediate abstracts a hy-drogen from an unactivated C(sp3)@H bond in the primary sub-strate yielding FeIII@OH and the substrate radical, which subse-quently reacts according to the employed enzyme\u2019s reaction specificity (vide infra).[24] Differing from the well-studied hydrox-ylases, halogenases do not contain the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad. Their active site is characterized by the so-called HXG motif, in which the carboxylate residue is replaced by a glycine or alanine allowing space for the coordination of a halide ion. Rebound of the coordinated halide to the substrate radical finally affords the halogenated product (Scheme 2, below).[25]",
        "To date, a number of aKGHs have been described: The carri-er protein-dependent halogenases BarB1 and BarB2,[26] SyrB2,[27] CytC3,[28] CmaB,[29] HctB,[30] CurA,[31] and the freestand-ing halogenases WelO5,[32] WelO5*,[33] Wi-WelO15,[34] AmbO5,[35] as well as the recently identified BesD family (Scheme 1).[36]",

        "The initially discovered carrier protein-dependent halogenases exhibit high specificity for the chlorination of their native sub-strates, like l-threonine (1) for SyrB2[27] and l-alloisoleucine (2) for CmaB,[29] both tethered to their respective carrier protein. The low activity of these enzymes (e.g. , 7 TTN (total turnover number) for SyrB2,[27] see Table 1) and the mandatory covalent tethering of the substrate to the carrier protein has frustrated early attempts to use aKGHs for the biocatalytic C@H function-alization of amino acid type substrates. However, the recent discovery of freestanding aKGHs has rekindled interest in the area of enzymatic C(sp3)-halogenation and has led to the iden-tification[32, 36] and tailoring[34, 37] of aKGHs for academic and in-dustrial applications.",
        "Identification of Freestanding aKGHs by Path-way Elucidation Liu and co-workers discovered the first freestanding Fe/aKG-dependent halogenases AmbO5 and WelO5 by pathway eluci-dation leading to indole alkaloids in the cyanobacteria Fischer-ella ambigua UTEX 1903 and Hapalosiphon weltwitschii UTEX B1830, respectively.[38] The authors found strong indication that chlorination occurred at the final steps of the biosynthetic routes because chlorinated and dechlorinated analogs were present at the same time, which led them to infer and verify the presence of a late-stage halogenase. Acquisition of amino acid sequence data permitted the cloning of the genes encod-ing the first freestanding aKGHs. Their subsequent heterolo-gous expression in E. coli allowed for the first time detailed studies to be performed on the biochemical characteristics, catalytic properties and possible applications of the enzymes.",
        "Whereas aKGH AmbO5 is able to halogenate the C13 atom of different fischerindole, hapalindole and ambiguine alkaloids (Scheme 1),[35] WelO5 has a more limited substrate scope and preferentially chlorinates the C13 of 12-epi-fischerindole U (10). Notably, WelO5 was the first freestanding aKGH for which a crystal structure was solved.[25] Analyzing the structural features of the enzyme, Liu and co-workers suggested that a distinctive phenomenon in WelO5 is the conformational change under-gone by the external C-terminal a-helix spanning residues 220\u2013235, which shifts 9 a towards the active site upon sub-strate binding. As this a-helix is a highly variable region in AmbO5 and WelO5, it is considered to determine substrate tol-erance and specificity. Substitution of 18 residues in this region or construction of a WelO5-AmbO5 chimera resulted in WelO5 variants with a substrate scope as broad as that of AmbO5.[35]",
        "The discovery of WelO5 served as the basis for the identifica-tion and characterization of a further hapalindole alkaloid halo-genase, WelO5* from Hapalosiphon weltwitschii IC-52-3, which shares 95 % protein sequence identity with WelO5 -equivalent to a difference of 15 amino acids.[33] The fact that eleven out of these 15 residues reside on the C-terminal a-helix region most likely explains its enhanced specificity towards 10 compared to WelO5.[33] An additional WelO5 homolog investigated is Wi-WelO15 from Westiella intricata HT-29-1.[34] This halogenase shares 99 % protein sequence identity with WelO5.",
        "In 2019, the group of Chang published the discovery and characterization of a freestanding amino acid aKGH named BesD. The enzyme was identified while studying a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of terminal alkyne amino acids in soil bacteria.[40] BesD, an amino acid halogenase involved in the biosynthesis of b-ethynylserine in Streptomyces cattleya,[40] is able to chlorinate l-lysine (5) at the g-carbon (Scheme 1). No-tably, BesD shares low protein sequence identity with other freestanding halogenases such as AmbO5 (25 %) and WelO5 (11 %) but is much closer related to Fe/a-ketoglutarate-depen-dent oxygenases. Based on the crystal structure of BesD in complex with 5, which was later solved by the same group,[36] this halogenase also seems to rely on a covering lid to fix the amino acid substrate in the active site. In addition to the HXG",

        "motif, the residues His134 and Asn219 were determined to be important for chemoselectivity control through second-sphere interactions with the substrate and the oxo-ligand, respectively. Using BLAST and manual motif identification, potential aKGH sequences were selected and then narrowed down by removal of redundant and shorter sequences, sequence similarity net-work analysis by clustering and evaluation of their genomic contexts (amino acid metabolism). Twenty-one candidates orig-inating mostly, though not only, from Streptomyces and Pseu-domonas were grouped into eight clusters (HalA-H) and func-tionally screened towards a mix of different amino acids. Nine-teen candidates from clusters HalA-G could catalyze the chlori-nation, bromination or azidation of 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 with different regioselectivities (Scheme 1), while two gene products belong-ing to cluster HalH did not exhibit amino acid halogenase ac-tivity.[36]",
        "The discoveries of AmbO5, WelO5, and BesD have opened opportunities for further exploration of genes encoding new freestanding Fe/aKG-dependent halogenases. However, al-though important contributions, subsequent studies using known halogenase genes as templates will likely lead to candi-dates with similar substrate scopes. Thus, a possible strategy to source genes encoding novel Fe/aKG-dependent halogen-ase families is through biosynthetic pathway elucidation lead-ing to C(sp3)-halogenated natural products different from ha-palindole or amino acid chemical cores. Methods such as genome mining for natural product discovery or phylogeny-guided mining for identification of new biosynthetic gene clus-ters from microbial genomes or metagenomes have extensive-ly been reviewed and could be applied for this purpose.[41] The process of metabolic gene cluster discovery has become faster owing to the development of powerful bioinformatic tools and the continuously dropping costs of next-generation se-quencing technologies.[42] Last but not least, new halogenases can be obtained by engineering Fe/aKG-dependent hydroxy-lases given the high structural similarity between the two enzyme families.[43]",
        "Fe/aKG-Dependent Halogenases as Targets for Protein Engineering To date, halogenase engineering has mainly focused on FDHs[44] or haloperoxidases[45] to halogenate non-natural sub-strates for their use as final products[46] or as intermediates to more valuable aryl-, alkoxy-, or amino compounds.[47] Due to their electrophilic reaction mechanism FDHs and haloperoxi-dases are generally limited to the conversion of aromatic com-pounds, though there are some exceptions, such as the syn-thesis of chloramphenicol[48] or antifungal dichlorinated diapor-thins.[49] Interested to complement this existing biocatalytic halogenation toolbox with enzymes capable of asymmetric halogenation of unactivated C(sp3)-centers, first groups have targeted to engineer Fe/aKG-dependent enzymes for the transformation of non-natural substrates. Creating Halogenases from Hydroxylases",
        "Until the discovery of WelO5 in 2014,[38b] the repertoire of Fe/ aKG-dependent halogenases consisted exclusively of carrier protein-dependent enzymes. Therefore, many groups have tried to convert standalone hydroxylases of the Fe/aKG enzyme family into halogenases, with the expectation that these could also perform halogenations without the need of a tethered substrate. The employed strategy focused on remod-eling the metal-coordination motif by replacing Asp or Glu of the HXD/E hydroxylase motif by Gly or Ala in an attempt to mimic the HXG motif of halogenases. This single-site substitu-tion seemed logical as the Asp/Glu carboxylate ligand was known to take the space the halide should occupy for iron co-ordination.[50]",
        "Unfortunately, this approach failed when applied to well-characterized Fe/aKG-dependent hydroxylases like taurine di-oxygenase (TauD) and prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4 H).[51] Not only did the resulting variants not behave as halogenases but also lost their hydroxylase activity. Explanations were inefficient iron binding, as determined in TauD variant D101A or insufficient chloride ion binding in the active site, though this was not in-vestigated. In case of P4 H, the affinities of the constructed var-iants D414A/G for iron were never determined, but inefficient iron binding would be expected as wild type P4H has already low affinity for iron.[52] The authors also suggested that hydrox-ylation did not occur due to the lack of a proper hydrogen bonding network conferred by second-sphere residues. Indeed, in the structures of carrier protein-dependent halogen-ases CytC3 and SyrB2 residues that do not make direct contact with the active site iron were revealed to be important to bind a-ketoglutarate and chloride.[50, 53]",
        "Reversing the mode of the previous investigations, Drennan and co-workers attempted to turn halogenase SyrB2 into a hy-droxylase by replacing Ala118 with Asp or Glu. However, halo-genase activity was annulled and hydroxylation was not de-tected, even though the enzyme retained its ability to bind iron.[50] Unlike in the SyrB2 example, Boal and co-workers suc-ceeded to convert WelO5 into an exclusive hydroxylase by re-placing Gly with Asp. Crystal structure of variant G166D showed coordination of iron by Asp as found in hydroxy-lases.[25]",
        "Besides the requirements of space and electrostatic interac-tions for halide accommodation and coordination, studies on the reactivity of SyrB2 showed that for halogenation to occur the substrate needs to reside distal to the oxygen of the FeIV=O intermediate and therefore spatially distinct from sub-strates targeted for hydroxylation.[43, 54] Substrate positioning far from the oxo moiety and closer to the halide has been pro-posed to be an essential feature favoring the FeIII@Cl rebound (halogenation) over the FeIII@OH rebound (hydroxylation) in carrier protein-dependent halogenases (Figure 1 and Scheme 2). This hypothesis was further confirmed by a sub-strate-extension approach: l-norvaline, a compound which contains an additional methylene group compared to l-threo-nine, was hydroxylated by SyrB2 because its longer side chain brought it closer to the oxo group.[54a]",

        "Notably, the WelO5 structure displays a different substrate positioning than the orientation identified in SyrB2 and the co-crystallized 12-epi-fischerindole U (10) was found surprisingly far from the halide ligand.[25] However, Boal and co-workers suggested that a rearrangement of the active site occurs during the catalytic cycle favored by an unusual a-ketogluta-rate conformation and second sphere hydrogen bonding inter-actions.[25] In BesD, the vacant site for oxygen binding is distal to the substrate, but similar to the proposed WelO5 mecha-nism a substrate conformational change and a shift of the oxo ligand before, during or after aKG decarboxylation has been proposed to occur during catalysis (Figure 1 and Scheme 2).[36]",
        "Taking into account the previous structural work, the Boal group utilized the structure of WelO5 in complex with its natu-ral substrate (10) to identify a similar hydroxylase, SadA from Burkholderia ambifaria (PDB ID: 3W21),[55] and tailored it to hal-ogenate one of its natural substrates, N-succinyl-l-leucine (19).[43] Although SadA and WelO5 share only 19 % sequence identity, their active sites possessed high structural homology. As a first step, the Asp in the HXD motif of hydroxylase SadA was replaced by a glycine. In contrast to the preceding investi-gations, variant SadA D157G did halogenate the C3 position of 19 in the presence of NaCl or NaBr with high regioselectivity but low halogenation/hydroxylation ratio. As mutation S189A in WelO5 was previously shown to promote hydroxylation, re-placing the residue in the equivalent position (G179 in SadA) to a serine was expected to suppress hydroxyl transfer. Un-fortunately, SadA D157G/G179S was less active than D157G and chemoselectivity remained unchanged. This suggested that the oxo intermediate was stabilized in a different way in wild type SadA than in WelO5. This remodeling study may cer-tainly serve as a proof of concept that single-site substitution in the HXD motif can be successful provided there is signifi-cant local structural similarity between the subject and the query. However, in absence of more conclusive structural data the (subtle) differences determining hydroxylase versus halo-genase function seem to prevent the elucidation of more gen-eral engineering rules at the moment.",

        "screening a set of free-standing aKGHs (WelO5, AmbO5, WelO5*, and the engineered SadA D157G[43]), WelO5* was the only enzyme identified to halogenate the target substrate. However, initial activity and chemoselectivity of WelO5* were low, with the major detected product being the hydroxylated side product (1 % conversion towards the chlorinated pro-duct 17 b compared to 40 % towards the hydroxylated prod-uct). In order to increase the activity and chemoselectivity, WelO5* was engineered using a structure-guided evolution ap-proach. Substrate docking studies led to the identification of nine residues (N74, F77, V81, A82, I84, A88, V90, R153 and I161), which were selected as targets for single-site saturation mutagenesis. Libraries of residues A82, A88 and R153 com-prised variants with a 3-to 5-fold increase in halogenation ac-tivity, while libraries on residues V81 and I161 contained mu-tants with 10-to 20-fold increase in activity compared to the wild type. In the screening process, an alternative chlorinated product was observed, highlighting the existence of regiose-lectivity switches in the active site. Based on their different re-gioselectivities, best variants from the first evolution round, CA1 and CB1, were separately subjected to iterative saturation mutagenesis.",
        "Second round variant CA2 (V181L/I161M) showed a further 10-fold improvement in chlorination activity and shifted hy-droxylation regioselectivity compared to CA1. A simultaneous 2-site randomization of CB1 afforded second round variant CB2 (V181R/I161S), which almost completely converted 17 to 17 a, reducing hydroxylation to less than 5 %. In vitro, CB2 dis-played more than 290-fold higher TTN and a 400-fold higher apparent turnover towards 17 compared to the wild type enzyme. CB2 was also shown to brominate 17, though it had lower preference for bromide than chloride.[37]",
        "In a further study to expand the substrate-scope of free-standing aKGHs, H\u00e7benreich and co-workers recently investi-gated the activities and selectivities of Hw-WelO15 from Hapa-losiphon weltwitschii IC-52-3 (identical to WelO5*) and Wi-WelO15 variants towards five non-natural hapalindole deriva-tives.[34] Through comparison of substrate acceptance by the enzymes, the authors observed that the hapalindole vinyl group was not relevant for substrate recognition whereas the presence of the isonitrile group was important as substrates lacking it were hardly converted. The crystal structure of a Wi-WelO15 variant, named Wi-0 (V6I/D284N), was utilized as a starting point for four rounds of structure-guided directed evo-lution including the identification of hotspots through active site docking of the hapalindole derivative (18). The final puri-fied variants Wi-11 (N47R/V81T/A82M/A88V/V90P/S93L/S103A) and Wi-12 (N47R/A82L/V90P/S93D) were identified as the best in terms of conversion (up to 91 %) and chemoselectivity (96 %) for the conversion of 0.5 mm of 18. Variants from earlier evolution rounds were more efficient towards the other deriva-tives which contained a keto group and indole substitutions. In all cases, chlorination was >99 % regio-and stereoselective for C13 and the (R)-configuration. Particularly, chemoselectivity was impacted by substitution I84H and caused Hw-WelO15 wild type (WelO5*) and Wi-WelO5 variants to shift their prefer-ence towards 30 % hydroxylation of 18, giving further evidence that chemoselectivity is controlled by substrate positioning.[34]",
        "These initial engineering studies on WelO5 homologs sug-gest that the reported narrow substrate scope of freestanding aKGHs hinge on few hotspot residues in the active site and thus can be expanded in a straightforward manner using ra-tional design and directed evolution. Furthermore, the achiev-ed optimization of chemoselectivity, turnover number and ap-parent kcat bode well for the expansion of the application scope of halogenases as these improvements demonstrate that the modulation of the enzyme\u2019s performance does not necessarily rely on complex synergistic arrays of functional resi-dues that may limit evolvability.",

        "Summary and Outlook Asymmetric C(sp3)-halogenation is a highly desirable transfor-mation for the organic chemist\u2019s toolbox. It is especially valu-able in the context of late-stage functionalization as introduc-ing a halogen early within a synthesis scheme may become a liability to key transformations later on.[5] However, only few synthetic methods exist which allow the selective modification of complex compounds. Turning to nature, the use of Fe/a-ke-toglutarate-dependent halogenases may offer a viable strategy toward the asymmetric halogenation of unactivated C@H bonds. First members of this family acting on freestanding substrates have been discovered and pioneering protein engi-neering studies suggest that the substrate scope of freestand-ing aKGHs can be more easily broadened than anticipated.[34, 37] Nevertheless, the young field has to tackle a range of remain-ing challenges to bring Fe/a-ketoglutarate-dependent halo-genases to their full potential. Most important will be to in-crease the low turnover number of the short-lived aKGHs, which likely suffer from autoxidation. To date, this problem has been primarily addressed by the addition of antioxidants or re-ducing agents in the reaction mixture whereas studies to engi-neer enzyme stability have not yet been conducted. Drawing parallels to pivotal studies carried out, for example, by the groups of Arnold,[59] Flitsch[60] and Turner[61] to improve turn-over numbers of P450s, which also follow a radical mechanism, hopes are high that aKGH performance may be improved in a similar way.",
        "Apart from broadening the substrate scope of existing halo-genases by enzyme engineering, the biocatalytic halogenase toolbox would benefit from an influx of new wild type en-zymes accepting a wider range of chemical core structures. Un-fortunately, the identification of novel freestanding Fe/a-keto-glutarate-dependent halogenases has proven challenging, with only a handful of new enzymes identified since their initial dis-covery in 2014. In the context of the current explosion of avail-able genome information, this low success rate is surprising\u2014 however, it can be rationalized when considering the overall low sequence identity of the identified halogenases (e.g. indole alkaloid versus amino acid halogenases). Consequently, learning to reprogram the growing number of diverse Fe/a-ke-toglutarate-dependent hydroxylases[62] to halogenases still rep-resents an attractive avenue forward, even in the light of the limited achievements enzyme engineers have obtained to date. Importantly, the establishment of engineering rules will depend on a more in-depth understanding of which factors determine a hydroxylation versus halogenation reaction out-come. Towards this goal, structural studies of substrate-bound WelO5* and Wi-WelO15 variants on the evolutionary trajectory toward their tailored progeny may shed some light on this aspect of the enzyme\u2019s structure\u2013function relationship as the amount of hydroxylated product produced by the halogenases significantly drops in the course of evolution.[34, 37]",
        "Today, Fe/a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases may al-ready be applied for the synthesis of compounds that can be used in structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) studies.[63] Looking forward, the introduction of aKGHs into biosynthetic path-ways, analogously to studies carried out with flavin-dependent halogenases,[47a, 64] may be an attractive tool to increase the di-versity of accessible products and to synthesize bioactive mol-ecules or valuable intermediates. Combined with additional enzyme engineering examples and further mechanistic studies to provide a clearer picture of the catalytic cycle, such applica-tions will turn Fe/a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases into versatile tools for the selective halogenation of traditionally dif-ficult-to-derivatize target substrates.",
