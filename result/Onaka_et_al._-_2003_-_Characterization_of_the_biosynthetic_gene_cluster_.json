Chemical Structures of Indolocarbazole Compounds in This Study, and of Violacein. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 67 (1), 127\u2013138, 2003 Characterization of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of Rebeccamycin from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243 Hiroyasu ONAKA,\u2020 Shin-ichi TANIGUCHI, Yasuhiro IGARASHI, and Tamotsu FURUMAI Biotechnology Research Center, Toyama Prefectural University, Kosugi, Toyama 939-0398, Japan Received July 29, 2002; Accepted August 19, 2002 The biosynthetic gene cluster for rebeccamycin, an indolocarbazole antibiotic, from Lechevalieria aer-ocolonigenes ATCC 39243 has 11 ORFs. To clarify their functions, mutants with rebG, rebD, rebC, rebP, rebM, rebR, rebH, rebT, or orfD2 disrupted were constructed, and the gene products were examined. rebP disruptants produced 11,11?-dichlorochromopyrrolic acid, found to be a biosynthetic intermediate by a bioconversion ex-periment. Other genes encoded N-glycosyltransferase (rebG ), monooxygenase (rebC ), methyltransferase (rebM ), a transcriptional activator (rebR), and halo-genase (rebH ). rebT disruptants produced rebeccamy-cin as much as the wild strain, so rebT was probably not involved in rebeccamycin production. Biosynthetic genes of staurosporine, an another indolocarbazole an-tibiotic, were cloned from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274. staO, staD, and staP were similar to rebO, rebD, and rebP, respectively, all of which are responsible for indolocarbazole biosynthesis, But a rebC homolog, encoding a putative enzyme oxidizing the C-7 site of pyrrole rings, was not found in the staurosporine biosynthetic gene cluster. These results suggest that in-dolocarbazole is constructed by oxidative decarboxyla-tion of chromopyrrolic acid (11,11?-dichlorochromo-pyrrolic acid in rebeccamycin) generated from two molecules of tryptophan by coupling and that the oxida-tion state at the C-7 position depends on the additional enzyme(s) encoded by the biosynthetic genes. Key words: rebeccamycin; indolocarbazole; biosyn-thetic pathway; Lechevarielia aerocolo-nigenes ATCC 39243; chromopyrrolic acid Rebeccamycin (Fig. 1) is an indolocarbazole alkaloid produced by Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243.* It inhibits DNA topoisomerase I with an IC50 of 1.75 mM in vitro and inhibits the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma cells with a GI50 of 6.0 mgWml in vivo. 1) Indolocarbazole compounds from natural sources have attracted attention be-cause of they are inhibitors of protein kinases or DNA topoisomerases. Staurosporine (Fig. 1), the strongest inhibitor of phospholipid-Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), with an IC50 of 2.7 nM, is frequently used to study cellular proc-esses.2) Protein kinases and DNA topoisomerases are important in cell proliferation, so speci\u02c6c inhibitors are promising candidates for antitumor drugs. In fact, UCN-01,3) BMY-27557,4) and J-1093845) are indolocarbazoles now in clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy. Most indolocarbazole compounds are isolated from actinomycetes: rebeccamycin is from Leche-valieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243, staurosporine 128 H. ONAKA et al. is from L. aerocolonigenes subsp. staurosporeus and Streptomyces sp. strain TP-A0274, K252a is from Nocardiopsis sp. strain K2526) and J-104303 is from Streptomyces mobaraensis BA 13793.7) Biosynthetic studies done with isotope-labeled precursors indicat-ed that the indolocarbazole structure is derived from two molecules of tryptophan, probably via in-dolepyruvic acid as an intermediate.8\u201310) Ohuchi et al. reported cloning of the ngt gene encoding an N-glycosyltransferase from L. aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243.5) The Ngt protein converted an indolocarba-zole, J-104303, to its N-glucoside, indicating that ngt is responsible for N-glycosylation in rebeccamycin biosynthesis. Very recently, in a \u02c6rst report about in-dolocarbazole antibiotics, Sanchez et al. cloned the rebeccamycin biosynthetic genes, using an internal fragment of ngt as a probe.11) Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 25.6-kb fragment of the L. aero-colonigenes ATCC 39243 genome found 18 open reading frames (ORFs). On the basis of sequence analysis and database searches, they proposed four genes for indolocarbazole biosynthesis (rebO, rebD, rebC, and rebP ), two genes for halogenation (rebH, and rebF ), glycosylation (rebG, the name was changed from ngt ), and sugar methylation (rebM ), as well as a regulatory gene (rebR) and two resistance and secretion genes (rebU and rebT ). Heterologous gene expression of the set rebO, rebD, rebC, and rebP for indolocarbazole biosynthesis resulted in production of deschlororebeccamycin aglycone. We have been independently investigating the bio-synthetic genes for rebeccamycin,12) and discovered its biosynthetic pathway with the identi\u02c6cation of several key biosynthetic intermediates. We here characterize the biosynthetic gene cluster for rebec-camycin using a newly developed host-vector system for the genus Lechevalieria and gene-disruption ex-periments. The structures of the accumulated products of each reb disruptant were identi\u02c6ed and an overall biosynthetic pathway of rebeccamycin is proposed. Materials and Methods Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth condition. L. aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and used as the source of DNA in the construction of the genom-ic libraries. Streptomyces sp. strain TP-A0274 was newly isolated from soil collected in Kosugi-machi, Toyama, Japan. Escherichia coli DH-5a served as the host for plasmid subcloning in pUC19 and pK18mob.13) E. coli XL1-Blue MR was used for clon-ing of the pK40214) and the pTOYAMAcos cosmid (Onaka, in preparation). E. coli S17-1 was used for transconjugation.15) Growth conditions and manipu-lations of E. coli were as described by Sambrook and Russell.16) The production medium for L. aero-colonigenes was medium G134.1) The seed culture for L. aerocolonigenes was in V-22 medium.17) Bennett's glucose agar,17) nutrient broth agar, and mannitol soya \u2030our agar18) were used for conjugational trans-formation. General recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Taq polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. DNA frag-ments were labelled with [a-32P]-dCTP (6000 Ci mmol\u201e1; Amersham) and the BcaBEST labelling kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.). PCR was carried out with the PTC-200 DNA Engine (MJ Research, MA, USA). DNA manipulations were as described by Sambrook and Russell.16) Cloning of the rebeccamycin biosynthetic genes. The two PCR primers, 5?-TCGGAATTCATGG-GGGCACGAGTGCTG-3? (NGT1) and 5?-AGGA-AGCTTGAACGGGCCGACGAACCT-3? (NGT2), were synthesized on the basis of the ngt DNA sequence recorded as accession No. AB023953 in GenBank. Underlining letters indicate EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites for cloning to vec-tors. A 731-bp DNA fragment was ampli\u02c6ed by PCR with each of the PCR primers and L. aerocolonigenes chromosomal DNA. The ampli\u02c6ed products were radiolabelled by the random priming method and put through colony hybridization. For the construction of a genomic library, chromosomal DNA of L. aerocolonigenes was prepared as described by Kieser et al.18) and partially digested with Sau3AI, and DNA fragments of \u00c030 kb were puri\u02c6ed by gel electropho-resis. The puri\u02c6ed DNA fragments were ligated with pKU402 and packaged into l phage. A hybridized cosmid, pREBC5, was digested with BamHI and the hybridizing 8-kb fragment was subcloned into pUC19 to give pREB1. 3.4-kb BamHI, 2.9-kb BamHI, 2.7-kb SphI, 2-kb PstI, and 2.3-kb XhoI fragments, which were upstream from of the 8-kb fragment, also were cloned into pUC19 to give pREB5, pREB7, pREB9, pREB10, and pREB11, (see Fig. 2(A)). Construction of plasmids for gene inactivation. (i) pDrebG. pDrebG was constructed by the cloning of a 776-bp PmaCI-SphI fragment prepared from pREB1, which contained an internal region of the rebG gene, into the SmaI-SphI sites of pK18mob. (ii) pDrebD, pDrebP, pDrebM, pDrebH, pDrebT, and pDorfD2. A 543-bp fragment was ampli\u02c6ed by PCR with primers designed on the basis of the internal region of the rebD and pREB1 as the template. The fragment was inserted into pK18mob to give pDrebD. Five plasmids, pDrebP, pDrebM, pDrebH, pDrebT, and pDorfD2, which contained internal regions of rebP, rebM, rebH, rebT, and orfD2 as shown in Fig. 2(A), also were constructed by the 129 Fig. 2.

Biosynthetic Pathway of Rebeccamycin same method as that for pDrebD with pREB5 (pDrebP, pDrebM), pREB1 (pDorfD2), pREB10 (pDrebH), or pREB11 (pDrebT) as the templates for PCR. The primer sequences are as follows: rebD-N; 5?-GAAGAATTCGTGATGCTGCAGTACCTGTA-3?, rebD-C; 5?-CGAAAGCTTCAGGAACAGGTG-GTGCTCGCC-3?, rebP-N; 5?-CCGAAGCTTCAC-ACGGCGCTGAGATCGTTG-3?, rebP-C; 5?-GTC GAATTCCGCCCAGCGAGTGACCATCTGCAC-3?, rebM-N; 5?-ACGAAGCTTTCGGCTTGGCG-AACATCGGAC-3?, rebM-C; 5?-CGGGAATTCG-ACGTCGGCTGCGGGATCGGC-3?, rebH-N; 5?-AGCGAATTCCGCTGTCGCACTACTGGTTCG-3?, rebH-C; 5?-GTCAAGCTTCTCCTGCATGC-CGTCCGCCAG-3?, rebT-N; 5?-CGGGAATTC CCTGTTCGGTGCCGCCTCCCT-3?, rebT-C; 5?-CCGAAGCTTTCTCCGCGAGTCCCGCGACGG-3?, orfD2-N; 5?-CACGAATTCCGAGGAGGTTC-GCGAGAAGGTGGG-3?, orfD2-C; 5?-GAAAAG-CTTGAAGCCGTCGGGATAGCGGTGGTG-3?, in which EcoRI or HindIII sites (underlining letters in-dicated) were created for facilitation of the cloning. (iii) pDrebC and pDrebR. For in-frame deletion of the rebC, a 3.0-kb SphI fragment was prepared from pREB1 and cloned into the SphI site of pUC19 to generate pREB1A. The plasmid was digested with NcoI and the resulting rebC-truncated large fragment was puri\u02c6ed and self-ligated to give pREB1B. A 2.9-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment was prepared from pREB5 and subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pREB1B to construct pREB1C. A 5-kb EcoRI-Hin-dIII fragment was prepared from pREB1C and cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII site of pK18mob to construct pDrebC. For in-frame deletion of rebR, a 2.2-kb SphI fragment was prepared from pREB7 and cloned into the SphI site of pK18mob to generate pREB7A. A 2.3-kb Pst I fragment (one of the Pst I sites is on a multiple cloning site of pUC19) was pre-pared from pREB5 and subcloned into the Pst I site of pREB7A to construct pDrebR. Both of the dele-tion regions are shown in Fig. 2(A). Gene disruption and transformation in Leche-valieria aerocolonigenes. For disruption of the chro-mosomal genes, we used the method of insertional inactivation via a single crossover with the non-replicating E. coli plasmid, pK18mob, derivatives (pDrebG, pDrebD, pDrebP, pDrebM, pDrebH, pDrebT, and pDorfD2) or via a double crossover with pDrebC and pDrebR. rebG and rebC double disruptants were constructed from the rebC-truncat-ed mutant strain to use the method via a single cros-sover with pDrebG. The method of transconjugation is modi\u02c6ed from the method for Streptomyces spe-cies as described by Mazodier et al.15) After transcon-jugation, 3 ml of 0.5z nutrient broth agar (Difco) with 200 mgWml kanamycin was overlaid on a man-nitol soya \u2030our agar plate for transformant selection 130 H. ONAKA et al. and the selected colonies were transferred to a Ben-nett's glucose agar plate containing 5 mgWml nalidixic acid and 20 mgWml kanamycin. The chromosomal DNAs were prepared from the candidate transfor-mants and the restriction map of the chromosomal DNA was checked by Southern hybridization. For disruption of the chromosomal genes with pDrebC and pDrebR, \u02c6rst crossover events were done with the same method as for single crossover disruption. The pDrebC-or pDrebR-integrated strains were cultivated in a 500-ml K-1 \u2030ask containing 100 ml of V-22 medium with no antibiotics. After two rounds of cultivation, we selected colonies that were kanamycin-sensitive to obtain in-frame deletion mutants. The genomic structure of the strains ob-tained was checked by Southern hybridization. HPLC of the products from gene-disrupted mutants. HPLC was done on a HP1090 system with a diode array detector (Hewlett Packard) and a C18 Rainin Microsorb column (3 mm, 100\u00d74.6 mm, i.d.; Rainin Instrument Co., MA, USA). Acetonitrile-0.15z KH2PO4 was the elution bu\u0160er. The tempera-ture was 409C, the \u2030ow rate was 1.2 mlWmin, the sol-vent was acetonitrile-0.15z KH2PO4 (pH 3.5), and detection was at 254 nm. (the gradient diagram is in Fig. 4(A)) Each of the disrupted mutants was used to inoculate a 500-ml K-1 \u2030ask containing 100 ml of V-22 medium. After incubation at 309C for 2 days on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm, 5-ml portions of the seed culture were transferred into 500-ml K-1 \u2030asks con-taining 100 ml of medium G134. Fermentation was at 309C for 11 days on the same rotary shaker. The cul-ture broth was centrifuged to collect a mycelial cake, which was extracted with 100 ml of acetone. After the acetone was evaporated o\u0160, the resultant solution was extracted with 100 ml of ethyl acetate three times, concentrated under reduced pressure, and dis-solved in Me2SO for HPLC. The supernatant of the culture broth also was checked for production of re-beccamycin or its related compounds. Puri\u02c6cation of rebeccamycin intermediates. To purify the rebeccamycin aglycon (5), L. aer-ocolonigenes rebG ::kmr was used to inoculate 500-ml K-1 \u2030asks containing 100 ml of V-22 medium. After cultivation at 309C for 2 days on a rotary shak-er, 5-ml portions of the seed culture were transferred into \u02c6fty 500-ml K-1 \u2030asks, each containing 100 ml of medium G134. The culture broth (5 liters) was cen-trifuged at 5000\u00d7g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the mycelial cake was extracted with 5 liters of acetone. After the evaporation, the resultant aqueous solution was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate two times and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 1.2 g of crude extract. The residue was dissolved in 2.5 ml of methanol and put on an ODS-AM reverse-phase silica gel column (4.6 i.d.\u00d720 cm; YMC) equilibrated with 20z aqueous methanol. The column was eluted with 50z aqueous methanol and then 100z methanol. The rebeccamycin aglycon eluted in the 100z methanol fraction. The fractions containing the rebeccamycin aglycon were pooled, and evaporated under reduced pressure to give pure rebeccamycin aglycon (61.2 mg). For puri\u02c6cation of 4 (11,11?-dichloro-chromopyrrolic acid), 10 (4?-O-demethylrebeccamy-cin), 8 (7-deoxo-7-hydroxyrebeccamycin aglycon), 9 (7-deoxorebeccamycin aglycon), and 11 (1,11-dechloro-4?-O-demethylrebeccamycin), strain rebD::kmr (4), strain rebM ::kmr (10), strain DrebC+rebG ::kmr (8, 9), or strain rebH ::kmr (11) was used and the puri\u02c6cation method was the same as for rebeccamycin aglycon except that the materials eluted in the 50z methanol fraction from the ODS-AM column. Further HPLC was done of the products from strain DrebC+rebG ::kmr (8, 9) and strain rebH ::kmr (11) to obtain purity high enough for NMR. HPLC puri\u02c6cation was done on a Shimadzu HPLC system (SPD-M10A) with a diode array detector (LC10-AT, Shimadzu) and an XTerra RP18 column (19 i.d.\u00d7300 mm; Waters). Partially puri\u02c6ed samples containing the intermediates were dissolved in methanol and put on an HPLC column. The temperature was 309C, \u2030ow rate 15 mlWmin, sol-vent 50z acetonitrile-0.15z KH2PO4 (pH 3.5). Each intermediate was fractionated on the basis of the in-formation from the diode array detector, with detec-tion at 254 nm. Analysis of metabolites. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured at 400 and 100 MHz in Me2SO-d6 on a JNM-LA400 apparatus (JEOL). LC-MS spectra were obtained on an API165 machine (Applied Biosystems). UV-visible spectra were taken on a HP1090 system. NMR data for compounds 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are shown in Tables 1 to 3. MS data are as follows. Compound 4: ESI-MS [M+H]+: mWz\uff1d 454.2, [M\u201eH]\u201e: mWz 452.2. Compound 5: ESI-MS [M\u201eH]\u201e: mWz 392.0. Compound 8: ESI-MS [M+H]+: mWz 396.2. Compound 9: ESI-MS [M+H]+: mWz 380.2. Compound 10: ESI-MS [M+H]+: mWz 556.0, [M\u201eH] \u201e: mWz 554.0. Com-pound 11: ESI-MS [M+H]+: mWz 488.6, [M\u201eH] \u201e: mWz 486.0. Bioconversion experiments. Two hundred mg of a putative puri\u02c6ed intermediate was added to a tube containing 10 ml of medium G134 and already cul-tured L. aerocolonigenes rebH ::kmr was used to in-oculate the same tube. After cultivation at 309C for 5 days and 7 days on a rotary shaker, 5-ml portions were extracted. HPLC conditions and sample prepa-ration were as described in the section on HPLC of the products from gene-disrupted mutants. The re-beccamycin production was identi\u02c6ed with the reten-131Biosynthetic Pathway of Rebeccamycin tion time by HPLC and from the UV-visible spec-trum. Cloning and sequencing of the staurosporine biosynthetic genes. The staD gene fragment was ampli\u02c6ed from Streptomyces sp. strain TP-A0274 genomic DNA with the primers rebBN and rebBC, designed on the basis of the rebD and vioB sequence, and was used as a colony hybridization probe. The sequences of primers were (rebBN) 5?-GCCAA-GCTTATCTGGCAGATGTGCGACCCG-3? and (rebBC) 5?-CAGGAATTCGATCATCTCCTCGC-GGGCGA-3?, in which EcoRI or HindIII sites (un-derlining letters indicated) were created for facilita-tion of the cloning. PCR was done at 989C for 20 sec, 609C for 30 sec, and 729C for 1 min, for 30 cycles. A 426-bp ampli\u02c6ed fragment was radiolabelled by the random priming method and used for hybridization. For the construction of a genomic library, chro-mosomal DNA of Streptomyces sp. strain TP-A0274 was partially digested with Sau3AI, and DNA frag-ments of \u00c030 kb were puri\u02c6ed by gel electrophoresis. The resulting DNA fragments were ligated with BamHI-digested pTOYAMAcos, which is an ac-tinomycetes\u2014E. coli shuttle cosmid vector, and packaged into l phage. Five hybridized cosmids were isolated. A selected cosmid was designated pTYMCsta and digested with BamHI, and the hybridizing 5.6-kb fragment was subcloned into pUC19 to give pSTA1. Two-kilobase and 2.3-kb BamHI fragments, which were in the upstream and downstream regions of the 5.6-kb fragment, respec-tively, also were cloned into pUC19 to give pSTA2 and pSTA3, as shown in Fig. 2(B). These fragments were sequenced with an ABI PRISM cycle sequenc-ing kit and analyzed on a ABI PRISM 310 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The templates for DNA sequencing were prepared with the Locus Pocus transposon insertion system kit (Novagen). The DNA and protein sequence similarity searches were done with the BLAST server at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD). Nucleotide sequence accession number. The nucleotide sequence for the rebeccamycin biosynthet-ic genes has been deposited in the DDBJ database under DDBJ Accession Number AB071405 and that for the staurosporine biosynthetic genes has been deposited under DDBJ Accession Number AB071406. Results and Discussion Construction of disrupted mutants for biosynthe-sis The conventional transformation protocol involv-ing protoplasting and regeneration of mycelia usually used for Streptomyces strains could not be used for L. aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243. We therefore de-veloped a protocol for conjugational transfer from E. coli to strain ATCC 39243 by modifying the Strep-tomyces method.15) A plasmid, pK18mob, carrying the ColE1 replicon and an origin essential for con-jugal transfer was used. Chromosomal DNAs were prepared from transformants that grew well on the selection plates, and chromosomal recombination events was monitored by Southern hybridization (Figs. 3(C) and 3(D)). Except for rebC and rebR dis-ruptants, insertional inactivation via a single cros-sover was con\u02c6rmed (Fig. 3(A)). rebC and rebR were disrupted by in-frame deletion (Fig. 3(B)) because insertional inactivation of rebC or rebR probably would have a polar e\u0160ect on the transcription of genes downstream form rebC or rebR (Fig. 2(A)). Double disruptants of rebC and rebG were construct-ed from an in-frame rebC deletion mutant by a single crossover in the rebG region. Finally, three mutants were independently isolated and further analyzed for each of the following: rebG, rebD, rebC, rebC+rebG, rebP, rebR, rebH, rebT, and orfD2 dis-ruptants. Two mutants were isolated from rebM dis-ruptants and analyzed. Characterization of rebeccamycin biosynthetic genes The rebG, rebD, rebC, rebP, rebM, rebR, and rebH genes were con\u02c6rmed to constitute the rebec-camycin biosynthetic gene cluster by gene disruption experiments. Although the cloning and expression of rebG was previously described,5) it was not proved there that rebG is involved in rebeccamycin biosyn-thesis. We constructed a rebG mutant by gene disrup-tion and found that it produced the rebeccamycin aglycon but not rebeccamycin (Fig. 4(B)). The rebG product therefore was the N-glycosyltransferase responsible for rebeccamycin biosynthesis. rebD encoded a protein of 1,013 amino acid residue. A BLAST search indicated 36.6z identity over the entire sequence of RebD to VioB, which is involved in violacein (Fig. 1) biosynthesis in Chromobacterium violaceum and catalyzes a con-densation reaction of 5-hydroxytryptophan and in-dolepyruvic acid to generate the bisindole intermedi-ate for violacein.19) The rebD-disrupted mutant did not produce compounds related to indolocarbazoles (Fig. 4(C)); in the same way, the vioB disruptant does not produce any violacein related metabolites.19) rebO, rebD, rebC, and rebP seemed to be transla-tionally coupled, suggesting that at least these four genes might be transcribed polycistronically. Strain rebD::kmr might have polar e\u0160ects on the expression of rebC and rebP, but we could ignore such e\u0160ects in this experiment because rebC and rebP products were involved in later biosynthetic steps than the rebD product, as described in the following paragraph 132 Fig. 3.

(C) Southern blotting of L. aerocolonigenes wild type (W) and a disruptant of rebG, rebD, rebP, rebC+rebG, rebM, rebH, rebT, or orfD2. The chromosomal DNAs were digested with XhoI (rebG and rebH ), Sal I (rebC+rebG and rebD ), BamHI (orfD2, rebP, rebT, and rebM ). The 0.78-kb internal rebG fragment from pDrebG, 0.54-kb rebD fragment from pDrebD, 0.61-kb rebP frag-ment from pDrebP, 0.42-kb rebM fragment from pDrebM, 0.42-kb rebH fragment from pDrebH, 0.92-kb rebT fragment from pDrebT, and 0.57-kb orfD2 fragment from pDorfD2 were used as 32P-labelled probes. (D) Southern blotting of a disruptant of rebC or rebR. The chromosomal DNAs were digested with SacI (rebC ) and PvuII (rebR). The 0.54-kb rebD fragment from pDrebD and 2.2-kb SphI fragment from pREB7 were used as rebC and rebR probes, respectively. Lanes 1 and 2 indicate pDrebC-and pDrebR-integrated strains. H. ONAKA et al. about results of the analysis of rebP and rebC dis-ruptants. Considering the structural similarities of violacein and rebeccamycin, both of which are der-ived from two molecules of tryptophan, this observa-tion led us to propose that RebD is involved in the construction of the bisindole structure by catalyzing a coupling reaction between 7-chlorotryptophan and 7-chloroindole-3-pyruvic acid. The rebP gene product is quite similar to a cytochrome-P-450-like enzyme. The major product that the rebP disruptant accumulated was 11,11?-dichlorochromopyrrolic acid (CCA, 4) (Fig. 4(D)). The structure of CCA was identi\u02c6ed from NMR and MS spectra. A 13C NMR spectrum showed 11 sp2 car-bons, suggesting that CCA was a symmetrical molec-ule and that all of the carbons in tryptophan were retained in CCA. 1H-13C long-range couplings ob-served in the HMBC spectrum con\u02c6rmed the chlo-roindole moiety (Fig. 5(A)). The presence of a pyr-role ring was not directly con\u02c6rmed by HMBC, but the structure of CCA was deduced to be the chlori-nated analog of chromopyrrolic acid20) by the LC-MS, which gave a molecular ion [M+H]+ at mWz 454.2, and by comparison of NMR results with those reported for chromopyrrolic acid. Chromopyrrolic acid [3,4-di-(3-indolyl)-pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid] is a secondary metabolite found in C. violaceum, a producer of violacein.20) The close similarity of vioB and rebD suggested that CCA was biosynthesized di-rectly by RebD. Conversion of CCA to indolocarba-133 Fig. 4. HPLC Chromatograph and UV-Vis Spectrum of Products of Wild Type and Gene Disruptant Mutants. HPLC conditions and sample preparation were described in the text. The elution was done with a linear gradient as indicated on the right-hand scale in A. Biosynthetic Pathway of Rebeccamycin zole through oxidative decarboxylation is generally thought to be catalyzed by RebP. In a check of our proposal, a bioconversion experiment was done (Fig. 6). CCA was added to the culture broth of the rebH disruptant and the products were analyzed by HPLC after 5 and 7 days. The peak of CCA (9.9 min) disappeared and the production of rebeccamycin (13.3 min) was detected after 7 days (Fig. 6(B)). Because the rebH disruptant was unable to produce chlorinated indolocarbazoles, including rebeccamycin, we concluded that CCA was convert-ed to rebeccamycin as a biosynthetic intermediate. The rebC gene product was similar to a \u2030avin bind-ing site containing monooxygenase.

The UV-visible spectrum showed that products 6 and 7 contained the in-dolocarbazole chromophore. This result indicates that indolocarbazole could be constructed without the involvement of the rebC product. The com-pounds of 6 and 7 were found to be 7-deoxo-7-hydroxyrebeccamycin and its 4?-O-demethyl deriva-tive, on the basis of the following observations: in 135 Fig. 5. HMBC Correlations with Metabolites from Gene-disrupted Mutants. Fig. 6. HPLC of Products of a rebH-Disruptant Grown in Medi-um with CCA. The whole broth of 5-days (A) and 7-days (B) cultures were prepared as HPLC samples. The peaks of 9.9 and 13 min cor-respond to CCA and rebeccamycin, respectively. Biosynthetic Pathway of Rebeccamycin LC-MS, the peaks at 7.7 (6) and 9 (7) min showed the molecular ion [M+H]+ at mWz 572 and 558, two units higher than that of rebeccamycin (mWz 570) and 4?-O-demethylrebeccamycin (mWz 556), respectively; NMR results showed that each peak consisted of a mixture of 12-N-and 13-N-glycosides not separable on HPLC (NMR results not shown). Taken together, with the function of RebC assumed from the se-quence similarity, the structures of 6 and 7 were deduced to be 7-deoxo-7-hydroxyrebeccamycin and its 4?-O-demethyl derivative, although it is not clear whether the glycosylation site was at the 12-or 13-nitrogen. The rebG disruption experiment showed that N-glycosylation happened after indolocarbazole formation. We concluded that these two glycosylated products are shunt products. We then constructed rebG and rebC double disruptants to eliminate the glycosylated products, and analyzed the fermented products. Three peaks were detected in HPLC of the culture broth (Fig. 4(F), peaks 5, 8, and 9), and they were identi\u02c6ed as rebeccamycin aglycon (5), 7-deoxo-7-hydroxyrebeccamycin aglycon (8), and 7-deoxore-beccamycin aglycon (9), respectively, by NMR. NMR assignments and HMBC results for 5, 8, and 9 are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and in Figs. 5(B)\u20135(D). NMR results for these compounds showed similarity to reported values.21,22) Bioconversion experiments with 8 or 9 as an added sample were done to con\u02c6rm which was the real intermediate, but neither com-pound was converted to rebeccamycin. Presumably, in the rebC disruptants, the other oxidase enzymes recognize the real intermediate of rebC disruptants as a substrate and produce 8 and 9. The RebC products were not con\u02c6rmed in these disruption experiments, although, considering that rebeccamycin aglycon was identi\u02c6ed as one of the products, we suppose that RebP took part in the conversion from CCA to re-beccamycin aglycone and that RebC controlled the oxidation state at the C-7 site. The rebM product was similar to methyltran-sferases from various organisms. The rebM dis-ruptant accumulated compound 10 (Fig. 4(G)), 136 H. ONAKA et al. which was identi\u02c6ed as 4?-O-demethylrebeccamy-cin23) by NMR (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 5(E)) and LC-MS, which gave a [M+H]+ ion at mWz 556.0. There-fore, rebM encoded the methyltransferase responsi-ble for methylation at the 4-hydroxy group of the glucose moiety. Additionally, 4?-O-demethylrebec-camycin was converted to rebeccamycin by an rebH disruptant (not shown), which con\u02c6rmed that the methylation was the last step of the biosynthesis. The rebH gene product was similar to the trypto-phan halogenase from Pseudomonas chlororaphis, which enzyme catalyzes the chlorination reaction from L-tryptophan to 7-chloro-L-tryptophan in pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis.24) The rebH disruptant produced an indolocarbazole compound, 11, corresponding to the peak at 7.9 min on HPLC (Fig. 4(H)). The mass spectrum showed [M+H]+ at mWz 487 and NMR con\u02c6rmed compound 11 to be 1,11-dechloro-4?-O-demethylrebeccamycin. The NMR results for 11 were in accordance with those reported earlier.11) We concluded that RebH is responsible for chlorination of the indole moiety. Taking into account the similarity to the tryptophan halogenase from P. chlororaphis, chlorination probably takes place with tryptophan at the begin-ning of the biosynthetic cascade. The production of 1,11-dechloro-4?-O-demethylrebeccamycin might be allowed by substrate recognition by RebO, RebD, RebC, RebP, and RebG. Regulatory and other genes A database search found that RebR was similar to an luxR family transcriptional regulator. In our experiment, the rebR-truncated mutant did not produce compounds related to rebeccamycin (Fig. 4(I)). Sanchez et al. reported that rebR is essen-tial for production in the heterologous expression of indolocarbazole biosynthesis genes.11) These \u02c6ndings indicate that RebR is a pathway-speci\u02c6c activator for rebeccamycin production. rebT was at the end of the rebeccamycin biosyn-thetic gene cluster and was similar to transmembrane e\u0152ux proteins, which are candidates for rebeccamy-cin resistance or secretion. Disruption of rebT did not decrease the production level: the wild type produced rebeccamycin at the concentration of 52.5\u00b17 mgWl in 9 days of culture, and the rebT disruptants produced it at the concentration of 52.6\u00b11 mgWl. Sanchez et al. reported that rebT in-troduced into Streptomyces albus confers resistance to rebeccamycin.11) RebT might protect cells from the in\u2030ux of an excess of rebeccamycin. We concluded that rebT is not involved in the rebeccamycin produc-tion in L. aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243. orfD2 was immediately downstream of rebG with the reverse orientation on the chromosomal DNA. The orfD2-disrupted mutants produced as much rebeccamycin as the wild type strain did (Fig. 4(J)), indicating that orfD2 was not related to rebeccamy-cin biosynthesis and that the rebG gene was at the end of the rebeccamycin biosynthetic cluster. Similarities and di\u0160erences in indolocarbazole biosynthetic genes between rebeccamycin and staurosporine The staurosporine-producing strain Streptomyces sp. strain TP-A0274 was newly isolated from a soil sample collected in Toyama, Japan, and the stauro-sporine biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned on the basis of information from the rebD nucleotide se-quence. The genomic library of strain TP-A0274 was constructed and the biosynthesis gene was screened for with colony hybridization. The selected cosmid, pTYMCsta, was con\u02c6rmed to include the entire staurosporine biosynthetic genes by heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans TK23.25) The gene organization map of rebD homolog loci is shown in Fig. 2(B). A comparison between the amino acid sequences encoded by staG and rebG from L. aer-ocolonigenes found 55.8z identity, suggesting that staG encoded an N-glycosyltransferase. Upstream from staG, there were three ORFs, staO, staD, and staP, and the deduced amino acid sequences were similar to rebO (53.2z identity, 80.3z similarity), rebD (55.2z identity, 77.4z similarity), and rebP (51.8z identity, 79.8z similarity), respectively, sug-gesting that these ORFs encoded indolocarbazole biosynthesis genes. There was no gene similar to rebC in the staurosporine biosynthetic genes in strain TP-A0274. The di\u0160erences in the structures of staurospo-rine and rebeccamycin aglycon were the presence or absence of a carbonyl group at C-7. rebC-disrupted mutants produced 7-deoxo-rebeccamycin, so RebC seemed to catalyze the oxidation at the C-7-position to the carbonyl group. Proposed overall biosynthetic pathway of rebec-camycin The most striking \u02c6nding in this study was the identi\u02c6cation of CCA as a biosynthetic intermediate: decarboxylation occurs after the coupling of two tryptophan-molecules derivative. On the basis of our results, the biosynthetic pathway for rebeccamycin shown in Fig. 7 is proposed. The initial step is the chlorination of tryptophan by the putative halo-genase RebH. The produced 7-chlorotryptophan (13) is oxidatively deaminated by RebO to give 7-chlo-roindole-3-pyruvic acid (14). The rebO gene product has 25.3z identity in its 473 amino acid sequence to the L-amino acid oxidase from Crotalus adamanteus (eastern diamondback rattlesnake),26) which is a com-ponent of snake poison and catalyzes an oxidization reaction of L-tryptophan to indole-3-pyruvic acid. Therefore RebO may be responsible for the deamina-tion of 7-chlorotryptophan. 7-Chloroindole-3-pyruvic acid (14) is then used in the coupling reaction 137 Fig. 7. Proposed Overall Biosynthetic Pathway of Rebeccamycin. Biosynthetic Pathway of Rebeccamycin with 7-chlorotryptophan catalyzed by RebD to a\u0160ord CCA (4). This dicarboxylic bisindole compound 4 is transformed to the rebeccamycin aglycon (5) via a putative oxidative reaction catalyzed by RebP, and oxidation at the 7-position to the carbonyl by RebC follows. Finally, the rebeccamycin aglycon is glycosylated with D-glucose by RebG (10), and the methylation of the hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety by RebM ends the biosynthesis of rebeccamy-cin. Compared with the rebeccamycin biosynthetic pathway, staurosporin biosynthesis in strain TP-A0274 is proposed to be as follows. Tryptophan would be oxidatively deaminated by StaO to 3-indole pyruvic acid, and it would be used for the coupling reaction with tryptophan catalyzed by StaD to produce chromopyrrolic acid. As the last step of the aglycon biosynthesis, StaP would convert chro-mopyrrolic acid to staurosporine aglycon. Acknowledgments We thank Dr. H.

        "The biosynthetic gene cluster for rebeccamycin, an indolocarbazole antibiotic, from Lechevalieria aer-ocolonigenes ATCC 39243 has 11 ORFs. To clarify their functions, mutants with rebG, rebD, rebC, rebP, rebM, rebR, rebH, rebT, or orfD2 disrupted were constructed, and the gene products were examined. rebP disruptants produced 11,11?-dichlorochromopyrrolic acid, found to be a biosynthetic intermediate by a bioconversion ex-periment. Other genes encoded N-glycosyltransferase (rebG ), monooxygenase (rebC ), methyltransferase (rebM ), a transcriptional activator (rebR), and halo-genase (rebH ). rebT disruptants produced rebeccamy-cin as much as the wild strain, so rebT was probably not involved in rebeccamycin production. Biosynthetic genes of staurosporine, an another indolocarbazole an-tibiotic, were cloned from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274. staO, staD, and staP were similar to rebO, rebD, and rebP, respectively, all of which are responsible for indolocarbazole biosynthesis, But a rebC homolog, encoding a putative enzyme oxidizing the C-7 site of pyrrole rings, was not found in the staurosporine biosynthetic gene cluster. These results suggest that in-dolocarbazole is constructed by oxidative decarboxyla-tion of chromopyrrolic acid (11,11?-dichlorochromo-pyrrolic acid in rebeccamycin) generated from two molecules of tryptophan by coupling and that the oxida-tion state at the C-7 position depends on the additional",

        "Rebeccamycin (Fig. 1) is an indolocarbazole alkaloid produced by Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243.* It inhibits DNA topoisomerase I with an IC50 of 1.75 mM in vitro and inhibits the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma cells with a GI50 of 6.0 mgWml in vivo. 1) Indolocarbazole compounds from natural sources have attracted attention be-cause of they are inhibitors of protein kinases or DNA topoisomerases. Staurosporine (Fig. 1), the strongest inhibitor of phospholipid-Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), with an IC50 of 2.7 nM, is frequently used to study cellular proc-esses.2) Protein kinases and DNA topoisomerases are important in cell proliferation, so speci\u02c6c inhibitors are promising candidates for antitumor drugs. In fact, UCN-01,3) BMY-27557,4) and J-1093845) are indolocarbazoles now in clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy.

Very recently, in a \u02c6rst report about in-dolocarbazole antibiotics, Sanchez et al. cloned the rebeccamycin biosynthetic genes, using an internal fragment of ngt as a probe.11) Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 25.6-kb fragment of the L. aero-colonigenes ATCC 39243 genome found 18 open reading frames (ORFs). On the basis of sequence analysis and database searches, they proposed four genes for indolocarbazole biosynthesis (rebO, rebD, rebC, and rebP ), two genes for halogenation (rebH, and rebF ), glycosylation (rebG, the name was changed from ngt ), and sugar methylation (rebM ), as well as a regulatory gene (rebR) and two resistance and secretion genes (rebU and rebT ). Heterologous gene expression of the set rebO, rebD, rebC, and rebP for indolocarbazole biosynthesis resulted in production of deschlororebeccamycin aglycone. We have been independently investigating the bio-synthetic genes for rebeccamycin,12) and discovered its biosynthetic pathway with the identi\u02c6cation of several key biosynthetic intermediates. We here characterize the biosynthetic gene cluster for rebec-camycin using a newly developed host-vector system for the genus Lechevalieria and gene-disruption ex-periments. The structures of the accumulated products of each reb disruptant were identi\u02c6ed and an overall biosynthetic pathway of rebeccamycin is proposed.",

The rebG product therefore was the N-glycosyltransferase responsible for rebeccamycin biosynthesis. rebD encoded a protein of 1,013 amino acid residue. A BLAST search indicated 36.6z identity over the entire sequence of RebD to VioB, which is involved in violacein (Fig. 1) biosynthesis in Chromobacterium violaceum and catalyzes a con-densation reaction of 5-hydroxytryptophan and in-dolepyruvic acid to generate the bisindole intermedi-ate for violacein.19) The rebD-disrupted mutant did not produce compounds related to indolocarbazoles (Fig. 4(C)); in the same way, the vioB disruptant does not produce any violacein related metabolites.19) rebO, rebD, rebC, and rebP seemed to be transla-tionally coupled, suggesting that at least these four genes might be transcribed polycistronically.

A 13C NMR spectrum showed 11 sp2 car-bons, suggesting that CCA was a symmetrical molec-ule and that all of the carbons in tryptophan were retained in CCA. 1H-13C long-range couplings ob-served in the HMBC spectrum con\u02c6rmed the chlo-roindole moiety (Fig. 5(A)). The presence of a pyr-role ring was not directly con\u02c6rmed by HMBC, but the structure of CCA was deduced to be the chlori-nated analog of chromopyrrolic acid20) by the LC-MS, which gave a molecular ion [M+H]+ at mWz 454.2, and by comparison of NMR results with those reported for chromopyrrolic acid. Chromopyrrolic acid [3,4-di-(3-indolyl)-pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid] is a secondary metabolite found in C. violaceum, a producer of violacein.20) The close similarity of vioB and rebD suggested that CCA was biosynthesized di-rectly by RebD.

We then constructed rebG and rebC double disruptants to eliminate the glycosylated products, and analyzed the fermented products. Three peaks were detected in HPLC of the culture broth (Fig. 4(F), peaks 5, 8, and 9), and they were identi\u02c6ed as rebeccamycin aglycon (5), 7-deoxo-7-hydroxyrebeccamycin aglycon (8), and 7-deoxore-beccamycin aglycon (9), respectively, by NMR.

Taking into account the similarity to the tryptophan halogenase from P. chlororaphis, chlorination probably takes place with tryptophan at the begin-ning of the biosynthetic cascade.

The genomic library of strain TP-A0274 was constructed and the biosynthesis gene was screened for with colony hybridization.

There was no gene similar to rebC in the staurosporine biosynthetic genes in strain TP-A0274. The di\u0160erences in the structures of staurospo-rine and rebeccamycin aglycon were the presence or absence of a carbonyl group at C-7. rebC-disrupted mutants produced 7-deoxo-rebeccamycin, so RebC seemed to catalyze the oxidation at the C-7-position to the carbonyl group.",

On the basis of our results, the biosynthetic pathway for rebeccamycin shown in Fig. 7 is proposed. The initial step is the chlorination of tryptophan by the putative halo-genase RebH. The produced 7-chlorotryptophan (13) is oxidatively deaminated by RebO to give 7-chlo-roindole-3-pyruvic acid (14). The rebO gene product has 25.3z identity in its 473 amino acid sequence to the L-amino acid oxidase from Crotalus adamanteus (eastern diamondback rattlesnake),26) which is a com-ponent of snake poison and catalyzes an oxidization reaction of L-tryptophan to indole-3-pyruvic acid.

Finally, the rebeccamycin aglycon is glycosylated with D-glucose by RebG (10), and the methylation of the hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety by RebM ends the biosynthesis of rebeccamy-cin. Compared with the rebeccamycin biosynthetic pathway, staurosporin biosynthesis in strain TP-A0274 is proposed to be as follows. Tryptophan would be oxidatively deaminated by StaO to 3-indole pyruvic acid, and it would be used for the coupling reaction with tryptophan catalyzed by StaD to produce chromopyrrolic acid.
