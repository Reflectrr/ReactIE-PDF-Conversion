To improve understanding of hypo-osmotic adaptation and to fi nd genes involved in low salinity stress, we con-ducted an analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) on the \u03ba -carrageenan-producing red algae,  Kappaphycus alvarezii . Of 454 tentatively unique genes (TUGs), 281 matched pro-tein sequences by BlastX analysis ( e value  \u2264 10 -3 ), 112 TUGs matched ESTs from other agar-or carrageenan-producing red algae, and 98 TUGs were annotated. The transcriptional profi les of six functional genes from  K. alvarezii ESTs were examined. An ATP-binding cassette transporter gene and a sodium phosphate symporter gene were signifi cantly up-regulated, indicating the importance of membrane transport proteins in coping with hypo-osmotic stress conditions. Keywords:  ATP-binding cassette transporter;  expressed sequence tag;  hypo-osmotic stress;  Kappaphycus alvarezii; sodium phosphate symporter. Introduction Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty ex Silva is an economically important red tropical seaweed that is in high demand because of its cell wall polysaccharide  \u2013 the most important source of \u03ba -carrageenan in the world (Bixler 1996 ). The market for car-rageenan continues to grow, and current sources of cultivated eucheumoids seem incapable of meeting industrial demand in terms of quality, price and volume (Ask et al.  2003 ). Rainfall in equatorial monsoon climates causes prolonged low-salinity stress for seaweeds, and results in signifi cant loss in both biomass and gel strength (Phang et al.  1996 ). Kappaphycus experiences rapid decreases in salinity because of tropical downpours when cultured on shallow, fl oating platforms that are exposed at low tide (Ask and Azanza  2002 ). Liu et al. (unpublished data) demonstrated that some strains of  K. alvarezii soaked in water at a salinity of 28 for 2  h are injured by induced  \u201c ice-ice \u201d disease; more serious  \u201c ice-ice \u201d disease, or even death, occurs in seaweeds soaked in water at a salinity of 22 for 2 h. In seaweeds, hypo-osmotic stress caused by decreased salinity increases external water potential and may trigger excessive uptake of water with concomitant increase of cell volume and turgor pressure, loss of ions and organic solutes, and osmotic shock (Teo et al.  2009 ). In red algae, the molecular mechanisms of hypo-osmotic tolerance of  Chondrus crispus Stackh and  Gracilaria changii (B.M. Xia  et I.A. Abbott) I.A. Abbott, J. Zhang  et B.M. Xia have been explained based on genomic methods. However, there are some contradictory results for these two species (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2007 , Teo et al.  2009 ), such as the up-regulated expres-sion in  G. changii of the vanadium-dependent bromoperoxi-dase gene, which is not differentially expressed in  C. crispus in response to hypo-osmotic conditions. Expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis is one of the most effective means for gene discovery; it is specifi cally relevant to the transcriptome of an organism under different experi-mental conditions. The advance of gene sequence knowledge (e.g., gene annotation) is of crucial importance in revealing underlying mechanisms of physiological phenomena. To date,  > 35,000 EST sequences of economically important red algae have been published, including  Porphyra ,  Gracilaria , and  Chondrus . Many genes involved in stress responses of red algae have been identifi ed (Nikaido et al.  2000 , Asamizu et al.  2003 , Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2006 , Teo et al.  2007 ). A small-scale EST analysis of 311 clones of  Eucheuma denticulatum (N.L.Burman) F.S.Collins  et Hervey, the closest relative spe-cies to  K. alvarezii , has been conducted. More than 60 % of ESTs of  E. denticulatum do not occur in other red algal EST libraries (Aspilla et al.  2010 ). Although it is commercially valuable, fewer studies have been made on genomic functions of  Kappaphycus alvarezii than on many other red algae. The present study primarily focused on building a cDNA library for low salinity stress-induced  K. alvarezii and conducting EST analysis. An attempt was made to identify functional genes and to examine expression patterns of those genes in  K. alvarezii under hypo-osmotic stress. Materials and methods RNA extraction and cDNA library construction Seaweed samples of  Kappaphycus alvarezii were collected from an aquaculture farm off Lingshui, Hainan province in 558  C. Liu et al.: Stress induced genes in  K. alvarezii China in August 2008. After cleaning and soaking in seawa-ter at salinity 28 (seawater diluted with distilled water and salinity calculated with a salinity calibrator) for 2  h, samples were stored at -80 \u00b0 C. Two RNA extraction methods were compared: the fi rst using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Centre, Cincinnati, OH, USA) performed according to the manufacturer \u2019 s recommendations and the second using the CTAB-LiCl protocol performed with minor modifi cations recommended by Zeng and Yang  (2002) . Briefl y, seaweed was ground entirely with liquid nitro-gen and transferred into a 1.5  ml tube containing 600  \u00b5 l of CTAB extraction buffer [2 % (w/v) CTAB (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 2 % (w/v) PVP (Sigma), 100  mmol Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25  mmol EDTA, 2.0  mol NaCl, and 10 % \u03b2 -mercaptoethanol added just before use]. The mixture was blended thoroughly and incubated at 65 \u00b0 C for 10  min with occasional agitation. The solution was extracted twice using an equal volume of chloroform: isoamyl (24:1, v/v), and cen-trifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10  min at 4 \u00b0 C. The upper aqueous phase was transferred into a new tube and then one third of the volume of 8.0  mol LiCl was added. Extracts were mixed well and stored at -80 \u00b0 C for 1  h. After centrifuging and washing with 80 % ethanol, the RNA pellet was dissolved in Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water, and mRNA was purifi ed from total RNA using an mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized by using 5  \u00b5 g of the Poly (A) + RNA and employing a ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). After sizing the fraction, cDNA was ligated into a Uni-zap XR vector and packaged in a Lambda phage with a ZAP-cDNA Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The resulting primary cDNA library containing 1.2 \u00d7 10 6 inde-pendent phages was amplifi ed to 2.3 \u00d7 10 8  pfu ml -1 . EST aligner and function annotation Around 523 clones were randomly selected and sequenced on an ABI 3730 Sequence Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). After sequencing, the vector part was trimmed and all 519 cDNA sequences were assembled into contigs using a CodonCode Aligner ( http://www.codoncode.com/aligner/ ). Tentatively unique genes (TUGs) were compared to both the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nr (non-redundant) protein database and the nucleotide database by using the BlastX algorithm and the BlastN algorithm, respectively. TUGs were also compared with the EST database. Sequences of the ESTs were batch aligned with Blastcl3 programs ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ ), and function annotation was classifi ed with the EGENES database platform (Kanehisa et al.  2006 ; Masoudi -Nejad et al. 2007 ). Real time PCR Transcript profi les of six functional genes: elongation fac-tor EF-3, sodium phosphatesymporter, vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, sulfate adeny-lyltransferase, and ATP-binding cassette were analyzed by real-time PCR. Both actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene were chosen as endogenous controls. Collected  Kappaphycus alvarezii samples were cultured for two days at 25 \u00b0 C, salinity 33 and 12:12 L:D daily photoperiod. Branches (4 \u2013 5 cm) were cut from thalli for low-salinity treat-ment and RNA extraction. The experiment was repeated three times, and  K. alvarezii samples for each test group were taken from a single plant to ensure the homogeny of experimental material. Samples were treated with salinity 28 seawater for 0  h, 1  h, 3  h, 6  h, 12  h, and 24  h. RNA was extracted from the samples and treated with RNase free-DNase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30  min at 37 \u00b0 C. Primers for real-time PCR (Table  1 ) were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 (Premierbiosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Real time PCR was performed in an Mx3005P real time PCR machine (Stratagene) using a SYBR  \u00ae  PrimeScript  \u2122  RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer \u2019 s instructions. Forty cycle reactions were conducted (95 \u00b0 C for 10  s; annealing for 10  s; 72 \u00b0 C for 20  s). To evaluate amplifi cation of primers, standard curves of each pair of primers were constructed and PCR effi ciencies were calculated from the slopes of the curves. Real time PCR effi ciencies for endogenous controls and genes examined ranged from 95 % to 105 % . Reactions were per-formed in triplicate and relative gene expression determina-tions were made with the comparative \u2206-\u2206  C T method (2 -\u2206 \u2206 CT ) described by Livak and Schmittgen  (2001) . Results RNA extraction and cDNA library construction Construction of the cDNA library for an organism rich in polysaccharides and proteins is frequently problematic because of the low yield of RNA extraction. RNA extraction from  Kappaphycus alvarezii was performed using two differ-ent extraction methods. Higher quality RNA was obtained by using the CTAB-LiCl method compared with low yield and poor quality of RNA obtained by using TRI reagent; with TRI reagent, considerable amounts of polysaccharide still remained in the RNA sample. After CTAB-LiCl extraction, electropho-resis on agarose gels indicated that little RNA degradation had occurred, and the OD 260/280 ratios of 1.8\u20132.0 showed that very little protein or polysaccharide contaminated the K. alvarezii RNA product. Forty-eight colonies were randomly selected to test the fragment length of cDNA in the cDNA library constructed. Twelve clones were longer than 2000  bps and only one clone was shorter than 500  bps, indicating the integrity of mRNA for  Kappaphycus alvarezii cDNA library construction. General characteristics of  Kappaphycus ESTs Single pass sequencing of the amplifi ed cDNA library of  K. alvarezii generated 523 ESTs. Five sequences contaminated by cloning vectors or low-quality sequences were not ana-lyzed. The 518 readable sequences consisted of 454 tenta-tively unique genes (TUGs) that were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers from HS416812 to HS417265. Of C. Liu et al.: Stress induced genes in  K. alvarezii 559the 454 TUGs, there were 403 tentatively unique singletons (TUSs) and 51 tentatively unique contigs (TUCs) that were assembled by 109 ESTs. Two hundred and eighty one of the 454 TUGs (62 % ) matched signifi cantly with sequences in the non-redundant protein database ( e value  \u2264   0 -3 ), which con-tains genes encoding both  \u201c known proteins \u201d and  \u201c predicted/unknown proteins \u201d based on BlastX results. After searching the EST database, 89 ESTs from Kappaphycus alvarezii fi rst hit ESTs from  Eucheuma den-ticulatum , and 23 ESTs fi rst hit those from  Chondrus crispus , Gracilaria lemaneiformis (Bory de Saint-Vincent) Greville, and  Gracilaria changii . Nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 81% to  89 % for  K. alvarezii and other red algae. Gene function annotation of  Kappaphycus ESTs Of the 454 TUGs from  K.alvarezii , 98 (21.6 % ) were annotated and assigned into 8 KEGG orthology (KO) groups analyzed by the EGENE database platform (Figure 1). Proportions of the 98 annotated ESTs that fell into  \u201c metabolism \u201d ,  \u201c translation \u201d , \u201c folding, sorting and degradation \u201d ,  \u201c transcription \u201d ,  \u201c cellular process \u201d ,  \u201c replication and repair \u201d ,  \u201c organismal system \u201d , and \u201c environmental information processing \u201d are shown in Figure  1 . Transcripts involved in metabolic pathways of  K. alvarezii are listed in Table  2 . Genes differentially expressed under hypo-osmotic stress identifi ed by real time PCR To investigate expression patterns under hypo-osmotic stress conditions, we examined transcript profi les of six functional genes isolated from  Kappaphycus alvarezii ESTs (Figure  2 ). Samples were treated separately in sea-water at a salinity of 28 for 1  h, 3  h, 6  h, 12  h, and 24  h. The expressions of several genes were up-regulated. The most signifi cant changes occurred in the ATP-binding cas-sette gene, with an approximately 8-fold increase in salinity 28 treatment for 6  h compared with 0  h. The transcription of the ATP-binding cassette gene stayed high during the course of treatment from 1  h to12  h, reaching maximum at 6  h and decreasing thereafter. Another signifi cantly changed transcription was for the gene encoding sodium phosphate symporter, which increased about 5-fold when treated at salinity 28 for 3  h compared with 0  h. The sulfate adenyltransferase gene had an expression pattern similar to that of the sodium phosphate symporter gene, with  < 4-fold up-regulation after treatment in salinity 28 water for 3  h compared with 0  h. Pyruvate dehydrogenase gene expres-sion was consistently up-regulated by about 3-fold from 1  h to 12  h compared with 0  h. The up-regulation of vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase was  < 2-fold at 1  h, but expression was down-regulated at other Table 1  Kappaphycus alvarezii : primers used in real-time PCR assays. 560  C. Liu et al.: Stress induced genes in  K. alvarezii Table 2  Kappaphycus alvarezii : ESTs in primary and other biological processes shown by KEGG orthology annotation. C. Liu et al.: Stress induced genes in  K. alvarezii 561 A pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit  \u03b1 (PdhA) gene was also up-regulated by low salinity stress in this study. It encodes a mitochondrial PdhA protein. Mitochondrial Pdh protein is the site of carbon entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Tovar -M \u00e9 ndez et al. 2003 ). The up-regulation of PdhA gene expression in low salinity water indicates that energy metabolism is important under this stress. PdhA and PdhD pro-teins of  Listeria monocytogenes (E.G.D. Murray, R.E. Webb, M.B.R. Swann) P.J.H Pirie that are highly induced by salt stress may be vital enzymes that are rather salt sensitive and whose production is necessary to keep up a minimal level of catabolic metabolism (Duch \u00e9 et al. 2002 ). Thus, we suggest that eleva-tion of carbon assimilation by over-expression of PdhA may be important in seaweed acclimation to hypo-osmotic stress. Sulfate adenylyltransferase, the fi rst enzyme in the plant sulfate assimilation pathway, catalyzes formation of adenos-ine phosphosulfate from ATP and sulfate. Hypo-osmotic stress may induce the over-expression of the sulfate adeny-lyltransferase gene in  Kappaphycus alvarezii . A sulfate adenylyltransferase gene was chosen as a marker locus for hypo-osmotic stress in  Chondrus crispus because its expres-sion is up-regulated only in response to this stressor (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2007 ). The vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase (vBPO) gene, which is involved in reactive oxygen metabolism (ROM), is an important functional gene in red and brown algae (Dring 2005 ). BPO in red algae, such as  Eucheuma denticula-tum (Mtolera et al.  1996 ) and  Meristiella gelidium (J.Agardh) D.P.Cheney  et P.W.Gabrielson (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 1994 ), produces volatile halogenated compounds when exposed to stress con-ditions that include elevated pH and high light intensities. The vBPO gene was shown (using the cDNA microarray approach) to be up-regulated in  Gracilaria changii in response to both hyper-osmotic and hypo-osmotic conditions (Teo et al. 2009 ). The up-regulation of vBPO was not signifi cant in this study; however, its expression in  Chondrus crispus was found (using the cDNA microarray approach) to be down-regulated by both high and low salinity stresses (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2007 ), but real-time PCR methodology did not detect differential expres-sion of vBPO in this species under hypo-osmotic conditions (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2007 ). A vBPO has been isolated from  K. alva-rezii and the enzyme activated is specifi c for Br -and I -ions (Kamenarska et al.  2007 ). We suggest that decreases in Br -and I -ion concentrations in hypo-osmotic conditions may repress vBPO gene transcription and that would reduce elimination of H 2 O 2 ; the excessive H 2 O 2 may then stress the algae. There appears to be a coordinated action of translation ini-tiation and elongation factors operating together with several accessory proteins that regulate stress-associated translation in controlling various cellular adaptations during salt stress (Sahi et al.  2006 ). The expression of translation elongation factor 3 was detected in  Kappaphycus alvarezii and it was slightly down-regulated under hypo-osmotic conditions. The roles of transcriptional and translational machineries during low salinity adaptation require further study. Other than genes responding to hypo-osmotic stress, we attempted to identify loci involved in carrageenan synthesis in Kappaphycus alvarezii . Arylsulfatase B was the sole transcript involved in glycan metabolism in this study. Arylsulfatase has been detected in  Chlamydomonas under sulfur-deprived con-ditions; the enzyme cleaves sulfate from aromatic compounds and enables cells to use these molecules as a source of sulfur when free sulfate is not available (Davies et al.  1994 ). Blastx analysis indicated that the arylsulfatase gene from  K. alvarezii resembles that of the bacterium  Pseudoalteromonas atlantica (Akagawa-Matsushita, Matsuo, Koga  et Yamasato) Gauthier, 11 0 h1 h3 h6 h12 h24 h10 9 8 7 6 5 R el at iv e ab un da nc e of  tran sc rip ts (fo ld  cha ng e of  gen e ex pr es si on ) 4 3 2 1 0 vBPO Na/Pi symporter PDHA EF-3 ATP-binding cassette ALDSulfate adenylyltransferase -1 Figure 2  Kappaphycus alvarezii : Relative abundance of transcripts (fold-change of gene expression) of selected candidate loci after 562  C. Liu et al.: Stress induced genes in  K. alvarezii Gauthier  et Christen T6c (Score =  391 bits, Expect  = 7e-107). Arylsulfatase isolated from the bacterium  Sphingomonas sp. AS6330 hydrolyzes sulfate ester bonds in agar, and the sul-fate ester hydrolytic enzyme activity on agar is higher than on other sulfated marine polysaccharides such as porphyran, fucoidan, and carrageenan (Kim et al.  2004 ). The role of arylsulfatase in the synthesis or hydrolysis of carrageenan in K. alvarezii should be clarifi ed through detection of enzyme activities in future studies. In conclusion, although the annotation rate of red algae ESTs was low, several genes controlling various cellular adaptations during hypo-osmotic stress on  K. alvarezii were identifi ed. Combining KO annotation with real time PCR analysis proved effi cient in determining and characterizing gene functions during low-salinity stress.

        "Hypo-osmotic conditions are among the most stressful envi-ronmental factors that affect seaweed physiology and produc-tivity. To improve understanding of hypo-osmotic adaptation and to fi nd genes involved in low salinity stress, we con-ducted an analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) on the \u03ba -carrageenan-producing red algae,  Kappaphycus alvarezii . Of 454 tentatively unique genes (TUGs), 281 matched pro-tein sequences by BlastX analysis ( e value  \u2264 10 -3 ), 112 TUGs matched ESTs from other agar-or carrageenan-producing red algae, and 98 TUGs were annotated. The transcriptional profi les of six functional genes from  K. alvarezii ESTs were examined. An ATP-binding cassette transporter gene and a sodium phosphate symporter gene were signifi cantly up-regulated, indicating the importance of membrane transport proteins in coping with hypo-osmotic stress conditions.",

        "Introduction",
        "Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty ex Silva is an economically important red tropical seaweed that is in high demand because of its cell wall polysaccharide  \u2013 the most important source of \u03ba -carrageenan in the world (Bixler 1996 ). The market for car-rageenan continues to grow, and current sources of cultivated eucheumoids seem incapable of meeting industrial demand in terms of quality, price and volume (Ask et al.  2003 ).",
        "Rainfall in equatorial monsoon climates causes prolonged low-salinity stress for seaweeds, and results in signifi cant loss in both biomass and gel strength (Phang et al.  1996 ). Kappaphycus experiences rapid decreases in salinity because of tropical downpours when cultured on shallow, fl oating platforms that are exposed at low tide (Ask and Azanza  2002 ). Liu et al. (unpublished data) demonstrated that some strains of  K. alvarezii soaked in water at a salinity of 28 for 2  h are injured by induced  \u201c ice-ice \u201d disease; more serious  \u201c ice-ice \u201d disease, or even death, occurs in seaweeds soaked in water at a salinity of 22 for 2 h. In seaweeds, hypo-osmotic stress caused by decreased salinity increases external water potential and may trigger excessive uptake of water with concomitant increase of cell volume and turgor pressure, loss of ions and organic solutes, and osmotic shock (Teo et al.  2009 ). In red algae, the molecular mechanisms of hypo-osmotic tolerance of  Chondrus crispus Stackh and  Gracilaria changii (B.M. Xia  et I.A. Abbott) I.A. Abbott, J. Zhang  et B.M. Xia have been explained based on genomic methods. However, there are some contradictory results for these two species (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2007 , Teo et al.  2009 ), such as the up-regulated expres-sion in  G. changii of the vanadium-dependent bromoperoxi-dase gene, which is not differentially expressed in  C. crispus in response to hypo-osmotic conditions.",
        "Expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis is one of the most effective means for gene discovery; it is specifi cally relevant to the transcriptome of an organism under different experi-mental conditions. The advance of gene sequence knowledge (e.g., gene annotation) is of crucial importance in revealing underlying mechanisms of physiological phenomena. To date,  > 35,000 EST sequences of economically important red algae have been published, including  Porphyra ,  Gracilaria , and  Chondrus . Many genes involved in stress responses of red algae have been identifi ed (Nikaido et al.  2000 , Asamizu et al.  2003 , Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2006 , Teo et al.  2007 ). A small-scale EST analysis of 311 clones of  Eucheuma denticulatum (N.L.Burman) F.S.Collins  et Hervey, the closest relative spe-cies to  K. alvarezii , has been conducted. More than 60 % of ESTs of  E. denticulatum do not occur in other red algal EST libraries (Aspilla et al.  2010 ).",
        "Although it is commercially valuable, fewer studies have been made on genomic functions of  Kappaphycus alvarezii than on many other red algae. The present study primarily focused on building a cDNA library for low salinity stress-induced  K. alvarezii and conducting EST analysis. An attempt was made to identify functional genes and to examine expression patterns of those genes in  K. alvarezii under hypo-osmotic stress.",
        "Materials and methods",
        "RNA extraction and cDNA library construction",

        "China in August 2008. After cleaning and soaking in seawa-ter at salinity 28 (seawater diluted with distilled water and salinity calculated with a salinity calibrator) for 2  h, samples were stored at -80 \u00b0 C. Two RNA extraction methods were compared: the fi rst using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Centre, Cincinnati, OH, USA) performed according to the manufacturer \u2019 s recommendations and the second using the CTAB-LiCl protocol performed with minor modifi cations recommended by Zeng and Yang  (2002) .",
        "Briefl y, seaweed was ground entirely with liquid nitro-gen and transferred into a 1.5  ml tube containing 600  \u00b5 l of CTAB extraction buffer [2 % (w/v) CTAB (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 2 % (w/v) PVP (Sigma), 100  mmol Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25  mmol EDTA, 2.0  mol NaCl, and 10 % \u03b2 -mercaptoethanol added just before use]. The mixture was blended thoroughly and incubated at 65 \u00b0 C for 10  min with occasional agitation. The solution was extracted twice using an equal volume of chloroform: isoamyl (24:1, v/v), and cen-trifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10  min at 4 \u00b0 C. The upper aqueous phase was transferred into a new tube and then one third of the volume of 8.0  mol LiCl was added. Extracts were mixed well and stored at -80 \u00b0 C for 1  h. After centrifuging and washing with 80 % ethanol, the RNA pellet was dissolved in Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water, and mRNA was purifi ed from total RNA using an mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized by using 5  \u00b5 g of the Poly (A) + RNA and employing a ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). After sizing the fraction, cDNA was ligated into a Uni-zap XR vector and packaged in a Lambda phage with a ZAP-cDNA Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The resulting primary cDNA library containing 1.2 \u00d7 10 6 inde-pendent phages was amplifi ed to 2.3 \u00d7 10 8  pfu ml -1 .",
        "EST aligner and function annotation",
        "Around 523 clones were randomly selected and sequenced on an ABI 3730 Sequence Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). After sequencing, the vector part was trimmed and all 519 cDNA sequences were assembled into contigs using a CodonCode Aligner ( http://www.codoncode.com/aligner/ ). Tentatively unique genes (TUGs) were compared to both the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nr (non-redundant) protein database and the nucleotide database by using the BlastX algorithm and the BlastN algorithm, respectively. TUGs were also compared with the EST database. Sequences of the ESTs were batch aligned with Blastcl3 programs ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ ), and function annotation was classifi ed with the EGENES database platform (Kanehisa et al.  2006 ; Masoudi -Nejad et al. 2007 ).",
        "Real time PCR",
        "Transcript profi les of six functional genes: elongation fac-tor EF-3, sodium phosphatesymporter, vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, sulfate adeny-lyltransferase, and ATP-binding cassette were analyzed by real-time PCR. Both actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene were chosen as endogenous controls.",
        "Collected  Kappaphycus alvarezii samples were cultured for two days at 25 \u00b0 C, salinity 33 and 12:12 L:D daily photoperiod. Branches (4 \u2013 5 cm) were cut from thalli for low-salinity treat-ment and RNA extraction. The experiment was repeated three times, and  K. alvarezii samples for each test group were taken from a single plant to ensure the homogeny of experimental material. Samples were treated with salinity 28 seawater for 0  h, 1  h, 3  h, 6  h, 12  h, and 24  h. RNA was extracted from the samples and treated with RNase free-DNase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30  min at 37 \u00b0 C. Primers for real-time PCR (Table  1 ) were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 (Premierbiosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Real time PCR was performed in an Mx3005P real time PCR machine (Stratagene) using a SYBR  \u00ae  PrimeScript  \u2122  RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer \u2019 s instructions. Forty cycle reactions were conducted (95 \u00b0 C for 10  s; annealing for 10  s; 72 \u00b0 C for 20  s). To evaluate amplifi cation of primers, standard curves of each pair of primers were constructed and PCR effi ciencies were calculated from the slopes of the curves. Real time PCR effi ciencies for endogenous controls and genes examined ranged from 95 % to 105 % . Reactions were per-formed in triplicate and relative gene expression determina-tions were made with the comparative \u2206-\u2206  C T method (2 -\u2206 \u2206 CT ) described by Livak and Schmittgen  (2001) .",
        "Results",
        "RNA extraction and cDNA library construction",
        "Construction of the cDNA library for an organism rich in polysaccharides and proteins is frequently problematic because of the low yield of RNA extraction. RNA extraction from  Kappaphycus alvarezii was performed using two differ-ent extraction methods. Higher quality RNA was obtained by using the CTAB-LiCl method compared with low yield and poor quality of RNA obtained by using TRI reagent; with TRI reagent, considerable amounts of polysaccharide still remained in the RNA sample. After CTAB-LiCl extraction, electropho-resis on agarose gels indicated that little RNA degradation had occurred, and the OD 260/280 ratios of 1.8\u20132.0 showed that very little protein or polysaccharide contaminated the K. alvarezii RNA product.",
        "Forty-eight colonies were randomly selected to test the fragment length of cDNA in the cDNA library constructed. Twelve clones were longer than 2000  bps and only one clone was shorter than 500  bps, indicating the integrity of mRNA for  Kappaphycus alvarezii cDNA library construction.",
        "General characteristics of  Kappaphycus ESTs",
        "Single pass sequencing of the amplifi ed cDNA library of  K. alvarezii generated 523 ESTs. Five sequences contaminated by cloning vectors or low-quality sequences were not ana-lyzed.

        "Genes differentially expressed under hypo-osmotic stress identifi ed by real time PCR",
        "To investigate expression patterns under hypo-osmotic stress conditions, we examined transcript profi les of six functional genes isolated from  Kappaphycus alvarezii ESTs (Figure  2 ). Samples were treated separately in sea-water at a salinity of 28 for 1  h, 3  h, 6  h, 12  h, and 24  h. The expressions of several genes were up-regulated. The most signifi cant changes occurred in the ATP-binding cas-sette gene, with an approximately 8-fold increase in salinity 28 treatment for 6  h compared with 0  h. The transcription of the ATP-binding cassette gene stayed high during the course of treatment from 1  h to12  h, reaching maximum at 6  h and decreasing thereafter. Another signifi cantly changed transcription was for the gene encoding sodium phosphate symporter, which increased about 5-fold when treated at salinity 28 for 3  h compared with 0  h. The sulfate adenyltransferase gene had an expression pattern similar to that of the sodium phosphate symporter gene, with  < 4-fold up-regulation after treatment in salinity 28 water for 3  h compared with 0  h. Pyruvate dehydrogenase gene expres-sion was consistently up-regulated by about 3-fold from 1  h to 12  h compared with 0  h.",

        "561 A pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit  \u03b1 (PdhA) gene was also up-regulated by low salinity stress in this study. It encodes a mitochondrial PdhA protein. Mitochondrial Pdh protein is the site of carbon entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Tovar -M \u00e9 ndez et al. 2003 ). The up-regulation of PdhA gene expression in low salinity water indicates that energy metabolism is important under this stress. PdhA and PdhD pro-teins of  Listeria monocytogenes (E.G.D. Murray, R.E. Webb, M.B.R. Swann) P.J.H Pirie that are highly induced by salt stress may be vital enzymes that are rather salt sensitive and whose production is necessary to keep up a minimal level of catabolic metabolism (Duch \u00e9 et al. 2002 ). Thus, we suggest that eleva-tion of carbon assimilation by over-expression of PdhA may be important in seaweed acclimation to hypo-osmotic stress.",
        "Sulfate adenylyltransferase, the fi rst enzyme in the plant sulfate assimilation pathway, catalyzes formation of adenos-ine phosphosulfate from ATP and sulfate. Hypo-osmotic stress may induce the over-expression of the sulfate adeny-lyltransferase gene in  Kappaphycus alvarezii . A sulfate adenylyltransferase gene was chosen as a marker locus for hypo-osmotic stress in  Chondrus crispus because its expres-sion is up-regulated only in response to this stressor (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2007 ).",
        "The vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase (vBPO) gene, which is involved in reactive oxygen metabolism (ROM), is an important functional gene in red and brown algae (Dring 2005 ). BPO in red algae, such as  Eucheuma denticula-tum (Mtolera et al.  1996 ) and  Meristiella gelidium (J.Agardh) D.P.Cheney  et P.W.Gabrielson (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 1994 ), produces volatile halogenated compounds when exposed to stress con-ditions that include elevated pH and high light intensities. The vBPO gene was shown (using the cDNA microarray approach) to be up-regulated in  Gracilaria changii in response to both hyper-osmotic and hypo-osmotic conditions (Teo et al. 2009 ). The up-regulation of vBPO was not signifi cant in this study; however, its expression in  Chondrus crispus was found (using the cDNA microarray approach) to be down-regulated by both high and low salinity stresses (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2007 ), but real-time PCR methodology did not detect differential expres-sion of vBPO in this species under hypo-osmotic conditions (Coll \u00e9 n et al. 2007 ). A vBPO has been isolated from  K. alva-rezii and the enzyme activated is specifi c for Br -and I -ions (Kamenarska et al.  2007 ). We suggest that decreases in Br -and I -ion concentrations in hypo-osmotic conditions may repress vBPO gene transcription and that would reduce elimination of H 2 O 2 ; the excessive H 2 O 2 may then stress the algae.",
        "There appears to be a coordinated action of translation ini-tiation and elongation factors operating together with several accessory proteins that regulate stress-associated translation in controlling various cellular adaptations during salt stress (Sahi et al.  2006 ). The expression of translation elongation factor 3 was detected in  Kappaphycus alvarezii and it was slightly down-regulated under hypo-osmotic conditions. The roles of transcriptional and translational machineries during low salinity adaptation require further study.",

Arylsulfatase B was the sole transcript involved in glycan metabolism in this study. Arylsulfatase has been detected in  Chlamydomonas under sulfur-deprived con-ditions; the enzyme cleaves sulfate from aromatic compounds and enables cells to use these molecules as a source of sulfur when free sulfate is not available (Davies et al.  1994 ).
