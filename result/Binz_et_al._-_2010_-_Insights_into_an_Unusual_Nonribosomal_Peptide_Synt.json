Fantoli, 16/15, Milan 20138, Italy The GE81112 tetrapeptides (1\u20133) represent a structurally unique class of antibiotics, acting as specific inhibitors of pro-karyotic protein synthesis. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. L-49973 and the development of a genetic manipulation system for Streptomyces sp. L-49973. The biosyn-thetic gene cluster for the tetrapeptide antibiotic GE81112 (getA-N) was identified within a 61.7-kb region comprising 29 open reading frames (open reading frames), 14 of which were assigned to the biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis re-vealed the GE81112 cluster to consist of six nonribosomal pep-tide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding incomplete di-domain NRPS modules and a single free standing NRPS domain as well as genes encoding other biosynthetic and modifying proteins. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in GE81112 biosyn-thesis was confirmed by inactivating the NRPS gene getE result-ing in a GE81112 production abolished mutant. In addition, we characterized the NRPS A-domains from the pathway by expression inEscherichia coli and in vitro enzymatic assays. The previously unknown stereochemistry of most chiral centers in GE81112 was established from a combined chemical and bio-synthetic approach.Taken together, these findings have allowed us to propose a rational model for GE81112 biosynthesis. The results further open the door to developing new derivatives of these promising antibiotic compounds by genetic engineering. The emergence of multi-drug resistant microbial pathogens is driving the search for novel antibiotics with newmechanisms of action and natural products continue to provide original scaffolds affecting essential bacterial targets (1, 2). As it is cur-rently understood, most antibiotics act in three basic ways; 1) inhibition of DNA replication and repair, 2) inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis, and 3) inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Pro-tein translation and cell wall biosynthesis in bacteria are cur-rently the targets for the majority of antimicrobial natural products. The former is the target of the macrolides (e.g. eryth-romycin), the aminoglycosides (e.g. kanamycin), the strepto-gramins, the lincosamides, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol as well as of other classes of compounds that are not in clinical use. These compounds have been shown to affect protein bio-synthesis at various steps (3, 4). Some aspects of protein translation are rarely targeted, e.g. translation initiation andpolypeptide chain termination.Amicro-bial product screening program aimed at discovering novel inhib-itors of bacterial protein synthesis revealed the new tetrapeptide GE81112compounds (1-3) (Fig. 1) to selectively inhibit the forma-tion of the prokaryotic 30 S initiation complex with an IC50 None 0.9 NoneM (5). Todate, threeGE81112 congeners, A (1), B (2), andB1 (3), have been described from a Streptomyces sp. (Fig. 1). Extensive NMR and MS studies revealed the tetrapeptides to comprise hydroxypipecolic and hydroxypentanoic acids, an (amino)histi-dine, and a hydroxychlorohistidine (5). A retro-biosynthetic anal-ysis of the GE81112 core structure suggests a NRPS2 origin with additional tailoringstepsoccurringat somepointduringassembly. NRPSmultienzymes are composed of successive catalytic units or \u201cdomains\u201d that are themselves organized into biosynthetic mod-ules which catalyze the assembly reactions in a coordinated, often \u201cco-linear\u201d manner. Normally, each module in the assembly line performs one cycle of chain extension (condensation of one resi-due into the growing peptide chain). A typical, minimal NRPS module consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)domain (also referred to as a thiolation (T)domain), and a condensation (C) domain (6). However, a growing number of gene clusters encode systems that deviate in their domain orga-nization from the standard C-A-PCP architecture and comprise partialmodulesor isolateddomainsacting in trans to complement the functionality of the multimodular NRPSs (7\u20139). To better understand GE81112 biosynthesis and to generate structural analogues, we sought to develop a strategy for the clon-ing and identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster. To this end, the clusterwas identifiedon twooverlapping cosmids. In addition, weexpressed fiveA-domains fromthecorrespondingNRPSgenes and characterized them in vitro.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions\u2014Streptomyces sp. L-49973 was grown in INA5 (glycerol, 30 g literNone1; soya extract, 15 g literNone1; CaCO3, 5 g literNone1; NaCl, 2 g literNone1) or T6 (glyc-erol, 45 g literNone1; soya extract, 25 g literNone1; CaCO3, 2 g literNone1) media in baffled flasks for production of GE81112. Pre-cultures were grown in V6 medium (glucose, 20 g literNone1; meat extract, 5 g literNone1; yeast extract, 5 g literNone1; peptone 5 g literNone1; caseine, 3 g literNone1; NaCl, 1.5 g literNone1, pH 7.5) and used to inoculate production culture (1:100). The cultures were maintained at 30 \u00b0C and 180 rpm on a rotary incubator and harvested after 6 days. Escherichia coli DH10B, E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002, and E. coli SURE were grown in liquid LB medium at 37 or 30 \u00b0C with the appropriate antibiotic selection. Antibiotic concentra-tions were as follows; apramycin (60 Noneg mlNone1), chlorampheni-col (34 Noneg mlNone1), kanamycin (60 Noneg/mlNone1), and ampicillin (100 Noneg mlNone1) were used for selection in E. coli. Apramycin (60 Noneg mlNone1) was used for selection of Streptomyces sp. L-49973 recombinants. Nalidixic acid (25 Nonel mlNone1) was used to select against E. coli donor after conjugation. Molecular Biology Methods\u2014The pET28b (None) (Novagen) and pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) cloning vectors were from commercial sources; pKC1132 and pOJ436were described pre-viously (10). Restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas. All PCRs were carried out using Taq (MBI Fermen-tas) or Phusion (Invitrogen) polymerase. DMSO was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 5%. Conditions for amplification with a Peqlab ThermoCycler were as follows: denaturation, 15\u201330 s at 95/98 \u00b0C; annealing, 8\u201320 s at 50\u201362 \u00b0C; extension, 15\u201360 s at 72 \u00b0C (30 cycles); final exten-sion at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the GeneJETTM Plas-mid Miniprep kit (Fermentas). DNA fragments from agarose gel were isolated and purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel). All other DNA manipulations in E. coli (11) and Streptomyces (10) were carried out using standard pro-tocols. For colony hybridization analysis, digoxigenin labeling of DNA probes, hybridization, and detection were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Roche Diagnostics). Construction of a Streptomyces sp. L-49973 Genomic Cosmid Library\u2014A Streptomyces sp. L-49973 genomic cosmid library was constructed in E. coli SURE. Genomic DNA was isolated with the salting out procedure (10). Then theDNAwas partially digested with Sau3A, yielding fragments with an average size greater than 35 kb. The fragments were ligated into cosmid vector pOJ436 (12) digested with BamHI and PvuII and in vitro packaged with the Gigapack III Gold packaging extract kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s handbook (Stratagene). 2304 colonies were transferred into six 384-well microtiter plates using a Qbot robot (Genetix) and grown overnight in 2YT medium. For storage at None80 \u00b0C, 50 Nonel of freezing solution (0.076% MgSO4None7 H2O, 0.45% sodium citrateNone2 H2O, 0.9% NH4SO4, 44% glycerol, 4.7% K2HPO4, 1.8% KH2PO4) was added to each well. Robotically produced high density colony arrays (Hybond NNone, Amersham Biosciences) were utilized for the screening of the cosmid clones, as described previously (13). Screening of a Streptomyces sp. L-49973 Genomic Cosmid Library\u2014Cyclodeaminase and NRPS fragment sequences were initially used as probes under low stringency conditions. To create the cyclodeaminase probe, we used specific primers to amplify two known cyclodeaminase genes, tubZ (14) (primers Tubz_up and TubZ_down, 570-bp product)m from the tubuly-sin cluster, and rapL (15), from the rapamycin cluster (primers RapL_up and RapL_down, 534-bp PCR product) (see the prim-ers in supplemental Table S1). As an alternative approach, we designed an additional probe to identify NRPS genes. For this, we used degenerate NRPS primers; NRPS-A1-up and NRPS-H1-dn (supplemental Table S1). These primers amplify A-do-mains between the structural regionsA3 andA6 (16), where the amino acid binding pocket is located, giving a 760-bp PCR frag-ment. The ampliconswere labeledwith digoxigenin and used to probe the cosmid library at low stringency (40 \u00b0C). Several cos-mids that hybridized with both probes were subjected to PCR analysis for the amplification of the cyclodeaminase and NRPS A-domains. In the first screeningwe identified a cosmid encod-ing a putative cyclodeaminase but not the expected GE81112 biosynthetic enzymes. A segment of this cyclodeaminase was amplified using the primers Cyclo_probe_for and Cyclo_probe_ rev (supplemental Table S1) and used under high stringency conditions (42 \u00b0C) for further screening of the library. Cosmids hybridizing with this probe were analyzed by PCR using prim-ers to amplify the cyclodeaminase and NRPS A-domains again. The resulting PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector and sequenced. Several NRPS sequences were found from different cosmids, and the eight critical residues responsible for substrate recognition could be determined enabling an in silico prediction of the substrate specificity of each cloned A-domain fragment. Cosmids har-boringA-domains thatwere predicted to activate pipecolic acid were digested with BamHI, and the restriction pattern was compared with identify similar cosmids. End sequencing of the cosmids was carried out using primers T4 and T7 (supplemen-tal Table S1). One cosmid (BI11) was identified containing a large part of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster. To find a cosmid that overlapped with the 3None (T7) end of the cluster, a 1-kb fragment was amplified from the T7 end of cosmid BI11 (primers BI11-T7end-for and BI11-T7end-rev, supplemental Table S1) to serve as a probe. The cosmid library was then screened with the new probe, with hybridization at 42 \u00b0C. Among the identified cosmids, BA23 showed the smallest extent of overlap with BI11 based on PCR analysis and restric-tion digest. Cosmids BI11 and BA23 were shotgun-sequenced on both strands as described previously (17). Data Analysis\u2014The annotation analysis of the sequence data was performed through FramePlot analysis (FramePlot 4.Obeta) (23) and data base comparison with the basic align-ment search tool (BLAST) on the server of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. For alignment analysis of the sequence data, ClustalW on the server of EMBL-EBI was used. Specificity of the A-domains was determined by using the NRPS predictor Bioinformatics Toolbox from University of Tu\u0308bingen and polyketide synthase/NRPS analysis web site. GE81112 Biosynthetic Gene Cluster OCTOBER 22, 2010 \u2022 VOLUME 285 \u2022 NUMBER 43 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 32711 Conjugation andGeneration ofMutant Strains of Streptomy-ces sp. L-49973\u2014DNA manipulation was carried out with E. coli DH10B as the host strain. To generate knock-out mutants by means of insert-directed homologous recombina-tion, a 572-bp internal fragment of gene getEwas amplifiedwith primers pipA_for and pipA_rev (supplemental Table S1). The fragments were cloned into pCR2.1TOPO, and the constructs were digested with EcoRI. The fragments were ligated into knock-out vector pKC1132 (10) digested with EcoRI. The final pKC1132-derived plasmids were introduced into Streptomyces sp. L-49973 by intergeneric conjugation with the methylation-deficient donor strain E. coli ET12567 containing the conjuga-tive vector pUZ8002 (10).Mutants were analyzed by PCR using appropriate control primers. One primer was designed to bind to the integrated vector backbone (lacZ1, lacZ2), whereas the second primer was designed to target the genome sequence either up-or downstream of the integration site (A1_for, A1_rev) (supplemental Table S1). PCR of the mutants yielded distinct amplicons, whereas no products were detected from the wild type. Analysis of GE81112 Production in Streptomyces sp. L-49973\u2014 Streptomyces strains (wild types and mutants) were cultured in 500-ml baffled shake flasks containing 100 ml of GE81112 pro-duction medium (INA5 or T6) at 30 \u00b0C and 180 rpm. Recombi-nant strains were amended with apramycin (60 Noneg mlNone1). A square of agar from a sporulating SM agar plate was used for inoculation. After 6 days of cultivation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5min. The culture supernatant was extracted two times with ethyl acetate, evaporated, and redissolved in 500 Nonel of methanol. LC-coupled FT-Orbit-rap-MS analysis was carried out with an Accella UPLC system (Thermo Electron Corp.) operating in positive ionizationmode at a scan range of m/z 100\u20132000. A Hypersil Gold column (2.1 None 50 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for separa-tion with a solvent system consisting of H2O (A) and acetoni-trile (B), each containing 0.1% formic acid. A gradient of 5\u201395% B was applied over 10 min. Measurements were carried out in single ion mode. GE81112 compounds were identified by com-parison to the retention times and the MS data of authentic standards (GE congener A: [MNoneH]None None 644.21858; GE conge-ner B: [MNoneH]None None 659.22953; GE congener B1: [MNoneH]None None 658.24587) in the positive ionization mode. Construction of A-domain Overexpression Constructs\u2014The genes encoding for the five A-domains (GetEA1, GetGA2, GetGA3, GetJA4, and GetMA5) of GE81112 were PCR-ampli-fied from cosmids BI11 and BA23. The forward and reverse primers for amplification of A-domain fragments getEA1, getGA2, getGA3, and getMA5 introduced NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (supplemental Table S1). A-domain fragment getJA4 could not be amplified from the cosmids, probably due to the highGC content. Therefore, theA-domain sequencewas synthesized, and theGCcontentwas optimized for use inE. coli (ATG::biosynthetics GmbH). The fragment was obtained in pBluescript SKNone (pBSK) vector flanked by restriction sites NdeI and EcoRI (supplemental Fig. S1). All PCR products were cloned into the digested pET28b (None) vector using the corre-sponding NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. Fragment getJA4 was obtained after restriction of pBSK/GetJA4withNdeI and EcoRI and cloned into pET28b (None). Final plasmids were sequenced and transformed into E. coli Rosetta BL21 (DE3) pLysS/RARE for protein expression. Expression and Purification of the A-domains\u2014Purified A-domain pET28b (None) plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta BL21 (DE3) pLysS/RARE competent cells for protein production and purification. Fresh transformants harboring the constructs were grown in LB-medium (1-liter batches started with 0.1% inocula from a 10-ml culture grown for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C) supplemented with kanamycin (50 Noneg mlNone1) and chlor-amphenicol (34 Noneg mlNone1). All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C to an OD600 ofNone0.8. The cells were then induced with 1 M isopropyl-None-D-thiogalactopyranoside to an end concentration of 0.2 mM and then grown at 16 \u00b0C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) and resuspended in buffer A (20 mMTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mMNaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The cells were then lysed (2 passes at 700 p.s.i., French press, SLM Aminco), and the cell debris was removed by cen-trifugation (21,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C). Prepacked HisTrapTM HP columnswere used for preparative purification of histidine-tagged recombinant proteins by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography on the A\u0308kta primeTMplus system (GEHealth-care). 15-ml protein lysates were filtered through a sterile filter and loaded onto the 1-ml HisTrap column. Purification was performed as recommended in theGEHealthcaremanual (His-TrapHP, Instructions 71-5027-68AF). The desired proteinwas eluted from the column in a stepwise imidazole gradient with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mMNaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol and 60, 100, 200, 300, and 500 mM imidazole, 10-ml fractions). Fractions containing the pure target protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were combined and concentrated to None200 Nonel by using Amicon Ultra PL-10 centricons. Then 800 Nonel of storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mMNaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) was added to the concentrated protein before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at None80 \u00b0C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 1\u20133 mg/ml purified protein were obtained for each protein per liter of culture. Determination of Substrate Specificity by ATP-[32P]PPi Exchange Assay\u2014To determine substrate specificity, ATP-[32P]PPi reactions (100 Nonel) containing Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 75 mM), MgCl2 (10 mM), dATP (5 mM), amino acid (5 mM), and protein (2 Noneg) were performed at 30 \u00b0C. 32P-Labeled tetraso-dium pyrophosphate was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sci-ences (NEN #NEX019). The reactions were started by the addi-tion of [32P]PPi (0.1 NoneCi final amount) for up to 30 min before quenching with charcoal suspensions (500 Nonel, 1.6% (w/v) acti-vated charcoal, 0.1 M Na4P2O7, and 0.35 M perchloric acid in H2O). The charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation before being washed twice with the wash solution (500 Nonel, 0.1 M Na4P2O7, and 0.35 M perchloric acid in H2O), resuspended in H2O (500 Nonel), and counted by liquid scintillation (Beckman LS6500). The experiments were carried out in triplicate for each substrate concentration with a negative control (no amino acid). Chemical Analyses\u2014GE81112 was purified and hydrolyzed as described by Brandi et al. (5). Dehalogenation of GE81112 was carried out under H2 at atmospheric pressure and room temperature in 10% acetic acid, with 10% palladium/carbon as GE81112 Biosynthetic Gene Cluster 32712 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285 \u2022 NUMBER 43 \u2022 OCTOBER 22, 2010 catalyst. Catalytic hydrogenation of hydroxypicolinic acid was performed under H2 atmosphere (50 p.s.i.) at room tempera-ture in aqueous NH4OH with 10% palladium/carbon as a cata-lyst. Dihydroxylation of allylglycine was performed following published procedures (18). A sample of (2R,3R)-3-hydroxy-pipecolic acid was kindly provided from Prof. Jieping Zhu (CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Chiral GC-MS analyses were performed on the methyl esters, and trifluoroacetyl derivatives were analyzed using a FinniganTSQ700 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer interfaced with a Varian 3400 gas chro-matographer (5). NMR and [None]D literature data for 3-hydroxy-histidine were obtained from (19). Homonuclear 1H and het-eronuclear 13C,1H NMR experiments were recorded at 400 MHz on a Bruker Advance spectrometer in D2O or in D2O acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). RESULTS Isolation of the GE81112 Biosynthetic Gene Cluster\u2014To cap-ture the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster (get, for GE81112 tetrapeptide) a cosmid library containing 2304 clones was generated from the genomic DNA of the GE81112 producer strain (Streptomyces sp. L-49973). Hybridization probes were designed by applying a retrobiosynthetic strategy that allowed us to predict some probable genetic elements of the get cluster from analysis of the metabolite structures (Fig. 1). On this basis we designed a set of probes using degenerate primers based on A-domains of streptomycete origin using the CODEHOP soft-ware (20); priming was targeted against the core A3 and A6 motifs. Furthermore, from the structure of 1 we predicted that the starter unit likely involves pipecolic acid, which is known to be formed from lysine via the action of a lysine cyclodeaminase (21). As cyclodeaminase genes are relatively rare in bacterial genomes, this gene was used to design a second probe to iden-tify the get cluster (22). We designed specific probes based on a cyclodeaminase sequence that was identified in previous exper-iments in the same strain.3 Colony hybridization of the Strep-tomyces sp. L-49973 cosmid library with the cyclodeaminase probe led to the identification of 7 cosmid hits. The cosmids were then determined to contain the targeted cyclodeaminase sequence by PCR. As we expected NRPSs to be encoded by the identified cosmids, we used the degenerate NRPS primers to amplify and sequence A-domain segments from these cosmids. Sequence analysis and prediction of the A-domain substrate specificity revealed one cosmid (BI11) containing an A-domain with predicted substrate specificity for proline/pipecolic acid, as expected for the GE81112 starter unit (Table 1). Subsequent, complete sequencing of the cosmid revealed several genes expected for GE81112 biosynthesis. As the entire gene cluster was not present on the cosmid, we identified overlapping cos-mids. In total, seven cosmids were identified, and after verifica-tion by PCR and restriction analysis, a single one (BA23) was selected for further analysis. Sequence Analysis and Organization of the get Biosynthetic Gene Cluster\u2014The two overlapping cosmids, BI11 and BA23, were sequenced. The obtained sequence was analyzed for the presence of putative open reading frames (orfs) with FramePlot 4.Obeta (23), and preliminary functional assignments of indi-vidual orfsweremade by comparison of the deduced gene prod-ucts with proteins of known function in the BLAST data base (Table 2). Annotation of the two cosmids (BI11 and BA23) revealed 29 orfs, of which 14, designated getA-N, are postulated to be involved in the GE81112 biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 2A). The first gene predicted to be involved is getA, as the proteins encoded by the orfs upstream of getA show no homology to proteins involved in biosynthetic pathways. getA (852 bp) encodes a type II thioesterase. Type II thioesterases are present in many NRPS and polyketide synthase systems, where they perform crucial proofreading functions by hydrolyzing aber-rant substrates from the respective carrier protein domains (24). getA is found within an operon that also harbors the genes getB-E. getB and getC encode proteins having homology to known ABC transporter systems (25). The next gene, getD, encodes the cyclodeaminase that was targeted in our library-probing strategy. It shows 52% identity to TubZ, the cyclo-deaminase from Angiococcus disciformis (14). The first gene encoding a NRPS protein (a freestanding A-domain) is getE, which likely starts with a GTG and is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site (GGAG) 7 bp upstream of the start codon. The next gene, getF, is oriented in the opposite direction and encodes a protein with homology to a putative L-(2S)-pro-line 3-hydroxylase. The following gene, getG (7212 bp), encodes another NRPS and is the likely starting point of a new operon which includes getH and getI. getH (1614 bp) encodes a di-do-main NRPS (PCP-C) enzyme and again starts with a GTG, whereas getI exhibits homology to an oxygenase. The last seg-ment of the cluster contains 5 genes (getJ-getN) and starts with another change in the transcription direction. It begins with getJ (2460 bp), which encodes a NRPS di-domain (A-PCP) enzyme. The next two genes, getK and getL, encode a GTPase protein and a halogenase, respectively. The NRPS-di-domain (A-PCP) encoding gene getM (1848 bp) is assumed to start with a TTG, with a ribosome binding site (AGGG) located 6 bp upstream. The last gene getN encodes a protein with homology to a type I thioesterase. The involvement of orfs 1\u20135 and 6\u201315 in GE81112 biosynthesis is unlikely but cannot yet be excluded. Further experiments will be carried out in the future to deter-mine the exact boundaries of the gene cluster. Analysis of NRPS Domains\u2014For the seven orfs with homol-ogy to NRPS genes (Fig. 3A), the constituent domains were assigned using the polyketide synthase/NRPS predictor (PKS Analysis Web site) and confirmed by manual inspection with3 T.

To incorporate four amino acids into GE81112, the synthetases were expected to contain a loading module fol-lowed by three condensation modules with the standard C-A-PCP arrangement. Furthermore, the simplest model predicts that the four amino acid precursors would be incorporated in a co-linear manner: pipecolic acid-ornithine/glutamine/glu-tamic acid-histidine-histidine. However, the get NRPS genes exhibit a non-co-linear arrangement that did not fit our expected model (Fig. 3A). Although the domain complement necessary for the biosynthesis of a tetrapeptide could be iden-tified, one extra A-PCP di-domain was present. Moreover, the NRPS modules show a highly split arrangement, as they occurred as freestanding domains (GetE) or di-domain units (GetH, GetJ, GetM) (Fig. 3A). Thus, from the domain assign-ment alone, the overall order of subunits could not be dis-cerned. To determine the substrate specificity of the A-do-mains, the specificity-conferring code and eight conserved motifs were identified for each A-domain, and bioinformatic analysis was employed to predict their substrate specificities (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2) (26, 27). The first A-domain (GetEA1), encoded by getE as a discrete protein, was a candidate for starter unit selection as its predicted specificity was for the incorporation of proline/pipecolic acid (Table 1). The second A-domain (GetGA2) showed homology to ornithine/gluta-mine/asparagine-incorporating A-domains. The third A-do-main (GetGA3) was predicted to be specific for the incorpora-tion of tyrosine/tryptophan and the two latter domains GetJA4 and GetMA5 for histidine (Table 1). These results correlated well with the prediction that an ornithine and two histidines are incorporated into the GE81112 metabolites. However, it remained unclear why twoA-PCP di-domains (GetM andGetJ) are encoded by the cluster, as only one is required to give a full complement of four active modules. To check if any of the domains were inactive, the C-and PCP-domains were analyzed as well. The get cluster encodes three C-domains that aligned well with the C-domains from the rapamycin-, the gramicidin-, and the calcium-dependent antibiotic biosynthetic clusters (28\u201330).

These results demonstrate that, in principle, all of the NRPS domains are active. Furthermore we annotated two discrete thio-esterases (encoded by getA and getN), both containing the con-served motif GXSXG, present in functional enzymes (16). BLAST analysis (Table 2) revealed that the protein GetA is more related to type II thioesterases, whereas GetN is more related to type I thioesterases. This finding was surprising, as GetN is a discrete protein (like a type II thioesterase) not integrated into an NRPS-like type I thioesterase typically found in bacterial systems. FIGURE 2. Organization of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. L-49973. A, a sche-Confirmation of the Role of the get Cluster by Gene Inactivation\u2014To verify the identity of the proposed GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster, we inactivated getE, which encodes a free-standing A-domain. For this, a knock-out construct was designed by amplifying an internal fragment, which was then cloned into the knock-out vector pKC1132 (10). Initial attempts to transform Streptomyces sp. L-49973 with the knock-out plasmid were unsuccessful, necessitating the devel-opment of an adapted transformation method. Only by using a larger ratio of E. coli cells (5 None 1010) to 5 None 107 recipient cells were we able to obtain several exconjugants containing the knock-out vector, indicating that the number of donor cells is crucial for the conjugation efficiency with this strain (31). The resultant mutants were verified by PCR against the apramy-cin resistance gene as well as an internal region from the genomic DNA. The mutants were then cultivated in produc-tion medium, and the extracts were analyzed for the pres-ence of the GE81112 compounds by high resolution MS. This analysis clearly showed that GE81112 production was abolished in the mutants, confirming the role of the cloned gene cluster (Fig. 2B). Biochemical Analysis of Adenylation Domains\u2014To obtain experimental evidence for A-domain substrate specificity, we expressed the five get A-domains as N-terminal His6-tagged proteins. DNA fragments coding for the adenylation domains of getE (1 domain, GetEA1, size 60.39 kDa), getG (2 domains, GetGA2 and GetGA3, sizes 61.50 and 63.13 kDa), getJ (1 domain, GetJA4, size 60.0 kDa), and getM (1 domain, GetMA5, size 63.40 kDa) were amplified from cosmids BI11 or BA23 and cloned into pET28b (None) vectors. The constructs were con-firmed by sequencing and transformed intoE. coli RosettaBL21 (DE3) pLysS/RARE. Cultivation was carried out at 16 \u00b0C. Expression was induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-None-D-thiogalac-topyranoside atA600 None 0.8\u20131. All proteins could be obtained in the soluble fraction and were used for the ATP-PPi exchange assay after purification. The substrate specificity of the five purified adenylation domains was evaluated using the established ATP-PPi exchange assay (32, 33). Briefly, each protein was incubated with a panel of different amino acids, including the anticipated substrate of each A-domain. As a control, each protein was incubated in the absence of added amino acid. The results as shown in Fig. 4, A\u2013E, indicate that GetEA1 activated L-(2S)-Pip (100%), D-(2R)-Pip (82.9%). and L-(2S)-Pro (80.3%). The back-ground controls were between 0.85 and 3.79%, confirming that the measured activity reflected the true substrate preference of the A-domain. GetGA2 activated L-(2S)-ornithine (100%) as well as L-(2S)-Gln (62.7%) preferentially, whereas L-(2S)-Glu and L-(2S)-Asp were activated to a minor extent. GetGA3, GetJA4, and GetMA5 all activated L-(2S)-His (100%) as well as L-(2S)-Lys to a minor extent (between 41 and 53%). So a clear preference for L-(2S)-His could be verified for all the three pro-teins. Taken together, these results establish that the five pro-teins exhibit the enzymatic activity of adenylation domains and show preference for substrates consistent with the GE81112 structure. Stereoconfiguration of Chiral Centers\u2014Before this work, the stereochemistry of the chiral centers in GE81112 was not FIGURE 4. Relative substrate specificities of internal adenylation known. The chemical analyses described here have confirmed the indication from theATP-PPi exchange assays that all amino acids have the (2S)-configuration and provided preliminary evi-dence about the other stereocenters. NMR analyses of GE81112 dissolved in DMSO-d6 (5) do not provide useful information about the relative stereochemistry due to generally broad signals. Improved resolution and shape of the signals were achieved using D2O (as such and acidified with TFA), allowing new assignments (Table 3). Under these conditions, the signal belonging to the None-hydrogen of chloro-histidine (5.20 ppm) shows a vicinal coupling constant J of 3Hz, suggesting a threo relative stereochemistry according to litera-ture data available for 3-hydroxy-His (19), whereas the opposite stereochemistry is expected to have a J of 6 Hz (34). Analogous indications about the 3-hydroxypipecolic acid residue were not achieved due to partially overlapping signals not allowing a sat-isfactory J resolution. Further experiments were, thus, neces-sary to determine the relative and absolute stereochemistry of GE81112. The first three amino acids were investigated by chiral GC-MS of acid-hydrolyzed congener A (data not shown). The first amino acid did notmatch (2R,3R)-3-hydroxypipecolic acid or any of the (2S,3R) and (2R,3S) cis-diastereomers, easily obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of 3-hydroxy-picolinic acid. We, thus, assume the first amino acid has the (2S,3S) ste-reochemistry. For the second amino acid, protected L-allylgly-cinewas dihydroxylated to (2S)-2-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-penta-noic acid, yielding a mixture of the two diastereomers in the None position. The same procedure, performed on racemic allylgly-cine, provided standards of the remaining two (2R)-diaste-reomers. Based on the chiral analysis of the second amino acid, the configuration of the None-carbon is assumed to be (S), and based on the published facial diastereoselection of dihydroxy-lation (18), the None-stereocenter should be (S). The third amino acid matched (2S)-His by comparison with commercial (S) and (R) standards. For the fourth amino acid, GE81112 was hydrogenated to its dechloro analog, affording 3-hydroxyhistidine upon acid hydrolysis. Comparison of NMR and [None]D data with literature values were consistent with the (2S,3S) configuration for the fourth amino acid (data not shown), in agreement with the threo relative stereochemistry suggested by the NMR experiments in D2O. These results together with the lack of epimerization domains (or dual condensation/epimerization domains), thus, strongly suggest that GE81112 is a tetrapeptide made of L-amino acids (2S configuration) only and suggest the stereo-chemistry of the other centers as shown for congenerA in Fig. 1. DISCUSSION Many antibiotics target the prokaryotic translational appara-tus, but few selectively inhibit initiation. Protein translation in prokaryotes is initiated by the binding of fMet-tRNA to the ribosomal P-site. Recently, the GE81112 tetrapeptides were shown to specifically inhibit this fMet-tRNA binding by block-ing the P-site and, thus, represent a unique class of inhibitors with a newmode of action (35). Identification and biochemical characterization of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster now provide insights into the biosynthesis of this unique family of secondary metabolites and sets the stage for the generation of new derivatives by genetic engineering. The identity of the cloned gene cluster was confirmed by inactivation of getE, which completely abolished GE81112 production. Although many of the enzymes encoded by the get cluster are consistent with GE81112 biosynthesis, the NRPSs are present with a highly split, non-co linear module arrangement (Fig. 3A). Unusual features include two freestanding A-PCP di-domains (encoded by getJ and getM) and a stand-alone A-domain (encoded by gene getE). Stand-alone A-domains have been identified in other nonlinear NRPS pathways, e.g. myxochelin (36) and yersiniabactin (37), whereas free-standing A-PCP di-domains are found in the zorbamycin and syringomycin gene clusters (38, 39). According to bioinformatic analysis, all NRPS domains are predicted to be functional (supplemental Fig. S2 and S3). Furthermore, because the get cluster encodes five dis-tinct A and PCP domains instead of the four predicted for a tetrapeptide, the order of subunits (and corresponding mod-ules) could not be predicted from sequence alone. The estab-lished specificity for the five A-domains and analysis of the functions predicted from the other enzymes encoded by the cluster allow us to draw a first model for GE81112 formation (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, the biosynthesis of GE81112 starts with the for-mation of (2S)-pipecolic acid from (2S)-lysine via the action of the putative cyclodeaminase GetD (Fig. 3C). Pipecolic acid is directly activated by the A-domain GetEA1 and then loaded onto the adjacent PCP domain. Consistently, an ATP-PPi exchange assay confirmed that GetEA1 preferentially recog-nizes (2S)-pipecolic acid (Fig. 4A). However, the pipecolic acid moiety in GE81112 is hydroxylated at the None-position. There is precedent for None-hydroxylation to occur at three different stag-es; on the free amino acid (40), whereas the amino acid is teth-ered to the PCP (41), or on themature peptide after thioesterase hydrolysis from the NRPS (42, 43). As GetEA1 could not be directly assayed with hydroxypipecolate due to the commercial TABLE 3 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift assignments of GE8112 congener A in D2O at 298 K The assignments were made by analysis of COSY, TOCSY (two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy), HMQC (heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence), and HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond coherence) spectra. Numbering is according to previous work (5).

GE81112 Biosynthetic Gene Cluster OCTOBER 22, 2010 \u2022 VOLUME 285 \u2022 NUMBER 43 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 32717 unavailability of this compound, we suggest that this domain might also recognize hydroxypipecolic acid. In any case, the presence of the 3-hydroxyl group on the pipecolate moiety is essential for activity, as GE81112 derivatives lacking this group are 3 orders of magnitude less active in the translation assay than the parent compounds.4 It was not obvious from which amino acid the second build-ing block is derived. ForGE81112 congenersA (1) andB (2), the second amino acid residue is 5-hydroxy-2-aminopentanoic acid (O-HPA), which is hydroxylated at position 4 and O-car-bamoylated at position 5, whereas congener B1 (3) contains a hydroxylated and carbamoylated ornithine residue (Fig. 1). We hypothesize that the A-domain GetGA2 is responsible for the incorporation of the second amino acid in GE81112. A recent example in the biosynthesis of the nucleoside antibiotic polyoxin shows that O-carbamoyl-polyhydroxypentanoic acid is generated from free (2S)-glutamate by stepwise reduction, O-carbamoylation, and hydroxylations (44). The complete building block is then attached to the nucleoside. Similarly, GE81112 congeners A and B could derive from activation of the O-HPA substrate (or of a precursor) by the A-domain GetGA2 and loading on the corresponding PCP (Fig. 3C). However, we could not identify candidate genes in the get cluster forO-HPA biosynthesis, so they may be encoded elsewhere in the genome (45, 46). According to our hypothesis, the A-domain GetGA2 must show a broad substrate acceptance, activating O-HPA-and ornithine-based amino acids to generate the different GE81112 congeners. As O-HPA or any derivatives were not commercially available, we tested the likely precursors of O-HPA, (2S)-glutamic acid and (2S)-glutamine in addition to (2S)-ornithine. Activation of all the three amino acids (orni-thine,Glu, andGln)was observed (Fig. 4B) with a preference for (2S)-ornithine. The reduced degree of activation of glutamic acid and glutamine may indicate that modified versions of glu-tamic acid and glutamine are preferred, consistent with the hypothesis that O-HPA is formed before loading to the PCP. It should be noted that themajor congeners of theGE81112 com-plex produced by Streptomyces S. sp. L-49973 are A and B,5 indicating that in vivo O-HPA or a precursor is the preferred substrate for the NRPS. The third amino acid incorporated into theGE81112 peptide is either histidine (1) or aminohistidine (2 and 3). In silico anal-ysis of GetGA3 predicts specificity for tyrosine or tryptophan rather than histidine. This prediction may indicate a general preference of the A-domain for aromatic amino acid residues, which might account for activation of both histidine and ami-nohistidine. However, it is not clear how the aminohistidine moiety is generated: \u201camination\u201d might occur at the PCP-bound histidine after release of the peptide from the NRPS, or alternatively, aminohistidine could derive from the cyclization of arginine by nucleophilic attack of the None-carbon. According to the ATP-PPi exchange assay, histidine is the preferred sub-strate, and no activation was observed with arginine, trypto-phan, or tyrosine (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that aminohisti-dine is not generated from PCP-bound arginine, tryptophan, or tyrosine, but we could not establish whether GetGA3 also rec-ognizes aminohistidine, as this amino acid is not commercially available. Thus, the nature and timing of histidine amination remains unclear. A 3-hydroxy-6-chlorohistidine is the last amino acid to be incorporated in GE81112. Halogenation is a common modifi-cation found in bioactive natural products (47\u201349), and the timing of halogenation reactions has been shown to vary. For example, in rebeccamycin, pre-assembly line chlorination of tryptophan occurs (50), whereas a PCP-bound threonine is chlorinated for syringomycin (51). The putative halogenase GetL is the likely candidate for histidine chlorination in GE81112. GetI shows homology to non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases/hydroxylases and is, therefore, assumed to hydrox-ylate histidine at the None-position. Figs. 3, B and C, illustrate the proposed mechanism for the chlorination/hydroxylation of histidine and its incorporation into GE81112. As there is evi-dence from sequence analysis and in vitro experiments (supple-mental Fig. S2 and Fig. 4E) that the A-PCP domains of the seemingly superfluous GetM protein are active, this di-domain may play a role in the biosynthesis of the fourth amino acid precursor. Indeed, there are a number of examples in which specialized A-PCP di-domains are essential for generating NRPS precursors (52\u201356). Here, we propose that theA-domain GetMA5 activates (2S)-histidine, consistent with the results of the ATP-PPi exchange assay, and tethers it to the PCP of GetM. Hydroxylation and/or halogenation reactions then occur on the PCP-bound amino acid as catalyzed by GetI and GetL, respec-tively (Fig. 3B). The thioesterase GetA would then release the modified amino acid, as described for BarC from the barbamide biosynthetic pathway (53). In the subsequent step, the free, modified histidine is activated by the A-domain GetJA4 and loaded onto the PCP ofmodule 4 (Fig. 3C). This is supported by the ATP-PPi exchange assay showing that GetJA4 has specific-ity for (2S)-histidine (Fig. 4D). Again, the relative timing of chlorination and hydroxylation is unclear, as it is conceivable that one of these reactions may occur on the GetJ-tethered amino acid or peptide. In Fig. 3C, GetA is predicted to function as a type II thioesterase to release themodified amino acid from GetM. Alternatively, GetA could act as an aminoacyltrans-ferase, shuttling the PCP-boundmodified histidine fromGetM to GetJ. There are several examples of such PCP-to-PCP shut-tling reactions (38, 55), and the aminoacyltransferases identi-fied to date have been assigned into two groups (38); one group, comprising SyrC, CmaE, and ZmbVIId, contains a GXCXG motif at the active site, and these enzymes are predicted to act as acyltransferases, with the active-site cysteine shown to be directly involved in aminoacyl transfer (52); the second group includes the acyltransferases BarC (53) and CouN7 (54), with an active site serine in the GXSXG motif, and are predicted to function as ordinary thioesterases. GetA and GetN both con-tain active site serines, which suggest that they both function as normal thioesterases and not as aminoacyltransferases (supple-mental Fig. S4). GetN is expected to catalyze the release of the peptide from the assembly line (Fig. 3C). The combination of genetic, biochemical, and chemical anal-yses demonstrate that GE81112 is composed of L-amino acids only. This result is consistent with the observation that it is a 4 S. I.

        "The GE81112 tetrapeptides (1\u20133) represent a structurally unique class of antibiotics, acting as specific inhibitors of pro-karyotic protein synthesis. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. L-49973 and the development of a genetic manipulation system for Streptomyces sp. L-49973. The biosyn-thetic gene cluster for the tetrapeptide antibiotic GE81112 (getA-N) was identified within a 61.7-kb region comprising 29 open reading frames (open reading frames), 14 of which were assigned to the biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis re-vealed the GE81112 cluster to consist of six nonribosomal pep-tide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding incomplete di-domain NRPS modules and a single free standing NRPS domain as well as genes encoding other biosynthetic and modifying proteins. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in GE81112 biosyn-thesis was confirmed by inactivating the NRPS gene getE result-ing in a GE81112 production abolished mutant. In addition, we characterized the NRPS A-domains from the pathway by expression inEscherichia coli and in vitro enzymatic assays. The previously unknown stereochemistry of most chiral centers in GE81112 was established from a combined chemical and bio-synthetic approach.Taken together, these findings have allowed us to propose a rational model for GE81112 biosynthesis. The results further open the door to developing new derivatives of these promising antibiotic compounds by genetic engineering.",
        "The emergence of multi-drug resistant microbial pathogens is driving the search for novel antibiotics with newmechanisms of action and natural products continue to provide original scaffolds affecting essential bacterial targets (1, 2). As it is cur-rently understood, most antibiotics act in three basic ways; 1) inhibition of DNA replication and repair, 2) inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis, and 3) inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Pro-tein translation and cell wall biosynthesis in bacteria are cur-rently the targets for the majority of antimicrobial natural products. The former is the target of the macrolides (e.g. eryth-romycin), the aminoglycosides (e.g. kanamycin), the strepto-gramins, the lincosamides, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol as well as of other classes of compounds that are not in clinical use. These compounds have been shown to affect protein bio-synthesis at various steps (3, 4).",
        "Some aspects of protein translation are rarely targeted, e.g. translation initiation andpolypeptide chain termination.Amicro-bial product screening program aimed at discovering novel inhib-itors of bacterial protein synthesis revealed the new tetrapeptide GE81112compounds (1-3) (Fig. 1) to selectively inhibit the forma-tion of the prokaryotic 30 S initiation complex with an IC50 None 0.9 NoneM (5). Todate, threeGE81112 congeners, A (1), B (2), andB1 (3), have been described from a Streptomyces sp. (Fig. 1). Extensive NMR and MS studies revealed the tetrapeptides to comprise hydroxypipecolic and hydroxypentanoic acids, an (amino)histi-dine, and a hydroxychlorohistidine (5). A retro-biosynthetic anal-ysis of the GE81112 core structure suggests a NRPS2 origin with additional tailoringstepsoccurringat somepointduringassembly. NRPSmultienzymes are composed of successive catalytic units or \u201cdomains\u201d that are themselves organized into biosynthetic mod-ules which catalyze the assembly reactions in a coordinated, often \u201cco-linear\u201d manner. Normally, each module in the assembly line performs one cycle of chain extension (condensation of one resi-due into the growing peptide chain). A typical, minimal NRPS module consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)domain (also referred to as a thiolation (T)domain), and a condensation (C) domain (6). However, a growing number of gene clusters encode systems that deviate in their domain orga-nization from the standard C-A-PCP architecture and comprise partialmodulesor isolateddomainsacting in trans to complement the functionality of the multimodular NRPSs (7\u20139).",
        "To better understand GE81112 biosynthesis and to generate structural analogues, we sought to develop a strategy for the clon-ing and identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster. To this end, the clusterwas identifiedon twooverlapping cosmids. In addition, weexpressed fiveA-domains fromthecorrespondingNRPSgenes and characterized them in vitro. These results together with the assignment of the configuration of most chiral centers have",

        "Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions\u2014Streptomyces sp. L-49973 was grown in INA5 (glycerol, 30 g literNone1; soya extract, 15 g literNone1; CaCO3, 5 g literNone1; NaCl, 2 g literNone1) or T6 (glyc-erol, 45 g literNone1; soya extract, 25 g literNone1; CaCO3, 2 g literNone1) media in baffled flasks for production of GE81112. Pre-cultures were grown in V6 medium (glucose, 20 g literNone1; meat extract, 5 g literNone1; yeast extract, 5 g literNone1; peptone 5 g literNone1; caseine, 3 g literNone1; NaCl, 1.5 g literNone1, pH 7.5) and used to inoculate production culture (1:100). The cultures were maintained at 30 \u00b0C and 180 rpm on a rotary incubator and harvested after 6 days. Escherichia coli DH10B, E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002, and E. coli SURE were grown in liquid LB medium at 37 or 30 \u00b0C with the appropriate antibiotic selection. Antibiotic concentra-tions were as follows; apramycin (60 Noneg mlNone1), chlorampheni-col (34 Noneg mlNone1), kanamycin (60 Noneg/mlNone1), and ampicillin (100 Noneg mlNone1) were used for selection in E. coli. Apramycin (60 Noneg mlNone1) was used for selection of Streptomyces sp. L-49973 recombinants. Nalidixic acid (25 Nonel mlNone1) was used to select against E. coli donor after conjugation.",
        "Molecular Biology Methods\u2014The pET28b (None) (Novagen) and pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) cloning vectors were from commercial sources; pKC1132 and pOJ436were described pre-viously (10). Restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas. All PCRs were carried out using Taq (MBI Fermen-tas) or Phusion (Invitrogen) polymerase. DMSO was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 5%. Conditions for amplification with a Peqlab ThermoCycler were as follows: denaturation, 15\u201330 s at 95/98 \u00b0C; annealing, 8\u201320 s at 50\u201362 \u00b0C; extension, 15\u201360 s at 72 \u00b0C (30 cycles); final exten-sion at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the GeneJETTM Plas-mid Miniprep kit (Fermentas). DNA fragments from agarose gel were isolated and purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel). All other DNA manipulations in E. coli (11) and Streptomyces (10) were carried out using standard pro-tocols. For colony hybridization analysis, digoxigenin labeling of DNA probes, hybridization, and detection were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Roche Diagnostics).",
        "Construction of a Streptomyces sp. L-49973 Genomic Cosmid Library\u2014A Streptomyces sp. L-49973 genomic cosmid library was constructed in E. coli SURE. Genomic DNA was isolated with the salting out procedure (10). Then theDNAwas partially digested with Sau3A, yielding fragments with an average size greater than 35 kb. The fragments were ligated into cosmid vector pOJ436 (12) digested with BamHI and PvuII and in vitro packaged with the Gigapack III Gold packaging extract kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s handbook (Stratagene). 2304 colonies were transferred into six 384-well microtiter plates using a Qbot robot (Genetix) and grown overnight in 2YT medium. For storage at None80 \u00b0C, 50 Nonel of freezing solution (0.076% MgSO4None7 H2O, 0.45% sodium citrateNone2 H2O, 0.9% NH4SO4, 44% glycerol, 4.7% K2HPO4, 1.8% KH2PO4) was added to each well. Robotically produced high density colony arrays (Hybond NNone, Amersham Biosciences) were utilized for the screening of the cosmid clones, as described previously (13).",
        "Screening of a Streptomyces sp. L-49973 Genomic Cosmid Library\u2014Cyclodeaminase and NRPS fragment sequences were initially used as probes under low stringency conditions. To create the cyclodeaminase probe, we used specific primers to amplify two known cyclodeaminase genes, tubZ (14) (primers Tubz_up and TubZ_down, 570-bp product)m from the tubuly-sin cluster, and rapL (15), from the rapamycin cluster (primers RapL_up and RapL_down, 534-bp PCR product) (see the prim-ers in supplemental Table S1). As an alternative approach, we designed an additional probe to identify NRPS genes. For this, we used degenerate NRPS primers; NRPS-A1-up and NRPS-H1-dn (supplemental Table S1). These primers amplify A-do-mains between the structural regionsA3 andA6 (16), where the amino acid binding pocket is located, giving a 760-bp PCR frag-ment. The ampliconswere labeledwith digoxigenin and used to probe the cosmid library at low stringency (40 \u00b0C). Several cos-mids that hybridized with both probes were subjected to PCR analysis for the amplification of the cyclodeaminase and NRPS A-domains. In the first screeningwe identified a cosmid encod-ing a putative cyclodeaminase but not the expected GE81112 biosynthetic enzymes. A segment of this cyclodeaminase was amplified using the primers Cyclo_probe_for and Cyclo_probe_ rev (supplemental Table S1) and used under high stringency conditions (42 \u00b0C) for further screening of the library. Cosmids hybridizing with this probe were analyzed by PCR using prim-ers to amplify the cyclodeaminase and NRPS A-domains again. The resulting PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector and sequenced. Several NRPS sequences were found from different cosmids, and the eight critical residues responsible for substrate recognition could be determined enabling an in silico prediction of the substrate specificity of each cloned A-domain fragment. Cosmids har-boringA-domains thatwere predicted to activate pipecolic acid were digested with BamHI, and the restriction pattern was compared with identify similar cosmids. End sequencing of the cosmids was carried out using primers T4 and T7 (supplemen-tal Table S1). One cosmid (BI11) was identified containing a large part of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster. To find a cosmid that overlapped with the 3None (T7) end of the cluster, a 1-kb fragment was amplified from the T7 end of cosmid BI11 (primers BI11-T7end-for and BI11-T7end-rev, supplemental Table S1) to serve as a probe. The cosmid library was then screened with the new probe, with hybridization at 42 \u00b0C. Among the identified cosmids, BA23 showed the smallest extent of overlap with BI11 based on PCR analysis and restric-tion digest. Cosmids BI11 and BA23 were shotgun-sequenced on both strands as described previously (17).",
        "Data Analysis\u2014The annotation analysis of the sequence data was performed through FramePlot analysis (FramePlot 4.Obeta) (23) and data base comparison with the basic align-ment search tool (BLAST) on the server of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. For alignment analysis of the sequence data, ClustalW on the server of EMBL-EBI was used. Specificity of the A-domains was determined by using the NRPS predictor Bioinformatics Toolbox from University of Tu\u0308bingen and polyketide synthase/NRPS analysis web site.",

        "Conjugation andGeneration ofMutant Strains of Streptomy-ces sp. L-49973\u2014DNA manipulation was carried out with E. coli DH10B as the host strain. To generate knock-out mutants by means of insert-directed homologous recombina-tion, a 572-bp internal fragment of gene getEwas amplifiedwith primers pipA_for and pipA_rev (supplemental Table S1). The fragments were cloned into pCR2.1TOPO, and the constructs were digested with EcoRI. The fragments were ligated into knock-out vector pKC1132 (10) digested with EcoRI. The final pKC1132-derived plasmids were introduced into Streptomyces sp. L-49973 by intergeneric conjugation with the methylation-deficient donor strain E. coli ET12567 containing the conjuga-tive vector pUZ8002 (10).Mutants were analyzed by PCR using appropriate control primers. One primer was designed to bind to the integrated vector backbone (lacZ1, lacZ2), whereas the second primer was designed to target the genome sequence either up-or downstream of the integration site (A1_for, A1_rev) (supplemental Table S1). PCR of the mutants yielded distinct amplicons, whereas no products were detected from the wild type.",
        "Analysis of GE81112 Production in Streptomyces sp. L-49973\u2014 Streptomyces strains (wild types and mutants) were cultured in 500-ml baffled shake flasks containing 100 ml of GE81112 pro-duction medium (INA5 or T6) at 30 \u00b0C and 180 rpm. Recombi-nant strains were amended with apramycin (60 Noneg mlNone1). A square of agar from a sporulating SM agar plate was used for inoculation. After 6 days of cultivation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5min. The culture supernatant was extracted two times with ethyl acetate, evaporated, and redissolved in 500 Nonel of methanol. LC-coupled FT-Orbit-rap-MS analysis was carried out with an Accella UPLC system (Thermo Electron Corp.) operating in positive ionizationmode at a scan range of m/z 100\u20132000. A Hypersil Gold column (2.1 None 50 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for separa-tion with a solvent system consisting of H2O (A) and acetoni-trile (B), each containing 0.1% formic acid. A gradient of 5\u201395% B was applied over 10 min. Measurements were carried out in single ion mode. GE81112 compounds were identified by com-parison to the retention times and the MS data of authentic standards (GE congener A: [MNoneH]None None 644.21858; GE conge-ner B: [MNoneH]None None 659.22953; GE congener B1: [MNoneH]None None 658.24587) in the positive ionization mode.",
        "Construction of A-domain Overexpression Constructs\u2014The genes encoding for the five A-domains (GetEA1, GetGA2, GetGA3, GetJA4, and GetMA5) of GE81112 were PCR-ampli-fied from cosmids BI11 and BA23. The forward and reverse primers for amplification of A-domain fragments getEA1, getGA2, getGA3, and getMA5 introduced NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (supplemental Table S1). A-domain fragment getJA4 could not be amplified from the cosmids, probably due to the highGC content. Therefore, theA-domain sequencewas synthesized, and theGCcontentwas optimized for use inE. coli (ATG::biosynthetics GmbH). The fragment was obtained in pBluescript SKNone (pBSK) vector flanked by restriction sites NdeI and EcoRI (supplemental Fig. S1). All PCR products were cloned into the digested pET28b (None) vector using the corre-sponding NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. Fragment getJA4 was obtained after restriction of pBSK/GetJA4withNdeI and EcoRI and cloned into pET28b (None). Final plasmids were sequenced and transformed into E. coli Rosetta BL21 (DE3) pLysS/RARE for protein expression.",
        "Expression and Purification of the A-domains\u2014Purified A-domain pET28b (None) plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta BL21 (DE3) pLysS/RARE competent cells for protein production and purification. Fresh transformants harboring the constructs were grown in LB-medium (1-liter batches started with 0.1% inocula from a 10-ml culture grown for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C) supplemented with kanamycin (50 Noneg mlNone1) and chlor-amphenicol (34 Noneg mlNone1). All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C to an OD600 ofNone0.8. The cells were then induced with 1 M isopropyl-None-D-thiogalactopyranoside to an end concentration of 0.2 mM and then grown at 16 \u00b0C overnight.

The cells were then lysed (2 passes at 700 p.s.i., French press, SLM Aminco), and the cell debris was removed by cen-trifugation (21,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C). Prepacked HisTrapTM HP columnswere used for preparative purification of histidine-tagged recombinant proteins by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography on the A\u0308kta primeTMplus system (GEHealth-care). 15-ml protein lysates were filtered through a sterile filter and loaded onto the 1-ml HisTrap column. Purification was performed as recommended in theGEHealthcaremanual (His-TrapHP, Instructions 71-5027-68AF). The desired proteinwas eluted from the column in a stepwise imidazole gradient with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mMNaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol and 60, 100, 200, 300, and 500 mM imidazole, 10-ml fractions).

Then 800 Nonel of storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mMNaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) was added to the concentrated protein before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at None80 \u00b0C.

        "Isolation of the GE81112 Biosynthetic Gene Cluster\u2014To cap-ture the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster (get, for GE81112 tetrapeptide) a cosmid library containing 2304 clones was generated from the genomic DNA of the GE81112 producer strain (Streptomyces sp. L-49973). Hybridization probes were designed by applying a retrobiosynthetic strategy that allowed us to predict some probable genetic elements of the get cluster from analysis of the metabolite structures (Fig. 1). On this basis we designed a set of probes using degenerate primers based on A-domains of streptomycete origin using the CODEHOP soft-ware (20); priming was targeted against the core A3 and A6 motifs. Furthermore, from the structure of 1 we predicted that the starter unit likely involves pipecolic acid, which is known to be formed from lysine via the action of a lysine cyclodeaminase (21). As cyclodeaminase genes are relatively rare in bacterial genomes, this gene was used to design a second probe to iden-tify the get cluster (22). We designed specific probes based on a cyclodeaminase sequence that was identified in previous exper-iments in the same strain.3 Colony hybridization of the Strep-tomyces sp. L-49973 cosmid library with the cyclodeaminase probe led to the identification of 7 cosmid hits. The cosmids were then determined to contain the targeted cyclodeaminase sequence by PCR. As we expected NRPSs to be encoded by the identified cosmids, we used the degenerate NRPS primers to amplify and sequence A-domain segments from these cosmids. Sequence analysis and prediction of the A-domain substrate specificity revealed one cosmid (BI11) containing an A-domain with predicted substrate specificity for proline/pipecolic acid, as expected for the GE81112 starter unit (Table 1). Subsequent, complete sequencing of the cosmid revealed several genes expected for GE81112 biosynthesis. As the entire gene cluster was not present on the cosmid, we identified overlapping cos-mids. In total, seven cosmids were identified, and after verifica-tion by PCR and restriction analysis, a single one (BA23) was selected for further analysis.",
        "Sequence Analysis and Organization of the get Biosynthetic Gene Cluster\u2014The two overlapping cosmids, BI11 and BA23, were sequenced. The obtained sequence was analyzed for the presence of putative open reading frames (orfs) with FramePlot 4.Obeta (23), and preliminary functional assignments of indi-vidual orfsweremade by comparison of the deduced gene prod-ucts with proteins of known function in the BLAST data base (Table 2). Annotation of the two cosmids (BI11 and BA23) revealed 29 orfs, of which 14, designated getA-N, are postulated to be involved in the GE81112 biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 2A). The first gene predicted to be involved is getA, as the proteins encoded by the orfs upstream of getA show no homology to proteins involved in biosynthetic pathways. getA (852 bp) encodes a type II thioesterase. Type II thioesterases are present in many NRPS and polyketide synthase systems, where they perform crucial proofreading functions by hydrolyzing aber-rant substrates from the respective carrier protein domains (24). getA is found within an operon that also harbors the genes getB-E. getB and getC encode proteins having homology to known ABC transporter systems (25). The next gene, getD, encodes the cyclodeaminase that was targeted in our library-probing strategy. It shows 52% identity to TubZ, the cyclo-deaminase from Angiococcus disciformis (14). The first gene encoding a NRPS protein (a freestanding A-domain) is getE, which likely starts with a GTG and is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site (GGAG) 7 bp upstream of the start codon. The next gene, getF, is oriented in the opposite direction and encodes a protein with homology to a putative L-(2S)-pro-line 3-hydroxylase. The following gene, getG (7212 bp), encodes another NRPS and is the likely starting point of a new operon which includes getH and getI. getH (1614 bp) encodes a di-do-main NRPS (PCP-C) enzyme and again starts with a GTG, whereas getI exhibits homology to an oxygenase. The last seg-ment of the cluster contains 5 genes (getJ-getN) and starts with another change in the transcription direction. It begins with getJ (2460 bp), which encodes a NRPS di-domain (A-PCP) enzyme. The next two genes, getK and getL, encode a GTPase protein and a halogenase, respectively. The NRPS-di-domain (A-PCP) encoding gene getM (1848 bp) is assumed to start with a TTG, with a ribosome binding site (AGGG) located 6 bp upstream. The last gene getN encodes a protein with homology to a type I thioesterase. The involvement of orfs 1\u20135 and 6\u201315 in GE81112 biosynthesis is unlikely but cannot yet be excluded. Further experiments will be carried out in the future to deter-mine the exact boundaries of the gene cluster.",
        "Analysis of NRPS Domains\u2014For the seven orfs with homol-ogy to NRPS genes (Fig. 3A), the constituent domains were assigned using the polyketide synthase/NRPS predictor (PKS Analysis Web site) and confirmed by manual inspection with3 T.

        "BLAST. To incorporate four amino acids into GE81112, the synthetases were expected to contain a loading module fol-lowed by three condensation modules with the standard C-A-PCP arrangement. Furthermore, the simplest model predicts that the four amino acid precursors would be incorporated in a co-linear manner: pipecolic acid-ornithine/glutamine/glu-tamic acid-histidine-histidine. However, the get NRPS genes exhibit a non-co-linear arrangement that did not fit our expected model (Fig. 3A). Although the domain complement necessary for the biosynthesis of a tetrapeptide could be iden-tified, one extra A-PCP di-domain was present. Moreover, the NRPS modules show a highly split arrangement, as they occurred as freestanding domains (GetE) or di-domain units (GetH, GetJ, GetM) (Fig. 3A). Thus, from the domain assign-ment alone, the overall order of subunits could not be dis-cerned. To determine the substrate specificity of the A-do-mains, the specificity-conferring code and eight conserved motifs were identified for each A-domain, and bioinformatic analysis was employed to predict their substrate specificities (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2) (26, 27). The first A-domain (GetEA1), encoded by getE as a discrete protein, was a candidate for starter unit selection as its predicted specificity was for the incorporation of proline/pipecolic acid (Table 1). The second A-domain (GetGA2) showed homology to ornithine/gluta-mine/asparagine-incorporating A-domains. The third A-do-main (GetGA3) was predicted to be specific for the incorpora-tion of tyrosine/tryptophan and the two latter domains GetJA4 and GetMA5 for histidine (Table 1). These results correlated well with the prediction that an ornithine and two histidines are incorporated into the GE81112 metabolites. However, it remained unclear why twoA-PCP di-domains (GetM andGetJ) are encoded by the cluster, as only one is required to give a full complement of four active modules. To check if any of the domains were inactive, the C-and PCP-domains were analyzed as well. The get cluster encodes three C-domains that aligned well with the C-domains from the rapamycin-, the gramicidin-, and the calcium-dependent antibiotic biosynthetic clusters (28\u201330).

        "Confirmation of the Role of the get Cluster by Gene Inactivation\u2014To verify the identity of the proposed GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster, we inactivated getE, which encodes a free-standing A-domain. For this, a knock-out construct was designed by amplifying an internal fragment, which was then cloned into the knock-out vector pKC1132 (10). Initial attempts to transform Streptomyces sp. L-49973 with the knock-out plasmid were unsuccessful, necessitating the devel-opment of an adapted transformation method. Only by using a larger ratio of E. coli cells (5 None 1010) to 5 None 107 recipient cells were we able to obtain several exconjugants containing the knock-out vector, indicating that the number of donor cells is crucial for the conjugation efficiency with this strain (31). The resultant mutants were verified by PCR against the apramy-cin resistance gene as well as an internal region from the genomic DNA. The mutants were then cultivated in produc-tion medium, and the extracts were analyzed for the pres-ence of the GE81112 compounds by high resolution MS. This analysis clearly showed that GE81112 production was abolished in the mutants, confirming the role of the cloned gene cluster (Fig. 2B).",
        "Biochemical Analysis of Adenylation Domains\u2014To obtain experimental evidence for A-domain substrate specificity, we expressed the five get A-domains as N-terminal His6-tagged proteins.

The constructs were con-firmed by sequencing and transformed intoE. coli RosettaBL21 (DE3) pLysS/RARE. Cultivation was carried out at 16 \u00b0C. Expression was induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-None-D-thiogalac-topyranoside atA600 None 0.8\u20131. All proteins could be obtained in the soluble fraction and were used for the ATP-PPi exchange assay after purification.",
        "The substrate specificity of the five purified adenylation domains was evaluated using the established ATP-PPi exchange assay (32, 33). Briefly, each protein was incubated with a panel of different amino acids, including the anticipated substrate of each A-domain. As a control, each protein was incubated in the absence of added amino acid. The results as shown in Fig. 4, A\u2013E, indicate that GetEA1 activated L-(2S)-Pip (100%), D-(2R)-Pip (82.9%). and L-(2S)-Pro (80.3%). The back-ground controls were between 0.85 and 3.79%, confirming that the measured activity reflected the true substrate preference of the A-domain. GetGA2 activated L-(2S)-ornithine (100%) as well as L-(2S)-Gln (62.7%) preferentially, whereas L-(2S)-Glu and L-(2S)-Asp were activated to a minor extent. GetGA3, GetJA4, and GetMA5 all activated L-(2S)-His (100%) as well as L-(2S)-Lys to a minor extent (between 41 and 53%). So a clear preference for L-(2S)-His could be verified for all the three pro-teins. Taken together, these results establish that the five pro-teins exhibit the enzymatic activity of adenylation domains and show preference for substrates consistent with the GE81112 structure.",

Improved resolution and shape of the signals were achieved using D2O (as such and acidified with TFA), allowing new assignments (Table 3). Under these conditions, the signal belonging to the None-hydrogen of chloro-histidine (5.20 ppm) shows a vicinal coupling constant J of 3Hz, suggesting a threo relative stereochemistry according to litera-ture data available for 3-hydroxy-His (19), whereas the opposite stereochemistry is expected to have a J of 6 Hz (34). Analogous indications about the 3-hydroxypipecolic acid residue were not achieved due to partially overlapping signals not allowing a sat-isfactory J resolution. Further experiments were, thus, neces-sary to determine the relative and absolute stereochemistry of GE81112.",
        "The first three amino acids were investigated by chiral GC-MS of acid-hydrolyzed congener A (data not shown). The first amino acid did notmatch (2R,3R)-3-hydroxypipecolic acid or any of the (2S,3R) and (2R,3S) cis-diastereomers, easily obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of 3-hydroxy-picolinic acid. We, thus, assume the first amino acid has the (2S,3S) ste-reochemistry. For the second amino acid, protected L-allylgly-cinewas dihydroxylated to (2S)-2-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-penta-noic acid, yielding a mixture of the two diastereomers in the None position. The same procedure, performed on racemic allylgly-cine, provided standards of the remaining two (2R)-diaste-reomers. Based on the chiral analysis of the second amino acid, the configuration of the None-carbon is assumed to be (S), and based on the published facial diastereoselection of dihydroxy-lation (18), the None-stereocenter should be (S).",
        "The third amino acid matched (2S)-His by comparison with commercial (S) and (R) standards. For the fourth amino acid, GE81112 was hydrogenated to its dechloro analog, affording 3-hydroxyhistidine upon acid hydrolysis. Comparison of NMR and [None]D data with literature values were consistent with the (2S,3S) configuration for the fourth amino acid (data not shown), in agreement with the threo relative stereochemistry suggested by the NMR experiments in D2O.",
        "These results together with the lack of epimerization domains (or dual condensation/epimerization domains), thus, strongly suggest that GE81112 is a tetrapeptide made of L-amino acids (2S configuration) only and suggest the stereo-chemistry of the other centers as shown for congenerA in Fig. 1.",
        "DISCUSSION",
        "Many antibiotics target the prokaryotic translational appara-tus, but few selectively inhibit initiation. Protein translation in prokaryotes is initiated by the binding of fMet-tRNA to the ribosomal P-site. Recently, the GE81112 tetrapeptides were shown to specifically inhibit this fMet-tRNA binding by block-ing the P-site and, thus, represent a unique class of inhibitors with a newmode of action (35). Identification and biochemical characterization of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster now provide insights into the biosynthesis of this unique family of secondary metabolites and sets the stage for the generation of new derivatives by genetic engineering. The identity of the cloned gene cluster was confirmed by inactivation of getE, which completely abolished GE81112 production. Although many of the enzymes encoded by the get cluster are consistent with GE81112 biosynthesis, the NRPSs are present with a highly split, non-co linear module arrangement (Fig. 3A). Unusual features include two freestanding A-PCP di-domains (encoded by getJ and getM) and a stand-alone A-domain (encoded by gene getE). Stand-alone A-domains have been identified in other nonlinear NRPS pathways, e.g. myxochelin (36) and yersiniabactin (37), whereas free-standing A-PCP di-domains are found in the zorbamycin and syringomycin gene clusters (38, 39). According to bioinformatic analysis, all NRPS domains are predicted to be functional (supplemental Fig. S2 and S3). Furthermore, because the get cluster encodes five dis-tinct A and PCP domains instead of the four predicted for a tetrapeptide, the order of subunits (and corresponding mod-ules) could not be predicted from sequence alone. The estab-lished specificity for the five A-domains and analysis of the functions predicted from the other enzymes encoded by the cluster allow us to draw a first model for GE81112 formation (Fig. 3C).",
        "Accordingly, the biosynthesis of GE81112 starts with the for-mation of (2S)-pipecolic acid from (2S)-lysine via the action of the putative cyclodeaminase GetD (Fig. 3C). Pipecolic acid is directly activated by the A-domain GetEA1 and then loaded onto the adjacent PCP domain. Consistently, an ATP-PPi exchange assay confirmed that GetEA1 preferentially recog-nizes (2S)-pipecolic acid (Fig. 4A). However, the pipecolic acid moiety in GE81112 is hydroxylated at the None-position. There is precedent for None-hydroxylation to occur at three different stag-es; on the free amino acid (40), whereas the amino acid is teth-ered to the PCP (41), or on themature peptide after thioesterase hydrolysis from the NRPS (42, 43).

We hypothesize that the A-domain GetGA2 is responsible for the incorporation of the second amino acid in GE81112. A recent example in the biosynthesis of the nucleoside antibiotic polyoxin shows that O-carbamoyl-polyhydroxypentanoic acid is generated from free (2S)-glutamate by stepwise reduction, O-carbamoylation, and hydroxylations (44). The complete building block is then attached to the nucleoside. Similarly, GE81112 congeners A and B could derive from activation of the O-HPA substrate (or of a precursor) by the A-domain GetGA2 and loading on the corresponding PCP (Fig. 3C). However, we could not identify candidate genes in the get cluster forO-HPA biosynthesis, so they may be encoded elsewhere in the genome (45, 46). According to our hypothesis, the A-domain GetGA2 must show a broad substrate acceptance, activating O-HPA-and ornithine-based amino acids to generate the different GE81112 congeners. As O-HPA or any derivatives were not commercially available, we tested the likely precursors of O-HPA, (2S)-glutamic acid and (2S)-glutamine in addition to (2S)-ornithine. Activation of all the three amino acids (orni-thine,Glu, andGln)was observed (Fig. 4B) with a preference for (2S)-ornithine. The reduced degree of activation of glutamic acid and glutamine may indicate that modified versions of glu-tamic acid and glutamine are preferred, consistent with the hypothesis that O-HPA is formed before loading to the PCP. It should be noted that themajor congeners of theGE81112 com-plex produced by Streptomyces S. sp. L-49973 are A and B,5 indicating that in vivo O-HPA or a precursor is the preferred substrate for the NRPS.",
        "The third amino acid incorporated into theGE81112 peptide is either histidine (1) or aminohistidine (2 and 3). In silico anal-ysis of GetGA3 predicts specificity for tyrosine or tryptophan rather than histidine. This prediction may indicate a general preference of the A-domain for aromatic amino acid residues, which might account for activation of both histidine and ami-nohistidine. However, it is not clear how the aminohistidine moiety is generated: \u201camination\u201d might occur at the PCP-bound histidine after release of the peptide from the NRPS, or alternatively, aminohistidine could derive from the cyclization of arginine by nucleophilic attack of the None-carbon. According to the ATP-PPi exchange assay, histidine is the preferred sub-strate, and no activation was observed with arginine, trypto-phan, or tyrosine (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that aminohisti-dine is not generated from PCP-bound arginine, tryptophan, or tyrosine, but we could not establish whether GetGA3 also rec-ognizes aminohistidine, as this amino acid is not commercially available. Thus, the nature and timing of histidine amination remains unclear.",
        "A 3-hydroxy-6-chlorohistidine is the last amino acid to be incorporated in GE81112. Halogenation is a common modifi-cation found in bioactive natural products (47\u201349), and the timing of halogenation reactions has been shown to vary. For example, in rebeccamycin, pre-assembly line chlorination of tryptophan occurs (50), whereas a PCP-bound threonine is chlorinated for syringomycin (51). The putative halogenase GetL is the likely candidate for histidine chlorination in GE81112. GetI shows homology to non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases/hydroxylases and is, therefore, assumed to hydrox-ylate histidine at the None-position. Figs. 3, B and C, illustrate the proposed mechanism for the chlorination/hydroxylation of histidine and its incorporation into GE81112. As there is evi-dence from sequence analysis and in vitro experiments (supple-mental Fig. S2 and Fig. 4E) that the A-PCP domains of the seemingly superfluous GetM protein are active, this di-domain may play a role in the biosynthesis of the fourth amino acid precursor. Indeed, there are a number of examples in which specialized A-PCP di-domains are essential for generating NRPS precursors (52\u201356). Here, we propose that theA-domain GetMA5 activates (2S)-histidine, consistent with the results of the ATP-PPi exchange assay, and tethers it to the PCP of GetM. Hydroxylation and/or halogenation reactions then occur on the PCP-bound amino acid as catalyzed by GetI and GetL, respec-tively (Fig. 3B). The thioesterase GetA would then release the modified amino acid, as described for BarC from the barbamide biosynthetic pathway (53). In the subsequent step, the free, modified histidine is activated by the A-domain GetJA4 and loaded onto the PCP ofmodule 4 (Fig. 3C). This is supported by the ATP-PPi exchange assay showing that GetJA4 has specific-ity for (2S)-histidine (Fig. 4D). Again, the relative timing of chlorination and hydroxylation is unclear, as it is conceivable that one of these reactions may occur on the GetJ-tethered amino acid or peptide. In Fig. 3C, GetA is predicted to function as a type II thioesterase to release themodified amino acid from GetM. Alternatively, GetA could act as an aminoacyltrans-ferase, shuttling the PCP-boundmodified histidine fromGetM to GetJ. There are several examples of such PCP-to-PCP shut-tling reactions (38, 55), and the aminoacyltransferases identi-fied to date have been assigned into two groups (38); one group, comprising SyrC, CmaE, and ZmbVIId, contains a GXCXG motif at the active site, and these enzymes are predicted to act as acyltransferases, with the active-site cysteine shown to be directly involved in aminoacyl transfer (52); the second group includes the acyltransferases BarC (53) and CouN7 (54), with an active site serine in the GXSXG motif, and are predicted to function as ordinary thioesterases. GetA and GetN both con-tain active site serines, which suggest that they both function as normal thioesterases and not as aminoacyltransferases (supple-mental Fig. S4). GetN is expected to catalyze the release of the peptide from the assembly line (Fig. 3C).",
