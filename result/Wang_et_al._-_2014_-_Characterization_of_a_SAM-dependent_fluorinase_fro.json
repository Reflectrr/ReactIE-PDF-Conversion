The only known biological fluorination scope is represented by the fl pathway from Streptomyces cattleya that produces fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT). Here we report the identification of a novel pathway for FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis from the actinomycetoma-causing pathogen Nocardia brasiliensis ATCC 700358. The new pathway shares overall conservation with the fl pathway in S. cattleya. Biochemical characterization of the conserved domains revealed a novel fluorinase NobA that can biosynthesize 5\u2019-fluoro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine (5\u2019-FDA) from inorganic fluoride and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). The NobA shows similar halide specificity and characteristics to the fluorination enzyme FlA of the fl pathway. Kinetic parameters for fluoride (Km 4153 \u03bcM, kcat 0.073 min-1) and SAM (Km 416 \u03bcM, kcat 0.139 min-1) have been determined, revealing that NobA is slightly (2.3 fold) slower than FlA. Upon sequence comparison, we finally identified a distinct loop region in the fluorinases that probably accounts for the disparity of fluorination activity.Open Peer ReviewApproval Status 1 2 version 119 Feb 2014view view Changsheng Zhang, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China1.

Organo-fluorines have been widely used in pharmaceuticals, diag-nostics, agrochemicals, and materials3,4, and it is estimated that 20\u201330% of commercial drugs, including many top-sellers, contain fluorine5. The increasing prevalence and success of organo-fluorines have instigated enormous efforts over the past decades in develop-ing methodologies for efficiently introducing fluorine into organic molecules5,6, however the unique properties of fluorine make these chemical incorporations challenging, usually needing harsh syn-thetic conditions and giving rise to moderate chemo-or stereo-selectivity5,6. In contrast to chemical synthesis, biocatalytic synthesis or biosyn-thesis provide better efficacy and selectivity under mild conditions, and can be easily scaled up for industrial production7. Although nat-ural fluorination is rare, efforts in identifying new bio-fluorination machineries are continuing. Pioneered by O\u2019Hagan and co-workers, the natural bio-fluorination pathway to produce fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT) was biochemically characterized in the actinomycete Streptomyces cattleya8. Enzymatic fluorination in S. cattleya occurs via a fluorine-fixation step that is catalyzed by the unique fluorinase enzyme FlA through the nucleophilic attack of fluoride to SAM9\u201311. The resulting fluoro-intermediate 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (5\u2032-FDA) is further converted by five enzymes to give rise to the FAc and 4-FT (Figure 1A and B)8. This power-ful bio-fluorination machinery has been proved very successful in incorporating both 18F and 19F into nucleotides12\u201316 and in produc-ing the anticancer drug candidate fluorosalinosporamide17. Very recently, its enormous potential for producing complex fluorinated molecules was demonstrated by Chang and co-workers18. Using an engaging biosynthetic strategy they were able to achieve site-specific incorporation of FAc into the polyketide backbone of 2-desmethyltriketide lactone. Merging this strategy with the FAC producing pathway, such as the fl pathway in vivo, could present opportunities to use living cells for the production of acetate-derived fluorinated natural products that include polyketides, fatty acids, terpenoids and steroids.Synthetic biology approaches need pools of \u201cgenetic elements\u201d to mix and match to build and optimize synthetic bio-pathways19. However, the only natural bio-fluorination tool available so far is the fl pathway. The limited natural bio-fluorination machinery forms the bottleneck for development of efficient synthetic bio-pathway to produce fluorinated natural products, thus an expansion of the genetic resources of biological fluorination is highly desired. Here, we report the identification of a latent fluorination pathway for Figure 1. Biosynthetic genes and pathways for FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis. (A) Organization of relevant genes in the fl and nob pathway, FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis from the pathogen Nocardia brasiliensis ATCC 700358 and the biochemical characterization of a novel SAM-dependent fluorinase enzyme.Materials and methodsGeneral methods, biochemicals, and chemicalsDNA isolation and manipulation in Escherichia coli were per-formed according to standard methods20,21.

The synthetic gene codon-optimized nobA for expression in E. coli using the OptimumGeneTM algorithm was sourced from GenScript (Nanjing, China). The optimized sequence exhibited 82% identity to the original sequence and is shown below (codons optimized are underlined, restriction sites are in italics): GAATTCCATAT-GACGACGACGAATGGCCGCCGCCCGATTATTGCGTTT ATGAGCGATCTGGGTATCACCGACGACTCCGTGGCACA-GTGTAAGGGTCTGATGCTGAGCGTGTGCCCGGATGTGAC-GATTGTTGACATCTGTCATACCATGCAGCCGTGGGATGTG-GAAGAAGGTGCGCGTTATATTGTTGACCTGCCGCGCCT-GTTTCCGGAGGGTACGGTTTTCGCAACCACGACCTAC-CCGGCAACCGGTACGACCGCACGTAGCGTCGCTCT-GCGTATCGCACATGCCTCTAAAGGCGGTGCACGTGGC-CAGTGGGCAGGTAGTGGTGCAGGTTTCGAACGCAA-GGAAGGCTCATATATTTACATCGCGCCGAACAATGGTCT-GCTGACGACCGTTATTAAAGAACACGGCTATCTGGAAGC-CTACGAAGTTAGCTCTCCGGAAGTCATCCCGGAACAAC-CGGAACCGACCTTTTATTCACGTGAAATGGTGGCACTGC-CGTCGGCTCATCTGGCAGCAGGTTTCCCGCTGGAAAAA-GTCGGTCGTCGCCTGGCAGATGACGAAATTGTGCGTTTT-GAACGCAAGGATCCGGAACTGGTTGCCGATCACGAC-CTGGTCGGTTATGTGACCAACATTGATCATCCGTTTG-GCAACGTTTGGACGAATATCCACCGTACCGACCTG-GAAAAACTGGGTGTCGGCTACGGTACGAAGCTGCGCAT-TACCCTGGATGGTGTGCTGCCGTTTGAACTGCCGCTGTC-CCCGACCTTCGCAGATGCTGGCGAAATCGGTGCAGCT-GTGGCATATCTGAGTTCCCGTGGTTACCTGGCACTG-GCACGTAATGCTGCGTCGCTGGCGTATCCGTATAATCT-GAAGGCGGGTATTTCGGTCCAAGTCAAAGTGGGCTAA-GCTT. The gene of FlA was PCR amplified from genomic DNA of S. cattleya using the forward primer 5\u2032-TTCATATGGCTGC-GAACAGCACACGTC-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-TTAAGCT-TATCAGCGGGCCTCGACCCG-3\u2032. The purified PCR product was ligated to pMD18-T simple (TaKaRa, Japan) following the manu-facturer protocol and its fidelity was confirmed by DNA sequencing (multi-color fluorescence-based DNA analysis). The NdeI-HindIII fragments of nobA and flA were ligated to pET28a to yield the plas-mids pWHU2401 and pWHU2402, respectively, which were then been used to overexpress the NobA and FlA proteins as N-terminal 6\u00d7His-tagged fusion proteins. The resulting expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3 ) cells. The cells were grown in 0.8 L of liquid culture (1\u00d7Luria broth medium with 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin) at 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.6. The cells were allowed to cool room temperature and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 10 hours at 25\u00b0C. The cells were centrifuged (6000 rpm, 10 minutes, 4\u00b0C) resuspended in 15 mL lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) and lysed by sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (15000 rpm, 30 minutes, 4\u00b0C). Two mL Ni-NTA agarose resin was added to the supernatant and the solutions were shaken at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. The protein resin mixtures were loaded into a gravity flow column, and proteins were sequen-tially eluted with 10 mL Buffer A (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 50 mM, 100 mM and 300 mM imidazole, respectively. Purified proteins (10 mL) were buffer exchanged by dialysis in 1 L Buffer B (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) and concentrated by centrifugation using an Amicon Ultra-4 (10 KDa, GE Healthcare). Proteins purity (90\u201395%) was evaluated by 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations of the NobA (5 mg mL-1), FlA (4 mg mL-1) and NobA-S158A (25 mg mL-1) were determined by the Bradford method using a BSA calibration curve. The final proteins were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. Gel filtration chromatography was used to determine the native molecular mass of NobA. Experi-ments were performed at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 using an AKTA Purifier FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a Super-dex 200 GL column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The elution buffer used was 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). The native molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated from a calibration curve plotted by using the standard proteins carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), \u03b2-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa).In vitro enzymatic assays of NobA. Typical assays were performed in 100 \u03bcL of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM SAM, 1\u20135 \u03bcM enzyme and 20 mM NaF or NaCl22. For chlo-rination reaction, additional 1 \u03bcM L-amino acid oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd.) was added in the reaction mixture. Reactions were incubated at 26\u00b0C, quenched by 10 \u03bcL 100% trichloro-acetic acid (TCA) and the supernatants were subjected to HPLC or LC-HRMS analysis using an analytic Inertsil ODS-3 column Page 4 of 15F1000Research 2014, 3:61 Last updated: 28 MAR then incubated at 26\u00b0C for 60 min to HPLC analysis. Neither metal ions nor EDTA was added in the negative control reaction mixture. The formation of 5\u2032-FDA was determined by HPLC and quanti-fied using a standard curve of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH). Each data point represents a minimum of two replicate, end point assays were fitted to the Excel (Microsoft Corporation) to obtain scatter diagram (PH) and histogram (metal ions) for estimating relative activity.Construction and purification of nobA mutant. A nobA mutant was constructed using a standard PCR method21 and the pWHU2401 as a template. The NobA-S158A mutant was constructed with the primer pair 5\u2032-GACCTTTTATGCACGTGAAATGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCATTTCACGTGCATAAAAGGTC-3\u2032 according to a stand-ard protocol21. The construct of pWHU2403 was verified by DNA sequencing and was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3 ) as pre-viously described. The expression and purification procedures of recombinant NobA-S158A were carried out in a manner similar to that described for NobA.Results and discussionA putative gene (nobA) encoding a protein with overall 79% identity to the fluorinase FlA was identified from the genome of N. brasiliensis ATCC 70035823 (Figure 1A). By extending the searching region to the up-downstream of nobA, we further identified a gene cluster of 10 genes (nobA-I, Figure 1A and Table 1). In this gene cluster, four catalytic genes (nobA, B, D and M) encode the homologues of 5\u2032-FDA synthase, 5\u2032-FDA phosphorylase, 5\u2032-FDRP isomerase and 4-FT transaldolase which are responsible for the conversion of fluoride to 5-FDRibulP and fluoroacetaldehyde to 4-FT in the (5 \u03bcm, 4.6\u00d7250 mm, GL Science Inc). HPLC analysis was normally performed with a linear gradient of 5% to 20% CH3 CN (v/v) over 20 minutes, 20% to 5% CH3 CN (v/v) over 1 minute, and 5% CH3 CN (v/v) for further 4 minutes at a flow rate of 1 mL/min under 260 nm. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis was performed as described above. The kinetic parameters for NaF were determined with SAM maintained at a concentration of 0.4 mM and NaF at increasing concentrations from 0 to 20 mM. The kinetic parameters for SAM were deter-mined with a concentration of NaF maintained at 5 mM and SAM at increasing concentrations from 0 to 1 mM. The formation of 5\u2032-FDA was determined by HPLC and quantified using a standard curve of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH). Each data point represents a minimum of three replicate, end point assays were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by OriginPro 9.0 (OriginLab software, Northampton, MA) to obtain estimates for kcat and Km . Determination pH and metal ion effect on the activity of NobA and FlA. A reaction mixture (100 \u03bcl) containing 20 mM NaF, 1 mM SAM in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5\u20135.5), sodium phosphate (pH 6.0\u20137.0), Tris-HCl (pH 7.5\u20139.0), or Gly\u2013sodium hydroxide (pH 9.5\u201310.0) buffer was prepared. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 \u03bcM NobA or FlA, incubated at 26\u00b0C for 30 minutes where the velocity is in the linear range, and then subjected to HPLC analysis. To measure the metal ion effect on the activ-ity, a group of 100 \u03bcl reaction mixtures containing 20 mM NaF, 1 mM SAM in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) buffer were spiked with 1 mM different divalent metal chloride salts (Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+ or Zn2+) or 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to remove the potential associated metal ions of the reaction mixture. Reactions were initiated by addition of 5 \u03bcM NobA or FlA, and Table 1. Putative orfs in the nob biosynthetic pathway from N. brasiliensis (accession number fl pathway)8. Flanked those are genes for encoding auxiliary func-tions, including regulation (nobC, F and G), transportation (nobC, H) and SAM recycling (nobE and I), among of which four (nobF,G, I and H) are homologous to the counterparts in the fl biosynthetic pathway. The overall identity to the fl pathway genes suggested that the nobA cluster might be related to the 4-FT and FAc biosynthesis.Besides the four catalytic genes described above, other two genes encoding an aldolase and a dehydrogenase to mediate the conver-sion of 5-FDRibulP to fluoroacetaldehyde and fluoroacetaldehyde to FAc are necessary. A homology search for the fluoroacetalde-hyde dehydrogenase in the N. brasiliensis resulted in the identi-fication of a gene with 78% identity (nobJ, YP_006807765.1; Figure 1A and Table 1) from a remote site in the genome, confer fluorine fixation, and that the nob pathway might be related to FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis.With a new fluorinase in hand, we next compared the enzymatic properties of the protein. It has been previously reported that in the presence of L-amino acid oxidase (L-AAO), FlA can uti-lize Cl-but not Br-or I-to form the 5\u2032-Chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (5\u2032-ClDA)22. Similarly, we observed that NobA was also able to perform this reaction with a similar reactivity (Figure 4). The optimal pH of NobA was determined as 6.5, slightly lower than FlA at 7.0 (Figure 5A). NobA shows no obvious effects on fluorination E. coli (Figure 2A). In our experiment, the expression yield of NobA (7.9 mg/L) was lower than the yield of FlA (9.2 mg/L), and like FlA it natively occurs as a hexamer (Figure 3)10. The fluorina-tion activity of the recombinant protein was assessed in parallel with FlA which was utilized to produce the 5\u2032-FDA as a control. After the reaction, the assay mixtures were quenched by 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and subjected to HPLC analysis. A product strictly dependent on the addition of SAM, NaF and NobA was detected, and its identity was finally confirmed to be 5\u2032-FDA by both HRMS and comparison to the product of FlA (Figure 2B and C). These results, taken together, indicate that NobA, like FlA, can Figure 3. Determination of the native molecular mass of NobA by gel filtration chromatography.

The discovery of new fluorinases and biosynthetic pathways increases the genetic resource of bio-fluorination and will benefit the future development of synthetic bio-pathways to produce fluorinated natural products.Data availabilityData sets showing the fluorinase catalysed conversions of fluo-ride and chloride to 5\u2032-FDA and 5\u2032-ClDA are publicly available in ZENODO.ZENODO: Conversion of fluoride and chloride catalysed by SAM-dependent fluorinase in Nocardia brasiliensis, doi: 10.5281/zeno-do.833938.

FAc is a highly toxic poison (LD50 = 0.1 mg/kg mouse \u2248 1.2 \u03bcM)34. In the human body itis first converted into the anabolite (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate (EFc), which exerts its toxicity by irreversibly inhibiting aconitase to cause cell death (IC50 = 0.01 \u03bcM)35,36. Interestingly, our research revealed the N. brasiliensis has the genetic potential to produce FAc from fluoride. In human blood, the fluoride concentration is normally around 0.13 \u03bcM and can increase to 3.2 \u03bcM in some fluorine-polluted areas37, which indicates N. brasiliensis can potentially produce FAc at levels that cause severe cytotoxicity and lead to development of the actinomycetoma.In summary, we identified a latent pathway for FAc and 4-FT bio-synthesis from the actinomycetoma pathogen N. brasiliensis ATCC 700358. Comparative analysis of the genomes of N. brasiliensis and S. cattleya revealed two common aldolase genes that were putatively involved in the FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis. By in vitro characterization, we confirmed a novel fluorinase, NobA, that can biosynthesize 5\u2032-FDA from inorganic fluoride and SAM. This new fluorinase has similar substrate selectivity and characteristics to the homologue FlA, with a slightly less efficiency of reaction (2.3 fold). The lower reactivity might be attributed to the presence of a distinct loop region in the sequences of FlA and NobA, based on comparative sequence analysis. During the revision of this manu-script, O\u2019Hagan and co-workers published the identification of the same fluorinase and two other fluorinases from S. sp MA37, Actinoplanes sp N902-10938. These fluorinases are highly conserved (76\u201379% identity to each other) but all have the distinct loop region which is identified by this study (Figure S3). This feature indicates that fluorinases are a unique protein family whose evolution is also unusual, majorly concentrated at the interface of N-and C-domains. Moreover, by searching the homologue of the putative S. cattleya 5-FDRibulP aldolases (YP_004910624 and YP_004919742.1, iden-tified in this study) in the geome of A. sp N902-109 results identi-fication of an aldolase (YP_007950157.1).

        "Abstract Fluorination has been widely used in chemical synthesis, but is rare in nature. The only known biological fluorination scope is represented by the fl pathway from Streptomyces cattleya that produces fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT). Here we report the identification of a novel pathway for FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis from the actinomycetoma-causing pathogen Nocardia brasiliensis ATCC 700358. The new pathway shares overall conservation with the fl pathway in S. cattleya. Biochemical characterization of the conserved domains revealed a novel fluorinase NobA that can biosynthesize 5\u2019-fluoro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine (5\u2019-FDA) from inorganic fluoride and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). The NobA shows similar halide specificity and characteristics to the fluorination enzyme FlA of the fl pathway. Kinetic parameters for fluoride (Km 4153 \u03bcM, kcat 0.073 min-1) and SAM (Km 416 \u03bcM, kcat 0.139 min-1) have been determined, revealing that NobA is slightly (2.3 fold) slower than FlA. Upon sequence comparison, we finally identified a distinct loop region in the fluorinases that probably accounts for the disparity of fluorination",

        "Introduction The introduction of fluorine into organic molecules can often improve their molecular stability and pharmacological properties1,2. Organo-fluorines have been widely used in pharmaceuticals, diag-nostics, agrochemicals, and materials3,4, and it is estimated that 20\u201330% of commercial drugs, including many top-sellers, contain fluorine5. The increasing prevalence and success of organo-fluorines have instigated enormous efforts over the past decades in develop-ing methodologies for efficiently introducing fluorine into organic molecules5,6, however the unique properties of fluorine make these chemical incorporations challenging, usually needing harsh syn-thetic conditions and giving rise to moderate chemo-or stereo-selectivity5,6.",
        "In contrast to chemical synthesis, biocatalytic synthesis or biosyn-thesis provide better efficacy and selectivity under mild conditions, and can be easily scaled up for industrial production7. Although nat-ural fluorination is rare, efforts in identifying new bio-fluorination machineries are continuing. Pioneered by O\u2019Hagan and co-workers, the natural bio-fluorination pathway to produce fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT) was biochemically characterized in the actinomycete Streptomyces cattleya8. Enzymatic fluorination in S. cattleya occurs via a fluorine-fixation step that is catalyzed by the unique fluorinase enzyme FlA through the nucleophilic attack of fluoride to SAM9\u201311. The resulting fluoro-intermediate 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (5\u2032-FDA) is further converted by five enzymes to give rise to the FAc and 4-FT (Figure 1A and B)8. This power-ful bio-fluorination machinery has been proved very successful in incorporating both 18F and 19F into nucleotides12\u201316 and in produc-ing the anticancer drug candidate fluorosalinosporamide17. Very recently, its enormous potential for producing complex fluorinated molecules was demonstrated by Chang and co-workers18. Using an engaging biosynthetic strategy they were able to achieve site-specific incorporation of FAc into the polyketide backbone of 2-desmethyltriketide lactone. Merging this strategy with the FAC producing pathway, such as the fl pathway in vivo, could present opportunities to use living cells for the production of acetate-derived fluorinated natural products that include polyketides, fatty acids, terpenoids and",
        "steroids.Synthetic biology approaches need pools of \u201cgenetic elements\u201d to mix and match to build and optimize synthetic bio-pathways19. However, the only natural bio-fluorination tool available so far is the fl pathway. The limited natural bio-fluorination machinery forms the bottleneck for development of efficient synthetic bio-pathway to produce fluorinated natural products, thus an expansion of the genetic resources of biological fluorination is highly desired. Here, we report the identification of a latent fluorination pathway for",

The purified PCR product was ligated to pMD18-T simple (TaKaRa, Japan) following the manu-facturer protocol and its fidelity was confirmed by DNA sequencing (multi-color fluorescence-based DNA analysis). The NdeI-HindIII fragments of nobA and flA were ligated to pET28a to yield the plas-mids pWHU2401 and pWHU2402, respectively, which were then been used to overexpress the NobA and FlA proteins as N-terminal 6\u00d7His-tagged fusion proteins. The resulting expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3 ) cells. The cells were grown in 0.8 L of liquid culture (1\u00d7Luria broth medium with 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin) at 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.6. The cells were allowed to cool room temperature and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 10 hours at 25\u00b0C. The cells were centrifuged (6000 rpm, 10 minutes, 4\u00b0C) resuspended in 15 mL lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) and lysed by sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (15000 rpm, 30 minutes, 4\u00b0C). Two mL Ni-NTA agarose resin was added to the supernatant and the solutions were shaken at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. The protein resin mixtures were loaded into a gravity flow column, and proteins were sequen-tially eluted with 10 mL Buffer A (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 50 mM, 100 mM and 300 mM imidazole, respectively. Purified proteins (10 mL) were buffer exchanged by dialysis in 1 L Buffer B (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) and concentrated by centrifugation using an Amicon Ultra-4 (10 KDa, GE Healthcare). Proteins purity (90\u201395%) was evaluated by 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations of the NobA (5 mg mL-1), FlA (4 mg mL-1) and NobA-S158A (25 mg mL-1) were determined by the Bradford method using a BSA calibration curve.

After the reaction, the assay mixtures were quenched by 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and subjected to HPLC analysis.

Interestingly, our research revealed the N. brasiliensis has the genetic potential to produce FAc from fluoride. In human blood, the fluoride concentration is normally around 0.13 \u03bcM and can increase to 3.2 \u03bcM in some fluorine-polluted areas37, which indicates N. brasiliensis can potentially produce FAc at levels that cause severe cytotoxicity and lead to development of the",
        "actinomycetoma.In summary, we identified a latent pathway for FAc and 4-FT bio-synthesis from the actinomycetoma pathogen N. brasiliensis ATCC 700358. Comparative analysis of the genomes of N. brasiliensis and S. cattleya revealed two common aldolase genes that were putatively involved in the FAc and 4-FT biosynthesis. By in vitro characterization, we confirmed a novel fluorinase, NobA, that can biosynthesize 5\u2032-FDA from inorganic fluoride and SAM. This new fluorinase has similar substrate selectivity and characteristics to the homologue FlA, with a slightly less efficiency of reaction (2.3 fold). The lower reactivity might be attributed to the presence of a distinct loop region in the sequences of FlA and NobA, based on comparative sequence analysis. During the revision of this manu-script, O\u2019Hagan and co-workers published the identification of the same fluorinase and two other fluorinases from S. sp MA37, Actinoplanes sp N902-10938. These fluorinases are highly conserved (76\u201379% identity to each other) but all have the distinct loop region which is identified by this study (Figure S3). This feature indicates that fluorinases are a unique protein family whose evolution is also unusual, majorly concentrated at the interface of N-and C-domains. Moreover, by searching the homologue of the putative S. cattleya 5-FDRibulP aldolases (YP_004910624 and YP_004919742.1, iden-tified in this study) in the geome of A. sp N902-109 results identi-fication of an aldolase (YP_007950157.1).
