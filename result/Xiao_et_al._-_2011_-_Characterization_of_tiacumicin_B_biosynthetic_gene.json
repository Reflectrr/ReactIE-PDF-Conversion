China bS Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The RNA polymerase inhibitor tiacumicin B is currently undergoing phase III clinical trial for treatment of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea with great promise. To understand the biosynthetic logic and to lay a foundation for generating structural analogues via pathway engineering, the tiacumicin B biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and characterized from the producer Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subsp. hamdenensis NRRL 18085. Sequence analysis of a 110 633 bp DNA region revealed the presence of 50 open reading frames (orfs). Functional investigations of 11 orfs by in vivo inactivation experiments, preliminarily outlined the boundaries of the tia-gene cluster and suggested that 31 orfs were putatively involved in tiacumicin B biosynthesis. Functions of a halogenase (TiaM), two glycosyltransferases (TiaG1 and TiaG2), a sugar C-methyltransferase (TiaS2), an acyltransferase (TiaS6), and two cytochrome P450s (TiaP1 and TiaP2) were elucidated by isolation and structural characterization of the metabolites from the corresponding gene-inactivation mutants. Accumulation of 18 tiacumicin B analogues from 7 mutants not only provided experimental evidence to confirm the proposed functions of individual biosynthetic enzymes, but also set an example of accessingmicrobial natural product diversity via genetic approach.More importantly, biochemical characterization of the FAD-dependent halogenase TiaM reveals a sequentially acting dihalogenation step tailoring tiacumicin B biosynthesis. \u2019 INTRODUCTION Tiacumicin B (1, Chart 1), also known as lipiarmycin A3, PAR-101, OPT-80, Difimicin and Fidaxomicin,1 is produced by Dactylosporangiumaurantiacum subsp. hamdenensisNRRL 18085,2 Actinoplanes deccanensis ATCC 21983,3,4 Micromonospora echi-nospora subsp. armeniaca,5 and Catellatospora sp. Bp3323-81.6 Tiacumicin B (1) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic against various Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, especially diarrhea-associated Clostridium difficile, with low minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values.7-10 Recently, tiacumicin B was demonstrated to be effective against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with no cross-resistance to rifampicin,6 and was also shown to exhibit good anticancer activities.11 Currently, tiacumicin B is undergoing phase III clinical trials, developed by Optimer Phar-maceuticals, Inc., for the treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI).

Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE Tiacumicin B is shown to be statistically superior to vancomycin, the only FDA approved product for CDI, in better global cure rates and fewer relapses (http://www.optimerpharma.com).Additionally, tiacumicin B exhibits no toxicities in animal studies,12 making it a promising drug candidate. However, the mechanism of tiacumicin action is not well understood. Tiacumicin B is found as a bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitor and inhibits the holoenzyme better than the core enzyme.3,13 Recent genetic and biochemical studies reveal that tiacumicin B blocks the early step of open-promoter-complex formation, suggesting a newmechanism of transcription inhibitor action.14 The chemical structure of tiacumicin B (1) was elucidated by extensive spectral analyses and was finally confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies.2,4,15-17 Tiacumicin B belongs to a family of novel 18-membered macrocyclic glycosides and contains an unsaturated macrolide core scaffold, two modified D-rhamnose residues, and a dichlorinated homo-orsellinic acidmoiety (Figure 1). Tiacumicin B is a member of halogenated natural products which comprise diverse structures (Chart 1, 1-8), exemplified by enediynes (calicheamicin \u03b31 I, 2, and C-1027, 3),18,19 ortho-somycins (avilamycin A, 4),20 macrolides (chlorothricin, 5, and radicicol, 6),21-23 hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides (pyoluteorin, 7),24 and small hormone molecules (DIF-1, 8),25 displaying a wide range of biological activities including anti-bacterial, antitumor, and quorum sensing properties. Recently, a variety of nature's strategies for biohalogenation have been demonstrated both biochemically and structurally.26-28 For example, SgcC3 and PltAwere shown to catalyze chlorinations on substrates tethered with discrete carrier proteins in C-1027 (3) and pyoluteorin (7) biosynthesis,19,24 respectively. ChlA-catalyzed dichlorinations on a free smallmolecule were demonstrated to be a tailoring strategy for DIF-1 (8) biosynthesis.25 Structurally, 1, 2, 4, and 5 contain a similar halogenated aromatic moiety of polyketide origin as 8; however, the halogenation strategies for these mole-cules remain uncharacterized. The structure-activity relationship studies reveal that tiacu-micin B with an R-hydroxyl group at C-18 is more potent than its S-congener for antibacterial activity.16 Up to date, most 1 analogues were isolated from the producing strains by varying fermentation conditions;16,17,29 chemical efforts to diversify 1were limited to make 1 benzylidene acetal derivatives for anticancer evaluations.11 The unavailability of 1 genetic locus impeded the alternative to access 1 structural diversity via pathway engineer-ing. To this end, herein we report the cloning and characteriza-tion of the intact 1 biosynthetic gene cluster fromD. aurantiacum NRRL 18085. The sequencing of the entire tia gene cluster allows the assignment of functions to deduced gene products, and paves the way to genetic and biochemical characterization of the 1 biosynthetic pathway. Structural elucidation of eighteen 1 analogues accumulated from 7 key tia gene-inactivation mutants not only provides experimental evidence to confirm the proposed functions of individual biosynthetic enzymes, but also sets an example of accessing microbial natural product diversity via genetic approach. More importantly, the biochemical characterization of Chart 1. Chemical Structures for Tiacumicin B (1), Calicheamicin \u03b31 I (2), C-1027 (3), Avilamycin A (4), Chlorothricin (5), Radicicol (6), Pyoluteorin (7), and DIF (8)a aHalogens are highlighted by dashed circles. 1094 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J.

TiaM represents the first characterized tailoring halogenase of prokaryotic origin. \u2019EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Reagents. Strains and plasmids used and generated in this study are listed inTable S1.D. aurantiacum subsp. hamdenensisNRRL 18085 was obtained from Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Culture Collection (NRRL). Chemicals and reagents for biochem-ical and molecular biology were purchased from standard commercial sources. DNA Isolation,Manipulation, and Sequencing. DNA isolation and manipulations in Escherichia coli and Actinomycetes were performed according to standard procedures.30,31 PCR amplifications were carried out on an Authorized Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf AG). Primers were synthe-sized in Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. DNA sequencing was performed at the Invitrogen Biotech Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou), the Major Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai), and Chinese National Genome Center (Shanghai). Genomic Library Construction and Screening. A genomic library ofD. aurantiacumNRRL 18085 was constructed in SuperCos1 by using the Gigapack III Gold Packaging Extract system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). A 0.55 kb halo-probe for halogenase was amplified by adopting previously reported primers 50-TTCCCSCGSTACCASATCGGSGAG-30 (forward) and 50-GSGGG-ATSWMCCAGWACCASCC-30 (reverse),32 and confirmed by cloning, sequencing, and blasting. A \u223c0.7 kb DNA fragment targeting modular type I polyketide synthases was amplified using the primers 50-CTW-CGTSGAGGCSCAYGGCACSGG-30 (forward) and 50-CCRTGMCC-SGAGAASACCCASAC-30 (reverse). DNA sequencing revealed two different types of sequences, designated as PKS probe-I (in pCSG1104) and PKS probe-II (in pCSG1105), respectively (Table S1). These 3 probes (halo-probe, PKS probes I and II) were used to screen against approximately 2000 colonies by colony hybridization using DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit I (Roche), and resultant positive clones were further confirmed by PCR. Overlaps between positive clones were determined by restriction analyses. Detailed procedures were described in the Supporting Information. Sequence Analysis. The DNA sequence of the tia gene cluster has been deposited into GenBank under the accession number HQ011923. The orfs were determined by using the FramePlot 4.0beta program (http://nocardia.nih.go.jp/fp4/). Protein sequences were compared with BLAST programs (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Do-main organization and substrate specificities for PKSs were predicted by PKS/NRPS analysis program (http://www.nii.res.in/searchall.html). Figure 1.

Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE Gene Inactivation Experiments. The lambda-RED-mediated gene replacements were performed as standard procedures.33,34 The gene inactivation experiments in D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085 were carried out using a recently developed genetic manipulation system.35 Detailed procedures for individual gene inactivation were described in Supporting Information (Tables S1 and S2, Figure S2). Production, Isolation, and Structural Elucidation of Tia-cumicin B and Its Analogues. The wild type strainD. aurantiacum NRRL 18085 and the mutants were cultured in YMS (Yeast extract 0.4%, malt extract 1%, soluble starch 0.4%, CoCl2 3 6H2O 5 mg/L, pH 7.2-7.4) or ISP2medium(Yeast extract 0.4%,malt extract 1%, glucose 0.4%, pH 7.2) for 3-5 days. The 5% inoculumswere seeded in 200mLof production medium (Fish powder 1%, glucose 2%, yeast extract 0.25%, casamino acid 0.25%, CaCO3 0.3%, K2HPO4 0.05%, MgSO4 3 7H2O 0.05%, KCl 0.03%, XAD-16 resin 4%, pH 7.0) in 1 L flask and then shaken at 250 rpm and 30 NoneC for 5-10 days.36 The production of 1 and its analogues was monitored via HPLC analysis on a Varian Star Workstation. HPLC was carried out using a reversed phase column Luna C18, 5 \u03bcm, 150None 4.6 mm (Phenomenex) with UV detection at 254 nm under the following program: solvent system (solvent A, 10% acetonitrile in water supplementing with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); solvent B, 90% acetonitrile in water); 5% B to 100% B (linear gradient, 0-20 min), 100% B (20-21 min), 100% B to 5%B (21-22min), 5% B (22-30min); flow rate at 1mL/min. For isolation of the product from the tiaMmutant TCM50, the XAD-16 resin was separated by sieving from approximately 6 L fermentation broths and then eluted with ethanol. Ethanol was evaporated and the oily residues were extracted 5 times with ethyl acetate to afford crude extracts after evaporation. The crude extracts were subjected to silica gel column chromatography (300-400mesh, 150 g) and elutedwithCHCl3/CH3OH (100:0 to 0:100) to give 4 fractions (Fr.1 to Fr.4). Each fraction was monitored by HPLC. The Fr.3 containing the desired product was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). Desired fractions were collected and further purified by semipreparative C18 reverse phase HPLC (YMC*GEL ODS-A, 12 nm S-50 \u03bcm, 30 None 2.5 cm i.d.), elutingwith a linear gradient (CH3CN/H2O5-72%, 120min), to afford 210.0 mg of 9. Detailed procedures for the isolation of compounds 10-26 were described in Supporting Information , supple-mental methods. 1H-and 13CNMR and 2DNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-500 MHz NMR spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Mass spectral data were obtained on a quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Waters) for the HRFABMS (High Resolution Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectrometry). The optical rotation was recorded on a 341 polarimeter from Perkin-Elmer. Spectral data of structural elucidation for compounds 9-26 were summar-ized in Supporting Information (Tables S3 and S4, Figures S3-S19). Heterologous Production and Purification of TiaM and SsuE. The tiaM gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085 using the following primer pair: 50-GGAC-CATATGCCAAAGGTAATCGTC-30 (forward, NdeI) and 50-CAT-GAATTCTCCTCAAG GTGGGGA-30 (reverse, EcoRI) with high fidelity DNA polymerase Pyrobest (Takara). The FAD-reductase gene ssuE was amplified from genomic DNA of E. coli BL21(DE3) with primers 50-GGAGAGCATATGCGTGTCATCACCCTG-30(forward, NdeI) and 50-CAGGAATTCTTACGCATG GGCATTAC-30 (reverse, EcoRI). Both PCR products were digested withNdeI/EcoRI and inserted into pET28a, to give the expression plasmids pCSG99 (for tiaM) and pCSG117 (for ssuE) after sequence confirmation (Table S1), respec-tively. Strains E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pCSG99 or pCSG117 were grown inLBmediumat 37 NoneCto anA600 of around0.7 and the expressionof TiaM or SsuE was then induced by the addition of 0.1 mM of isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4-5 h at 20-25 NoneC. N-(His)6-tagged TiaM and SsuE were purified via affinity chromatography. Cells were disrupted by sonification on ice in the binding buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The cellular lysates were centrifuged at 13 500 g for 0.5 h. SsuE was further purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2\u00fe-NTA) agarose (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The purification of TiaM was achieved by loading supernatants onto a HisTrap HT column (1mL, GEHealthcare) on a Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC, GE Healthcare) and eluting with a linear gradient of 10-500 mM imidazole in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The purified protein was desalted through PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and stored in 50mMphosphate buffer (pH7.4) containing 1mMdithiothreitol (DTT) and 20% glycerol at -80 NoneC until use. Enzyme Assays. A standard TiaM assay mixtures contained 26 \u03bcM 9, 0.1 mM FAD, 4 mM NADH, 100 mM NaCl, 2.9 \u03bcM TiaM, and 0.22 \u03bcM SsuE in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL. The reaction was performed at 30 NoneC for 2 h. Then assay mixtures were extracted with 3 vol of ethyl acetate. After removing ethyl acetate by vacuum evaporation, the residues were dissolved in methanol and subjected to HPLC analysis. To isolate the enzymatic products, reactions were scaled up to 450 mL using TiaM crude extracts instead of purified proteins and the incubation time was prolonged to 4 h. Finally, 1.2 mg of 29 was purified from the reaction mixture as a white solid. Spectral data of structural elucidation for compound 29 were summar-ized in Supporting Information (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S20). \u2019RESULTS Cloning and Sequencing of the Tiacumicin B Gene Cluster from D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085. We set out to probe the 1 biosynthetic gene cluster by PCR with degenerate primers targeting type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and halogenase genes. We retrieved a halogenase probe (halo-probe) and two PKS probes I and II (see Experimental Section for details) by PCR. Subsequently, the digoxigenin-(DIG)-labeled halo-probe and PKS-probes I and II were utilized to screen approximately 2000 clones of a SuperCos1-based genomic library of D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085. Using the PKS-probes I and II, the same set of 16 positive cosmids (pCSG1-pCSG16) was isolated, of which 8 cosmids were also positive with the halo-probe. Next, the target PKS I allele was inactivated by a genetic system previously developed for the producer D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085.35 The resulting mutant lost the ability to produce 1, suggesting its involvement in 1 biosynthesis. Finally, restriction analyses of the 16 positive cosmids revealed that they overlapped in a DNA region of approximately 105 kb (Figure S1). End-sequencing of the left-hand side of pCSG10 suggests the need for further extension to cover the entire 1 gene cluster. Therefore, additional chromosomal walking was performed from the left end of pCSG10 by PCR (Figure 1), resulting in the identification of two positive clones, namely, pCSG17 and pCSG18 (Figure S1). Three overlapping cosmids, pCSG5, pCSG6, and pCSG10, were entirely sequenced by a shotgun approach. For covering the entire tia-gene cluster, approximately 5 kb DNA fragment in pCSG17, upstream of the left-end of pCSG10 (Figure S1), was further analyzed by subcloning and sequencing. Finally, a total of 110 633 bp contiguous sequence was determined to encompass the complete tia-gene cluster. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequenced region reveals an overall high GC content (71.2%) and 50 orfs (Figure 1). The deduced functions of individual orfs are summarized in Table 1, assigned by comparison with known proteins in database. PreliminaryDetermination of the tia-GeneCluster Bound-aries. Both genes orf(-1) and orf(-2) encode putative trans-posases, and the orf(-3) encodes a hypothetical protein (Table 1), showing no relevance to 1 biosynthesis. We inactivated the 1096 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE gene orf(-1) via replacement of the aac(3)IV gene cassette to obtain a mutant TCM58 (Figure S2A). HPLC-MS analysis revealed that TCM58 produced a single major product with the same retention time (17.7 min) and the same molecular weight Table 1. Deduced orf Functions in the tia Biosynthetic Gene Cluster 1097 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE (m/z 1079.4, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe) as that produced by the wild-type strain and the 1 standard (Figure 2A-C). The production level was comparable to the wild-type strain, suggesting that orf(-1) is beyond the tia-gene cluster. In contrast, the inactivation of a putative glycosyltransferase (GT)-encoding gene tiaG1 (Figure S2B), immediately downstream of orf(-1), led to the abolish-ment of 1 production and the accumulation of new products (Figure 2H), confirming that tiaG1 plays an essential role in 1 biosynthesis. The downstream boundary of the tia-gene cluster is intriguing. From the bioinformatic analysis, the deduced products of orfs1-15 exhibit no significant functions putatively related to 1 biosynthesis (Table 1). The inactivation of orf1 (Figure S2C), encoding a putative short chain dehydrogenase, led to themutant TCM73 exhibiting no effects on 1 production (Figure 2D), clearly excluding its role in 1 biosynthesis. Subsequently, the gene tiaR2, encoding a putative ArsR family transcriptional regulator, im-mediately next to orf1, was also inactivated (Figure S2D). The resulting mutant TCM72 still produced 1 (Figure 2E), however, at a slightly enhanced level, arguably indicating that tiaR2 is a putative negative regulator. These experimental results, together with the functional assignment of individual orfs by bioinformatic analyses, suggest that the tia gene cluster presumably contains 31 orfs flanked by tiaG1 and tiaR2, and spans a DNA region of approximately 83 kb (Figure 1, Table 1). Biosynthesis of the Tiacumicin Aglycone, Tiacumicinone. Four genes, tiaA1-tiaA4, encoding the multifunctional type I modular PKSs, are transcribed in the same direction and arranged collinearly with their predicted functional domains for loading, chain elongation, andmodification, as outlined in Figure 3A. The tia type I PKSs consist of a loading module and 8 extending modules, comprising 40 predicted functional domains. The loading module contains the acyltransferase (ATL) and the acyl carrier protein (ACPL) domains. Propionyl-CoA is proposed to be a starter unit initiating the PKS assembly in 1 biosynthesis (Figure 3A), similar to 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) in erythromycin biosynthesis.37,38 Sequence analysis of AT domains in extending modules reveals three distinct motifs believed to be directly involved in substrate selectivity: \u201cQ...GHSIGE...HAFH\u201d in modules 1, 6 and 7, specific for malonyl-CoA; \u201cQ...GHSQGE... YASH\u201d in modules 2, 3, 5 and 8, specific for (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA; and \u201cQ...GSSQGE...VASH\u201d in the module 4, specific for (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA.39 The substrate specificities of these AT domains match perfectly to the extender units predicted in the Figure 2. HPLC analyses of metabolite profile of tia-gene-inactivated 1098 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE PKS assembly line of 1 biosynthesis (Figure 3A). In our in vivo experiments, the tiaA1-inactivation mutant TCM77 lost the ability to produce 1 (Figure 2F, Figure S2E). Consequently, we propose that TiaA1-A4, in a mechanistic analogy to a typical noniterative type I PKS, catalyze the formation of the 18-membered macro-cyclic aglycone, tiacumicinone (13, Figure 3A). Biosynthesis and Modification of the Homo-Orsellinic Acid Moiety. The deduced product of tiaB contains characteristic type I PKS domains and is supposed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of the aromatic moiety (homo-orsellinic acid) in 1. Bioinformatic analysis shows that TiaB carries PKS domains for ketosynthase (KS), AT, dehydratase (DH), keto reductase (KR) and ACP, and displays the highest sequence similarity to ChlB1, a 6-methyl-salicyclic acid synthase.21,40 However, the DH domain lacks the conserved motif (HxxxGxxxxP) for activity,41 and the characteristic Rossmann-fold of NADP(H) binding motif is not identified in the KR domain, implying that both KR and DH domains in TiaB are inactive. Indeed, formation of the homo-orsellinic acid moiety in 1 does not require functional KR and DH domains (Figure 3B). However, distinct from orsellinic acid synthases CalO5 and AviM,18,20 TiaB may utilize an unusual propionyl-CoA but not acetyl-CoA as a starter unit, leading to the formation of homo-orsellinic acid moiety. Immediately upstream of tiaB, there lies the tiaF gene. TiaF shares high sequence similarities to acyltransferases, such as ChlB3 (58% identity) and ChlB6 (34% identity) for chlorothricin (5),21,42 CalO4 (55% identity) for calicheamicin \u03b31 I (2),18 and AviN (51% identity) for avilamycin A (4),20 which are all putatively responsible for incor-poration of an aromatic moiety into the corresponding secondary metabolites (Chart 1). Therefore, we suppose that TiaF likely Figure 3. Proposed biosynthetic pathway for tiacumicin B. (A) A model for PKS-directed skeleton assembly and tailoring modifications; (B) pathway 1099 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE transferred the homo-orsellinic acid moiety to the 2-O-methyl-D-rhamnose residue. A single FADH2-dependent halogenase-encoding gene, tiaM, is identified in the tia gene cluster. TiaM contains a common Rossmann motif GxGxxG at the N-terminal for FAD-and NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases, and a conserved motif WxWxIP putatively for halide-binding.43 TiaM shows the highest similarity to the halogenase CrpH (39% identity) in cryptophycin biosynthesis.44 Since there are two chlorines in 1, TiaM probably catalyzes a dihalogenation reaction. To verify this hypothesis, the tiaM gene was inactivated, resulting in themutant TCM50 (Figure S2F). HPLC-analysis of fermentation broth of TCM50 revealed the production of a major product (Figure 2G). The product was isolated and its chemical formula was determined to be C52H76O18, lacking two chlorines, by the HRFABMS data (m/z 1011.4938, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe; calculated, 1011.4929). Full NMR characterization (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) clearly revealed the isolated compound to have the structure of 9 (Chart 2). Two additional proton signals [6.20 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-4000), 6.26 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-6000)] were present in 9 (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S3) when comparing with 1.2 In the HMBC spectrum of 9, these two proton signals showed strong correla-tions to C-2000, C-4000, C-8000, and to C-2000, C-6000, demonstrating their locations at C-6000 and C-4000, respectively. Thus, we conclude that TiaM is responsible for incorporation of two chlorines in 1. Genes Putatively Involved in Precursor Supply of Starter and Extender Units. Two genes in the tia gene cluster, tiaC and tiaD, putatively encode E1-alpha and E1-beta subunits, two components of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogen-ase (BCDH) complex. BCDH complex is possibly involved in the generation of isobutyryl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and other acyl-CoA analogues by the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-branched-chain fatty acids derived from alpha-branched-chain amino acids.45 However, the tia gene cluster lacks the other components of the BCDH complex including a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), and a requisite alpha-branched-chain amino acid transaminase.46 The deduced product of tiaL gene displays high similarity to the propionyl-CoA carboxylase, probably catalyzing the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to form (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA.47 The genes tiaJ, tiaN, and tiaK are identified to encode for hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, crotonyl-CoA hydratase, and crotonyl-CoA carbox-ylase/reductase, respectively. These enzymes were recently eluci-dated to be involved in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway.48,49 Especially, the crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase is identified as a key enzyme and a marker for the presence of the ethylma-lonyl-CoA pathway.48 Thus, TiaJ, TiaN, and TiaK probably contribute to provide the ethylmalonyl-CoA extender unit for 1 PKS. The deduced product of tiaE shares high identity (61%) with NysE, a putative type II thioesterase (TE) in nystatin biosynthesis.50 In polyketide biosynthesis, Type II TE may func-tion as editing enzymes, likely to remove aberrant precursors.51 Thus, TiaE may be functional to promote the accuracy and efficiency of 1 PKS process. SugarBiosynthesis andModifications. TiacumicinB (1) bears two modified D-rhamnose moieties. D-rhamnose was biosynthesized through sequential conversionofGDP-D-mannosebyGDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (Gmd) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose reduc-tase (Rmd).52 Interestingly, three putative Gmds, encoded by tiaS1, tiaS3, and tiaS4, were identified in the tia gene cluster. Both TiaS3 and TiaS4 displayed high sequence identity to NysDIII (60% and 70%, respectively), a characterizedGmd involved in themycosamine biosynthesis of polyene antibiotic nystatin.53TiaS1 shows the highest homology (58% identity) to a putative Gmd from Prochlorococcus marinus.54However, no specific Rmds are identified. SomeGmds are found to be bifunctional and are also able to catalyze the same stereospecific reduction like Rmds;52,55 we suppose that at least one of TiaS1, TiaS3, and TiaS4 is functional as a Rmd. TiaS2 contains two conserved domains, methyltransf_13 [pfam08421] at N-termi-nus and methyltransf_14 [pfam08484] at C-terminus, characteristic for bacterialC-methyltransferases, requisite for transformingGDP-D-rhamnose into GDP-5-methyl-D-rhamnose. TiaS5 shares 39% iden-tity with StfMIII, an O-methyltransferase involved in steffimycin biosynthesis.56 TiaS5 is probably responsible for biosynthesizing 2-O-methyl-D-rhamnose. TiaG1 and TiaG2 share 50% identity to each other and both display high similarities to NysDI and AmphDI, two characterized GDP-sugar dependent GTs from nystatin and amphotericin biosynthetic gene clusters.57 Additionally, TiaS6 is found to exhibit the closest homology to MppM, an isovaleryltrans-ferase, in the mannopeptimycins gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus.58 TiaS6 contains a conserved domain of acyltransfer-ase_3 [pfam01757] and probably is responsible for esterifying the 7-carbon sugar with small fatty acids. Upon these bioinformatic analyses, a pathway for sugar biosynthesis and modifications is proposed, as outlined in Figure 3C. To probe the specific functions of GTs, both tiaG1 and tiaG2 were inactivated via replacement with the aac(3)IV cassette, conferring the apramycin resistant mutants, TCM 57 and TCM 64 (Figure S2B andG), respectively. Bothmutants lost the ability to produce 1 and accumulated novel products (Figure 2H,I). By fermentation of the tiaG1-mutant TCM57, 5 new products were isolated and 4 of them were structurally elucidated to be 11-14 (Chart 2), by HRFABMS and full NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC) spectral analyses (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S5 for 11, Figure S6 for 12, Figure S7 for 13, and Figure S8 for 14). Comparing with 1, signals of the 7-carbon sugar residue were missing in their 1H and 13CNMR spectroscopic data of compounds 11-14; consistent with this, the C-11 was found to shift upfield about 10 ppm (Tables S3 and S4). These data confirmed that compounds 11-14 lacked the 7-carbon sugar residue at C-11 (Chart 2). The molecular formula of compound 10 was estab-lished as C31H48O10 on the basis of HRFABMS (m/z 603.3110, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe; calculated, 603.3145). Comparingwith the compound 12, there were no signals for aromatic moiety in 10 (Figure S4). The doublet methyl group in 12 was also absent in 10. A unique oxygenated sp3methylene carbon [\u03b4H 3.79 (1H,m), 3.91 (1H,m), \u03b4C 60.9 t] was found in 10, and the C-50 in 10 was found to shift 3.2 ppm upfield (Tables S3 and S4), indicating that there was a hydroxyl group at C-60 in 10. Therefore, the structure was deduced to be 10 (Chart 2). Subsequently, 4 new products were isolated from the tiaG2-mutant TCM64 and were determined to be 15-18 (Chart 2). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 15-18 presented only one anomeric proton, suggesting the presence of a single sugar residue in these compounds. The anomeric proton showed strong HMBC correlation to C-11, and consistently, H-11 was found to have HMBC correlation to C-100 (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S9 for 15, Figure S10 for 16, Figure S11 for 17, and Figure S12 for 18). These data unequivocally established the glycosylation at C-11 and the sugar residue at C-20 was missing in 15-18. Taken together, our experimental facts unambigu-ously established that TiaG1 was the 5-C-methyl-D-rhamnosyl-transferase (C-11) and TiaG2 was the 2-O-methyl-D-rhamnosyl-transferase (C-20) (Figure 3C). Inactivation of tiaS2, a C-methyl-transferase encoding gene, was also carried out to give themutant 1100 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE TCM55 (Figure S2H). The TCM55 mutant lost 1 production and accumulated 3 major products (Figure 2J). The first product (19) was isolated and characterized by MS (m/z 1065.3988, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe; calculated, 1065.3993) and NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, andHMBC, Figure S13). In comparison with the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1, two singlet methyls and the linking quaternary carbon in 1 were missing in 19, instead, one doublet methyl [\u03b4H 1.13 (3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz, Me-600), \u03b4C 18.1 (q, Me-600)] and one methine [\u03b4H 3.28 (1H, dd, J = 6.5, 9.5 Hz, Me-500), \u03b4C 71.4 (d, Me-500)] were found in 19, suggesting the loss of a methyl group. In the HMBC spectrum of 19, the proton signals for the methyl doublet showed strong correlations to C-400 and C-500, indicating that the methyl group was located at C-500. The large 0H, 0H coupling constant (J = 9.5 Hz) of H-400 and H-500 in C-11 sugar moiety suggested that H-400 and H-500 adopted axial orientations in 19. In the NOESY spectrum of 19, the H-500 had correlation to axial oriented H-100, providing further support of the axial orientation of H-500. Thus, the compound was eluci-dated to have the structure of 19 (Chart 2), consistent with the prediction of TiaS2 as a sugar C-methyltransferase. The latter two products were characterized to be 12 and 13, respectively, by comparing their retention times (18.6 min for 12 and 19.2 min for 13) and molecular masses (m/z 819.3, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe; and m/z 425.3, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe) to standard 12 and 13, previously isolated from TCM57 (Figure 2J,H). Inactivation of tiaS6 gave the mutant TCM53 (Figure S2I), which produced two major products (Figure 2K). The first product was characterized to be 11, deducing from its retention time (14.7 min) and molecular weight (m/z 441.3, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe) by comparison to standard 11 previously isolated from tiaG1-mutant TCM57 (Figure 2K,H). The latter one (20) was isolated and its molecular formula was established as C48H68O16Cl2 on the basis of HRFABMS (m/z 993.3831, [M\u00fe Na]\u00fe; calculated, 993.3782). Comparing the 1H and 13C NMR data with 1, signals for the isobutyryl moiety were missing in 20 (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S14). Additionally, HMBC spectra of 20 showed that an ethyl group was linked to C-17, indicating no hydroxyl group at C-18 (Figure S14). Taken together, the compoundwas identified as 20 (Chart 2). Combining with the bioinformatic analysis (Table 1), we concluded that TiaS6 was an acyltransferase, responsible for incorporation of the isobutyryl moiety. Genes Encoding Cytochrome P450 Hydroxylases. The tiaP1 and tiaP2 genes encode putative cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which belong to a large and diverse group of enzymes involved in the oxygenation of natural products. Both TiaP1 and TiaP2 contain the conserved O2 binding motif `LLxAGxxT' and the C-terminal heme binding site, `FGxGx-HxCxG', typical for CYPs.59 TiaP1 displays high similarities to LnmAandSfmO3, twoCYPs involved in leinamycin and saframycin A biosynthesis,60,61 respectively. TiaP2 resembles a putative CYP in Streptosporangium roseumDSM43021. The functions of TiaP1 and TiaP2 were investigated by in vivo inactivation experiments. The tiaP1 inactivation mutant TCM 69 (Figure S2J) lost ability for 1 production (Figure 2L), and produced a new compound 21 (Chart 2; Figure S15). The compound was isolated and its molecular formula was established as C52H74O17Cl2 on the basis of HRFABMS (m/z 1063.4264, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe; calculated, 1063.4201). In comparison with 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1, the oxygenated sp3methine carbon at C-18 in 1was reduced to a methylene [\u03b4H 1.67 (dd, J = 7.0, 14.0, H-18), 1.83 (dd, J = 7.0, 14.0 Hz, H-18); \u03b4C 26.4 (t, C-18)] in 21, and the doublet methyl in 1 was replaced by triplet methyl [\u03b4H 0.95 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, Me-19), \u03b4C 10.0, Me-19] in 21. In addition, H-19 was found to have strong HMBC correlations to C-17 (oxygenated sp3 methine) and C-18 (methylene). These data undoubtedly supported the lack of a hydroxyl group at C-18 in 21, confirming that TiaP1 forms the hydroxyl group at C-18. Subsequently, fermentation of the tiaP2-inactivation mutant TCM54 (Figure S2K) led to the production of 4 major compounds 22-25 and a minor compound 26 (Figure 2M). The compounds 22, 23, 25, and 26 were isolated and characterized by HRFABMS and full NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC) spectral analyses (Tables S3 and S4; Figure S16 for 22, Figure S17 for 23, Figure S18 for 25, Figure S19 for 26). By analyzing their 1H and 13C NMR data, the presence of an additional singlet methyl group and the absence of an oxygenated sp3 methylene carbon were found in compounds 22, 23, and 25 (Chart 2), when comparing to compounds 15-18, previously characterized from the tiaG2mutant TCM64. In HMBC spectra of these compounds, proton signals of the additional methyl group showed strong correlations to C-1 and C-3, indicating that the methyl group was located at C-20. These data confirmed that the hydroxyl group at C-20 was missing in compounds 22, 23, and 25. In comparison with 25, one triplet methyl and one methylene were missing in 26; however, two additional doublet methyls [\u03b4H 0.96 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, Me-19), 0.97 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, Me-20), \u03b4C 19.6 (q, Me-19), 18.3 (q, Me-20)] and one methine [\u03b4H 2.09 (dd, J = 7.0, 14.0 Hz, H-18), \u03b4C 30.5 (d, C-18)] were found in 26, suggesting an isopropyl group at C-17 in 26. Consistent with this, H-19 showed strong HMBC correlations to C-17, C-18, C-20, and H-20 showed strong HMBC correlations to C-17, C-18, C-19, specifically supporting the structure of 26. The structure of compound 24 (Chart 2) was deduced from its molecular weight via HPLC-MS analysis (m/z 641.4, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe). These new products 22-26 lack both hydroxyl groups at C-20 and C-18. Since TiaP1 was unequivocally demonstrated to be the C-18 hydroxylase, we concluded that TiaP2 specifically catalyzed the hydroxylation at C-20. Genes Putatively Involved in Regulation, Resistance, and Transportation and Genes with Unknown Functions. The tiaR1 gene encodes a putative LuxR class regulator [pfam00196]. Regulators of this family often appear as transcriptional activators in bacteria.62 Our preliminary data indicated that TiaR2 may function as a negative regulator in 1 biosynthesis (Figure 2E). Four genes, tiaT1-T4, are putative resistance and transporter genes found in the tia-gene cluster. The deduced product of tiaT1 displays high similarity to EmrB/QacA subfamily of drug resistance transporter, belonging to the Major Facilitator Super-family (MFS), a large and diverse group of secondary transpor-ters. TiaT2 is homologous to Na/H antiporters, key transporters in maintaining the pH of actively metabolizing cells. TiaT3 and TiaT4 exhibit high homology to members of the ABC transpor-ter superfamily involved in the transport of a wide variety of different compounds. Since most of 1 and its analogues are present in the fermentation broths of wild type and the mutants, TiaT1-T4 may constitute an efficient system to transport the synthesized metabolites out of the cells. However, the exact roles of TiaT1-T4 and their involvements in 1 transport remain uncertain. The tiaI product shows similarity to ATP-dependent superfamily I DNA and RNA helicases [COG3973]. Its function for 1 biosynthesis is not clear. Biochemical Characterization of the Halogenase TiaM. Our in vivo inactivation experiment suggests that TiaM is the requisite halogenase probably catalyzing a dihalogenation reac-tion in 1 biosynthesis. To verify TiaM function in vitro, tiaM was 1101 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE amplified from NRRL 18085 genomic DNA and heterologously overexpressed in E. coli as an N-(His)6-fused soluble protein (Figure S21). Purified recombinant TiaM exhibited a yellow color, indicating the presence of a flavin cofactor. Heat denatura-tion of purified TiaM released the noncovalently bound cofactor, which was identical to authentic FAD inHPLC analysis (data not shown). Since no discrete ACP was found in the tia gene cluster, we suppose that TiaM probably utilize a free small molecule as a substrate. The TiaM activity was probed using orsellinic acid (27), a homo-orsellinic acid (28) mimic (Chart 3), and 9, a compound isolated from the tiaMmutant, as putative substrates. The reduced flavin cofactor was provided by in situ reduction of FAD by SsuE from E. coli.63 No conversions were found for 27 (data not shown). In contrast, two new products were formed in an in vitro assay comprising TiaM, 9, SsuE, FAD, NADH, and NaCl (Figure 4A). Conversion rates under assayed conditions for the two products were 33% and 10% (Figure 4A), respec-tively. LC-MS analyses of the assay revealed that the two products had molecular weights of m/z 1045.5 ([M \u00fe Na]\u00fe) and m/z 1079.4 ([M \u00fe Na]\u00fe), consistent with mono-and dichlorinated 9, respectively. Subsequently, the first product (29) was isolated from a large-scale TiaM reaction and char-acterized by HRFABMS and full NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC) spectral analyses (Tables S3 and S4; Figure S20). Chart 3. Chemical Structures for Orsellinic Acid (27) and Homo-orsellinic Acid (28) Figure 4. HPLC analyses of TiaM biochemical assays. (A) A standard TiaM assay comprising 26 \u03bcM 9, 2.9 \u03bcMTiaM, 0.22 \u03bcM SsuE, 0.1 mM FAD, 4 1102 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE On the basis of HRFABMS (m/z 1045.4490, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe; calculated, 1045.4540), the molecular formula of 29 was estab-lished as C52H75O18Cl. In comparison with the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 9, a sp2 quaternary carbon (\u03b4C 105.8, s) was missing in 29. The proton signals linking to the remaining sp2 quaternary carbon showed HMBC correlations to C-2000, C-4000, and C-8000, indicating presence of H-6000. Consistent with this, H-8000 showed HMBC correlation to C-6000. These data undoubtedly confirmed the enzymatic product to be 29 (Scheme 1; Tables S3 and S4, Figure S20). The latter product was characterized to be 1 by comparing both retention time and molecular weight with 1 authentic standard (Figure 4H). In the absence of SsuE, TiaM retained about 60% activity, with 20% conversion to 29 and 4% conversion to 1 (Figure 4B), suggesting the presence of a presumable unknown co-purified flavin reductase.25 However, absence of any component of TiaM, FAD, NADH, or Cl-led to almost complete abolishment of the new products formation (Figure 4C-F). In the next assay, TiaM was able to transform 29 to 1 at a conversion rate of 45% (Figure 4G). These experiments demonstrated that TiaM catalyzed twice chlorinations on 9 to afford 29 and 1, in a sequential manner, first to chlorinate at C-4000 and then at C-6000 of the 9 aromatic moiety (Scheme 1). Further-more, we tested TiaM tolerance to different halide donors. Under assayed conditions, TiaM was capable of brominating 9 to afford 26% of 30 (m/z 1089.4, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe) and 1.4% of 31 (m/z 1169.3, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe) (Figure 4I). TiaM was also capable of converting 29 to 32 (m/z 1123.4, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe), with a very low conversion rate (1%, Figure 4J). However, F-and I-were not detected as halide donors for TiaM (data not shown). Tiacumicin Derivatives and Their Antibacterial Activities. We isolated 17 new compounds from 7 mutants. To evaluate biological activities of these 1 analogues, we measured their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against 4 indicator strains, including E. coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. Our results showed that only the compounds 9, 12, 14, 20, and 21 still preserved the antimicrobial activities (Chart 2 and Table 2), implying that the 2-O-methyl-4-O-homodichloro-orsellinate-\u03b2-D-rhamnose moiety was critical for antimicrobial activities. However, our results indicate that the hydroxyl group at C-18 and the two chlorines at C-4000 and C-6000 are less important for 1 bioactivity against S. aureus and E. faecalis, since compounds 21 and 9 have near equipotent activity as 1 for these two strains. \u2019DISCUSSION Tiacumicin B (1) is a halogenated macrolide belonging to polyketides, which comprise a large family of natural products with diverse biological activities and pharmacological properties. In this study, we reported the cloning and sequencing analysis of the tiacumicin B (1) biosynthetic gene cluster fromD. aurantiacum NRRL 18085 and the elucidation of key biosynthetic steps by both in vivo genetic and in vitro biochemical characterizations. Isolation and structural elucidation of 18 biosynthetic intermedi-ates from 7 key tia-gene inactivated mutants provided clues to dissect the biosynthetic pathway for 1. The tiacumicinone (13) is biosynthesized through a complex type I PKS system comprising tiaA1-tiaA4 (Figure 3A), evidenced by the complete abolish-ment of 1 production in tiaA1-inactivation mutant (Figure 2F). Interestingly, the production of 26 (Chart 2) by TCM54 indicates a promiscuous loading module capable of utilizing both propionyl-and isobutyryl-CoA as starter units in TiaA1. The substrate promiscuity of loading modules was previously demon-strated for DEBS.38 By in vivo gene inactivation, TiaG1 and TiaG2 were character-ized as the 5-C-methyl-D-rhamnosyl-transferase and the 2-O-methyl-D-rhamnosyltransferase, respectively. Interestingly, the production of the new compound 10, bearing a mannose instead of a rhamnose moiety, by the mutant TCM57, indicates that TiaG2 can also accept a GDP-D-mannose as a surrogate substrate. Similarly, the production of 19 by TCM55 indicates that TiaG1 can also accept GDP-D-rhamnose as a non-native sugar donor. The inherent substrate flexibility is often seen for natural products GTs, making GT a versatile tool for natural product diversification.64,65 TiaG1 and TiaG2 are potential newmembers in this toolbox. However, both GT-mutants TCM57 and TCM64 can only produce monoglycosylated products, indicating that TiaG1 and TiaG2 exhibit no cross implementing functions and suggesting that TiaG1 and TiaG2 are stringent in the regiochem-istry. The catalytic order of TiaG1 and TiaG2 could be arguably inferred from our results. The relative amounts of 12 and 14 produced by the tiaG1mutant TCM57 are quite small compared to that of 11 and 13 (Figure 2H), meaning that very little glycosylation of 11 or 13 is catalyzed by TiaG2 in the absence of TiaG1. In contrast, relative large amounts of 15-18 are accumu-lated by the tiaG2 mutant TCM64 (Figure 2I), and no produc-tions of 11 were detected, indicating that 11 was efficiently glycosylated by TiaG1 in the absence of TiaG2. Thus, we propose that TiaG1 catalysis probably occurs before TiaG2 (Figure 3A). Production of 19 by TCM55 unequivocally confirmed TiaS2 as a sugarC-methyltransferase (Figure 2J andFigure 3C).C-methyla-tion often occurs on the nucleotide sugar stage before glycosyl-transfer in natural product biosynthesis, exemplified by the in vitro biochemical characterization ofC-methyltransferases TylC3 for TDP-L-mycarose and EvaC for TDP-L-epivancosamine.66,67 However, timing for TiaS5-catalyzed sugar-O-methylation remains uncertain. In most cases, sugar O-methylation happens as a tailoring step;64,68 however, case exists for direct O-methylation of NDP-sugars prior to glycosyl coupling.69,70 Production of Table 2. MIC Values for 1 Analogues 1103 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja109445q |J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1092\u20131105 Journal of the American Chemical Society ARTICLE 20 by TCM53 reveals TiaS6 to be a sugar O-acyltransferase (Figure 2K and Figure 3C). However, more biochemical experiments are required to determine the timing (before or after glycosyl coupling) for TiaS6-catalyzed O-acylation. Interestingly, compounds 16-18 and 23-25 (Chart 2), which are different in the length of the sugar acyl-side chains, were produced by TCM64 and TCM54, suggesting that the acyltransferase TiaS6 has broad substrate specificities toward acetyl-, propionyl-, and isobutyryl-CoAs. Our gene inactivation experiments also established that TiaP1 and TiaP2 were the C-18 and C-20-hydroxylases, respectively. Production of both 11 and 13 by TCM57 (Figure 2H and Chart 2) indicates that hydroxylation at C-20 by TiaP2 probably is an early event in 1 biosynthesis. In contrast, the lack of a hydroxyl group at C-18 in the compounds 10-18 and 21-26 (Chart 2), suggests that TiaP1 catalyzes a tailoring step that occurs later in 1 biosynthesis. Interestingly, the absence of C-18 hydroxyl group in 20, produced by tiaS6-inactivatedmutant hints thatO-acylation by TiaS6 probably occurs before TiaP1 catalysis. In contrast, the presence of C-18 hydroxyl group in 19 and 9, produced by TCM55 (\u0394tiaS2) and TCM50 (\u0394tiaM), respectively, indicates that TiaP1 preserves its activity when changing the C-11 sugar moiety and removing halogens in the aromatic ring. The production of 9 by TCM50 suggests that TiaM was a dihalogenase. Indeed, our in vitro biochemical characterization confirmed that TiaM was capable of catalyzing sequential chlorina-tions on 9, first at the aromatic C-4000 to form 29, and then at C-6000 to furnish 1 biosynthesis. The monobrominated compound 30 (Scheme 1) was previously isolated from the wild-type producer.29 These data supported that first halogenation of TiaM catalysis exhibited an exclusive regioselectivity at C-4000 of the homo-orsellinic acid moiety in 9. Previously characterized bacterial halogenases, such as PltA,24 SgcC3,18 RebH,71 KtzQ, and KtzR72 catalyzed halogenations in early steps of natural product biosynthesis. Recently, eukaryotic halogenases ChlA25 and Rdc222,23 were reported for tailoring biosynthesis of DIF-1 (8) and radicicol (6), respectively. The demonstration of 9, but not 27 (Chart 3), as a TiaM substrate suggests that TiaM catalysis occurs after the TiaF-catalyzed coupling of unmodified homo-orsellinic acid with the 2-O-methyl-D-rhamnose residue. Thus, we concluded that TiaM functioned as a tailoring enzyme involved in 1 biosynthesis. To our best knowledge, this repre-sents the first example of a tailoring halogenase of prokaryotic origin. Our results also hint that tailoring halogenations are probably embedded in the biosynthesis of other prokaryotic natural products, such as calicheamicin \u03b31 I (2) and avilamycin A (4),18,20 which harbor very similar aromatic moieties as 1 (Chart 1) and lack obvious discrete ACP encoding genes in their biosynthetic gene clusters. Conclusively, the cloning and sequencing of the tia gene cluster from D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085 lays a foundation for further understanding of the biosynthetic logic for the antibiotic tiacumicin B of great clinical promise. The genetic manipulation of the tia gene cluster allows elucidation of key biosynthetic steps for 1 production, including glycosylations, hydroxylations, sugar C-methylation and O-acylation, and halogenations. On the basis of our data, the key transformations featuring 1 biosynthesis are outlined in Figure 3A. The accumulation of 19 biosynthetic intermediates or shunt products (9-26, Chart 2; and 29, Scheme 1), among which 17 (except 23, also known as tiacumicin A,2 and 2016) were novel structures, reveals the potential of generating natural product diversity via genetic approach. Although none of the novel compounds exhibit better anti-bacterial activity than 1 (Table 2), they form a small library to have potentials for further studies on their inhibitory mechanism of RNA polymerase. Finally, biochemical demon-stration of TiaM as a tailoring enzyme adds knowledge to further understand nature's biohalogenation strategy. \u2019ASSOCIATED CONTENT bS Supporting Information.

        "The RNA polymerase inhibitor tiacumicin B is currently undergoing phase III clinical trial for treatment of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea with great promise. To understand the biosynthetic logic and to lay a foundation for generating structural analogues via pathway engineering, the tiacumicin B biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and characterized from the producer Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subsp. hamdenensis NRRL 18085. Sequence analysis of a 110 633 bp DNA region revealed the presence of 50 open reading frames (orfs). Functional investigations of 11 orfs by in vivo inactivation experiments, preliminarily outlined the boundaries of the tia-gene cluster and suggested that 31 orfs were putatively involved in tiacumicin B biosynthesis. Functions of a halogenase (TiaM), two glycosyltransferases (TiaG1 and TiaG2), a sugar C-methyltransferase (TiaS2), an acyltransferase (TiaS6), and two cytochrome P450s (TiaP1 and TiaP2) were elucidated by isolation and structural characterization of the metabolites from the corresponding gene-inactivation mutants. Accumulation of 18 tiacumicin B analogues from 7 mutants not only provided experimental evidence to confirm the proposed functions of individual biosynthetic enzymes, but also set an example of accessingmicrobial natural product diversity via genetic approach.More importantly, biochemical characterization of the FAD-dependent halogenase TiaM reveals a sequentially acting dihalogenation step tailoring tiacumicin B biosynthesis.",

        "Tiacumicin B (1, Chart 1), also known as lipiarmycin A3, PAR-101, OPT-80, Difimicin and Fidaxomicin,1 is produced by Dactylosporangiumaurantiacum subsp. hamdenensisNRRL 18085,2 Actinoplanes deccanensis ATCC 21983,3,4 Micromonospora echi-nospora subsp. armeniaca,5 and Catellatospora sp. Bp3323-81.6 Tiacumicin B (1) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic against various Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, especially diarrhea-associated Clostridium difficile, with low minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values.7-10 Recently, tiacumicin B was demonstrated to be effective against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with no cross-resistance to rifampicin,6 and was also shown to exhibit good anticancer activities.11 Currently, tiacumicin B is undergoing phase III clinical trials, developed by Optimer Phar-maceuticals, Inc., for the treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI).",

        "Tiacumicin B is shown to be statistically superior to vancomycin, the only FDA approved product for CDI, in better global cure rates and fewer relapses (http://www.optimerpharma.com).Additionally, tiacumicin B exhibits no toxicities in animal studies,12 making it a promising drug candidate. However, the mechanism of tiacumicin action is not well understood. Tiacumicin B is found as a bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitor and inhibits the holoenzyme better than the core enzyme.3,13 Recent genetic and biochemical studies reveal that tiacumicin B blocks the early step of open-promoter-complex formation, suggesting a newmechanism of transcription inhibitor action.14",
        "The chemical structure of tiacumicin B (1) was elucidated by extensive spectral analyses and was finally confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies.2,4,15-17 Tiacumicin B belongs to a family of novel 18-membered macrocyclic glycosides and contains an unsaturated macrolide core scaffold, two modified D-rhamnose residues, and a dichlorinated homo-orsellinic acidmoiety (Figure 1). Tiacumicin B is a member of halogenated natural products which comprise diverse structures (Chart 1, 1-8), exemplified by enediynes (calicheamicin \u03b31 I, 2, and C-1027, 3),18,19 ortho-somycins (avilamycin A, 4),20 macrolides (chlorothricin, 5, and radicicol, 6),21-23 hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides (pyoluteorin, 7),24 and small hormone molecules (DIF-1, 8),25 displaying a wide range of biological activities including anti-bacterial, antitumor, and quorum sensing properties. Recently, a variety of nature's strategies for biohalogenation have been demonstrated both biochemically and structurally.26-28 For example, SgcC3 and PltAwere shown to catalyze chlorinations on substrates tethered with discrete carrier proteins in C-1027 (3) and pyoluteorin (7) biosynthesis,19,24 respectively. ChlA-catalyzed dichlorinations on a free smallmolecule were demonstrated to be a tailoring strategy for DIF-1 (8) biosynthesis.25 Structurally, 1, 2, 4, and 5 contain a similar halogenated aromatic moiety of polyketide origin as 8; however, the halogenation strategies for these mole-cules remain uncharacterized.",
        "The structure-activity relationship studies reveal that tiacu-micin B with an R-hydroxyl group at C-18 is more potent than its S-congener for antibacterial activity.16 Up to date, most 1 analogues were isolated from the producing strains by varying fermentation conditions;16,17,29 chemical efforts to diversify 1were limited to make 1 benzylidene acetal derivatives for anticancer evaluations.11 The unavailability of 1 genetic locus impeded the alternative to access 1 structural diversity via pathway engineer-ing. To this end, herein we report the cloning and characteriza-tion of the intact 1 biosynthetic gene cluster fromD. aurantiacum NRRL 18085. The sequencing of the entire tia gene cluster allows the assignment of functions to deduced gene products, and paves the way to genetic and biochemical characterization of the 1 biosynthetic pathway. Structural elucidation of eighteen 1 analogues accumulated from 7 key tia gene-inactivation mutants not only provides experimental evidence to confirm the proposed functions of individual biosynthetic enzymes, but also sets an example of accessing microbial natural product diversity via genetic approach.

        "Genomic Library Construction and Screening. A genomic library ofD. aurantiacumNRRL 18085 was constructed in SuperCos1 by using the Gigapack III Gold Packaging Extract system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). A 0.55 kb halo-probe for halogenase was amplified by adopting previously reported primers 50-TTCCCSCGSTACCASATCGGSGAG-30 (forward) and 50-GSGGG-ATSWMCCAGWACCASCC-30 (reverse),32 and confirmed by cloning, sequencing, and blasting.

        "Cloning and Sequencing of the Tiacumicin B Gene Cluster from D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085. We set out to probe the 1 biosynthetic gene cluster by PCR with degenerate primers targeting type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and halogenase genes. We retrieved a halogenase probe (halo-probe) and two PKS probes I and II (see Experimental Section for details) by PCR. Subsequently, the digoxigenin-(DIG)-labeled halo-probe and PKS-probes I and II were utilized to screen approximately 2000 clones of a SuperCos1-based genomic library of D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085. Using the PKS-probes I and II, the same set of 16 positive cosmids (pCSG1-pCSG16) was isolated, of which 8 cosmids were also positive with the halo-probe. Next, the target PKS I allele was inactivated by a genetic system previously developed for the producer D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085.35 The resulting mutant lost the ability to produce 1, suggesting its involvement in 1 biosynthesis. Finally, restriction analyses of the 16 positive cosmids revealed that they overlapped in a DNA region of approximately 105 kb (Figure S1). End-sequencing of the left-hand side of pCSG10 suggests the need for further extension to cover the entire 1 gene cluster. Therefore, additional chromosomal walking was performed from the left end of pCSG10 by PCR (Figure 1), resulting in the identification of two positive clones, namely, pCSG17 and pCSG18 (Figure S1). Three overlapping cosmids, pCSG5, pCSG6, and pCSG10, were entirely sequenced by a shotgun approach. For covering the entire tia-gene cluster, approximately 5 kb DNA fragment in pCSG17, upstream of the left-end of pCSG10 (Figure S1), was further analyzed by subcloning and sequencing. Finally, a total of 110 633 bp contiguous sequence was determined to encompass the complete tia-gene cluster.

The production level was comparable to the wild-type strain, suggesting that orf(-1) is beyond the tia-gene cluster. In contrast, the inactivation of a putative glycosyltransferase (GT)-encoding gene tiaG1 (Figure S2B), immediately downstream of orf(-1), led to the abolish-ment of 1 production and the accumulation of new products (Figure 2H), confirming that tiaG1 plays an essential role in 1 biosynthesis. The downstream boundary of the tia-gene cluster is intriguing. From the bioinformatic analysis, the deduced products of orfs1-15 exhibit no significant functions putatively related to 1 biosynthesis (Table 1). The inactivation of orf1 (Figure S2C), encoding a putative short chain dehydrogenase, led to themutant TCM73 exhibiting no effects on 1 production (Figure 2D), clearly excluding its role in 1 biosynthesis. Subsequently, the gene tiaR2, encoding a putative ArsR family transcriptional regulator, im-mediately next to orf1, was also inactivated (Figure S2D). The resulting mutant TCM72 still produced 1 (Figure 2E), however, at a slightly enhanced level, arguably indicating that tiaR2 is a putative negative regulator. These experimental results, together with the functional assignment of individual orfs by bioinformatic analyses, suggest that the tia gene cluster presumably contains 31 orfs flanked by tiaG1 and tiaR2, and spans a DNA region of approximately 83 kb (Figure 1, Table 1).",

The deduced product of tiaB contains characteristic type I PKS domains and is supposed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of the aromatic moiety (homo-orsellinic acid) in 1. Bioinformatic analysis shows that TiaB carries PKS domains for ketosynthase (KS), AT, dehydratase (DH), keto reductase (KR) and ACP, and displays the highest sequence similarity to ChlB1, a 6-methyl-salicyclic acid synthase.21,40 However, the DH domain lacks the conserved motif (HxxxGxxxxP) for activity,41 and the characteristic Rossmann-fold of NADP(H) binding motif is not identified in the KR domain, implying that both KR and DH domains in TiaB are inactive. Indeed, formation of the homo-orsellinic acid moiety in 1 does not require functional KR and DH domains (Figure 3B). However, distinct from orsellinic acid synthases CalO5 and AviM,18,20 TiaB may utilize an unusual propionyl-CoA but not acetyl-CoA as a starter unit, leading to the formation of homo-orsellinic acid moiety.

TiaM contains a common Rossmann motif GxGxxG at the N-terminal for FAD-and NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases, and a conserved motif WxWxIP putatively for halide-binding.43 TiaM shows the highest similarity to the halogenase CrpH (39% identity) in cryptophycin biosynthesis.44 Since there are two chlorines in 1, TiaM probably catalyzes a dihalogenation reaction. To verify this hypothesis, the tiaM gene was inactivated, resulting in themutant TCM50 (Figure S2F). HPLC-analysis of fermentation broth of TCM50 revealed the production of a major product (Figure 2G). The product was isolated and its chemical formula was determined to be C52H76O18, lacking two chlorines, by the HRFABMS data (m/z 1011.4938, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe; calculated, 1011.4929). Full NMR characterization (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) clearly revealed the isolated compound to have the structure of 9 (Chart 2). Two additional proton signals [6.20 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-4000), 6.26 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-6000)] were present in 9 (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S3) when comparing with 1.2 In the HMBC spectrum of 9, these two proton signals showed strong correla-tions to C-2000, C-4000, C-8000, and to C-2000, C-6000, demonstrating their locations at C-6000 and C-4000, respectively.

        "Genes Putatively Involved in Precursor Supply of Starter and Extender Units. Two genes in the tia gene cluster, tiaC and tiaD, putatively encode E1-alpha and E1-beta subunits, two components of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogen-ase (BCDH) complex. BCDH complex is possibly involved in the generation of isobutyryl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and other acyl-CoA analogues by the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-branched-chain fatty acids derived from alpha-branched-chain amino acids.45 However, the tia gene cluster lacks the other components of the BCDH complex including a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), and a requisite alpha-branched-chain amino acid transaminase.46 The deduced product of tiaL gene displays high similarity to the propionyl-CoA carboxylase, probably catalyzing the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to form (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA.47 The genes tiaJ, tiaN, and tiaK are identified to encode for hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, crotonyl-CoA hydratase, and crotonyl-CoA carbox-ylase/reductase, respectively. These enzymes were recently eluci-dated to be involved in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway.48,49 Especially, the crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase is identified as a key enzyme and a marker for the presence of the ethylma-lonyl-CoA pathway.48 Thus, TiaJ, TiaN, and TiaK probably contribute to provide the ethylmalonyl-CoA extender unit for 1 PKS. The deduced product of tiaE shares high identity (61%) with NysE, a putative type II thioesterase (TE) in nystatin biosynthesis.50 In polyketide biosynthesis, Type II TE may func-tion as editing enzymes, likely to remove aberrant precursors.51 Thus, TiaE may be functional to promote the accuracy and efficiency of 1 PKS process.",

D-rhamnose was biosynthesized through sequential conversionofGDP-D-mannosebyGDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (Gmd) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose reduc-tase (Rmd).52 Interestingly, three putative Gmds, encoded by tiaS1, tiaS3, and tiaS4, were identified in the tia gene cluster. Both TiaS3 and TiaS4 displayed high sequence identity to NysDIII (60% and 70%, respectively), a characterizedGmd involved in themycosamine biosynthesis of polyene antibiotic nystatin.53TiaS1 shows the highest homology (58% identity) to a putative Gmd from Prochlorococcus marinus.54However, no specific Rmds are identified. SomeGmds are found to be bifunctional and are also able to catalyze the same stereospecific reduction like Rmds;52,55 we suppose that at least one of TiaS1, TiaS3, and TiaS4 is functional as a Rmd. TiaS2 contains two conserved domains, methyltransf_13 [pfam08421] at N-termi-nus and methyltransf_14 [pfam08484] at C-terminus, characteristic for bacterialC-methyltransferases, requisite for transformingGDP-D-rhamnose into GDP-5-methyl-D-rhamnose. TiaS5 shares 39% iden-tity with StfMIII, an O-methyltransferase involved in steffimycin biosynthesis.56 TiaS5 is probably responsible for biosynthesizing 2-O-methyl-D-rhamnose. TiaG1 and TiaG2 share 50% identity to each other and both display high similarities to NysDI and AmphDI, two characterized GDP-sugar dependent GTs from nystatin and amphotericin biosynthetic gene clusters.57 Additionally, TiaS6 is found to exhibit the closest homology to MppM, an isovaleryltrans-ferase, in the mannopeptimycins gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus.58 TiaS6 contains a conserved domain of acyltransfer-ase_3 [pfam01757] and probably is responsible for esterifying the 7-carbon sugar with small fatty acids. Upon these bioinformatic analyses, a pathway for sugar biosynthesis and modifications is proposed, as outlined in Figure 3C.",

Bothmutants lost the ability to produce 1 and accumulated novel products (Figure 2H,I). By fermentation of the tiaG1-mutant TCM57, 5 new products were isolated and 4 of them were structurally elucidated to be 11-14 (Chart 2), by HRFABMS and full NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC) spectral analyses (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S5 for 11, Figure S6 for 12, Figure S7 for 13, and Figure S8 for 14). Comparing with 1, signals of the 7-carbon sugar residue were missing in their 1H and 13CNMR spectroscopic data of compounds 11-14; consistent with this, the C-11 was found to shift upfield about 10 ppm (Tables S3 and S4). These data confirmed that compounds 11-14 lacked the 7-carbon sugar residue at C-11 (Chart 2). The molecular formula of compound 10 was estab-lished as C31H48O10 on the basis of HRFABMS (m/z 603.3110, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe; calculated, 603.3145). Comparingwith the compound 12, there were no signals for aromatic moiety in 10 (Figure S4). The doublet methyl group in 12 was also absent in 10. A unique oxygenated sp3methylene carbon [\u03b4H 3.79 (1H,m), 3.91 (1H,m), \u03b4C 60.9 t] was found in 10, and the C-50 in 10 was found to shift 3.2 ppm upfield (Tables S3 and S4), indicating that there was a hydroxyl group at C-60 in 10. Therefore, the structure was deduced to be 10 (Chart 2). Subsequently, 4 new products were isolated from the tiaG2-mutant TCM64 and were determined to be 15-18 (Chart 2). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 15-18 presented only one anomeric proton, suggesting the presence of a single sugar residue in these compounds. The anomeric proton showed strong HMBC correlation to C-11, and consistently, H-11 was found to have HMBC correlation to C-100 (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S9 for 15, Figure S10 for 16, Figure S11 for 17, and Figure S12 for 18). These data unequivocally established the glycosylation at C-11 and the sugar residue at C-20 was missing in 15-18.

In comparison with the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1, two singlet methyls and the linking quaternary carbon in 1 were missing in 19, instead, one doublet methyl [\u03b4H 1.13 (3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz, Me-600), \u03b4C 18.1 (q, Me-600)] and one methine [\u03b4H 3.28 (1H, dd, J = 6.5, 9.5 Hz, Me-500), \u03b4C 71.4 (d, Me-500)] were found in 19, suggesting the loss of a methyl group. In the HMBC spectrum of 19, the proton signals for the methyl doublet showed strong correlations to C-400 and C-500, indicating that the methyl group was located at C-500. The large 0H, 0H coupling constant (J = 9.5 Hz) of H-400 and H-500 in C-11 sugar moiety suggested that H-400 and H-500 adopted axial orientations in 19. In the NOESY spectrum of 19, the H-500 had correlation to axial oriented H-100, providing further support of the axial orientation of H-500. Thus, the compound was eluci-dated to have the structure of 19 (Chart 2), consistent with the prediction of TiaS2 as a sugar C-methyltransferase.

Both TiaP1 and TiaP2 contain the conserved O2 binding motif `LLxAGxxT' and the C-terminal heme binding site, `FGxGx-HxCxG', typical for CYPs.59 TiaP1 displays high similarities to LnmAandSfmO3, twoCYPs involved in leinamycin and saframycin A biosynthesis,60,61 respectively. TiaP2 resembles a putative CYP in Streptosporangium roseumDSM43021. The functions of TiaP1 and TiaP2 were investigated by in vivo inactivation experiments. The tiaP1 inactivation mutant TCM 69 (Figure S2J) lost ability for 1 production (Figure 2L), and produced a new compound 21 (Chart 2; Figure S15). The compound was isolated and its molecular formula was established as C52H74O17Cl2 on the basis of HRFABMS (m/z 1063.4264, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe; calculated, 1063.4201). In comparison with 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1, the oxygenated sp3methine carbon at C-18 in 1was reduced to a methylene [\u03b4H 1.67 (dd, J = 7.0, 14.0, H-18), 1.83 (dd, J = 7.0, 14.0 Hz, H-18); \u03b4C 26.4 (t, C-18)] in 21, and the doublet methyl in 1 was replaced by triplet methyl [\u03b4H 0.95 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, Me-19), \u03b4C 10.0, Me-19] in 21. In addition, H-19 was found to have strong HMBC correlations to C-17 (oxygenated sp3 methine) and C-18 (methylene). These data undoubtedly supported the lack of a hydroxyl group at C-18 in 21, confirming that TiaP1 forms the hydroxyl group at C-18. Subsequently, fermentation of the tiaP2-inactivation mutant TCM54 (Figure S2K) led to the production of 4 major compounds 22-25 and a minor compound 26 (Figure 2M). The compounds 22, 23, 25, and 26 were isolated and characterized by HRFABMS and full NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC) spectral analyses (Tables S3 and S4; Figure S16 for 22, Figure S17 for 23, Figure S18 for 25, Figure S19 for 26). By analyzing their 1H and 13C NMR data, the presence of an additional singlet methyl group and the absence of an oxygenated sp3 methylene carbon were found in compounds 22, 23, and 25 (Chart 2), when comparing to compounds 15-18, previously characterized from the tiaG2mutant TCM64. In HMBC spectra of these compounds, proton signals of the additional methyl group showed strong correlations to C-1 and C-3, indicating that the methyl group was located at C-20. These data confirmed that the hydroxyl group at C-20 was missing in compounds 22, 23, and 25. In comparison with 25, one triplet methyl and one methylene were missing in 26; however, two additional doublet methyls [\u03b4H 0.96 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, Me-19), 0.97 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, Me-20), \u03b4C 19.6 (q, Me-19), 18.3 (q, Me-20)] and one methine [\u03b4H 2.09 (dd, J = 7.0, 14.0 Hz, H-18), \u03b4C 30.5 (d, C-18)] were found in 26, suggesting an isopropyl group at C-17 in 26. Consistent with this, H-19 showed strong HMBC correlations to C-17, C-18, C-20, and H-20 showed strong HMBC correlations to C-17, C-18, C-19, specifically supporting the structure of 26. The structure of compound 24 (Chart 2) was deduced from its molecular weight via HPLC-MS analysis (m/z 641.4, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe). These new products 22-26 lack both hydroxyl groups at C-20 and C-18. Since TiaP1 was unequivocally demonstrated to be the C-18 hydroxylase, we concluded that TiaP2 specifically catalyzed the hydroxylation at C-20.",
        "Genes Putatively Involved in Regulation, Resistance, and Transportation and Genes with Unknown Functions. The tiaR1 gene encodes a putative LuxR class regulator [pfam00196]. Regulators of this family often appear as transcriptional activators in bacteria.62 Our preliminary data indicated that TiaR2 may function as a negative regulator in 1 biosynthesis (Figure 2E). Four genes, tiaT1-T4, are putative resistance and transporter genes found in the tia-gene cluster. The deduced product of tiaT1 displays high similarity to EmrB/QacA subfamily of drug resistance transporter, belonging to the Major Facilitator Super-family (MFS), a large and diverse group of secondary transpor-ters. TiaT2 is homologous to Na/H antiporters, key transporters in maintaining the pH of actively metabolizing cells. TiaT3 and TiaT4 exhibit high homology to members of the ABC transpor-ter superfamily involved in the transport of a wide variety of different compounds. Since most of 1 and its analogues are present in the fermentation broths of wild type and the mutants, TiaT1-T4 may constitute an efficient system to transport the synthesized metabolites out of the cells. However, the exact roles of TiaT1-T4 and their involvements in 1 transport remain uncertain. The tiaI product shows similarity to ATP-dependent superfamily I DNA and RNA helicases [COG3973]. Its function for 1 biosynthesis is not clear.",

Purified recombinant TiaM exhibited a yellow color, indicating the presence of a flavin cofactor. Heat denatura-tion of purified TiaM released the noncovalently bound cofactor, which was identical to authentic FAD inHPLC analysis (data not shown). Since no discrete ACP was found in the tia gene cluster, we suppose that TiaM probably utilize a free small molecule as a substrate. The TiaM activity was probed using orsellinic acid (27), a homo-orsellinic acid (28) mimic (Chart 3), and 9, a compound isolated from the tiaMmutant, as putative substrates. The reduced flavin cofactor was provided by in situ reduction of FAD by SsuE from E. coli.63 No conversions were found for 27 (data not shown). In contrast, two new products were formed in an in vitro assay comprising TiaM, 9, SsuE, FAD, NADH, and NaCl (Figure 4A). Conversion rates under assayed conditions for the two products were 33% and 10% (Figure 4A), respec-tively. LC-MS analyses of the assay revealed that the two products had molecular weights of m/z 1045.5 ([M \u00fe Na]\u00fe) and m/z 1079.4 ([M \u00fe Na]\u00fe), consistent with mono-and dichlorinated 9, respectively. Subsequently, the first product (29) was isolated from a large-scale TiaM reaction and char-acterized by HRFABMS and full NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC) spectral analyses (Tables S3 and S4; Figure S20).",

        "On the basis of HRFABMS (m/z 1045.4490, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe; calculated, 1045.4540), the molecular formula of 29 was estab-lished as C52H75O18Cl. In comparison with the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 9, a sp2 quaternary carbon (\u03b4C 105.8, s) was missing in 29. The proton signals linking to the remaining sp2 quaternary carbon showed HMBC correlations to C-2000, C-4000, and C-8000, indicating presence of H-6000. Consistent with this, H-8000 showed HMBC correlation to C-6000. These data undoubtedly confirmed the enzymatic product to be 29 (Scheme 1; Tables S3 and S4, Figure S20). The latter product was characterized to be 1 by comparing both retention time and molecular weight with 1 authentic standard (Figure 4H). In the absence of SsuE, TiaM retained about 60% activity, with 20% conversion to 29 and 4% conversion to 1 (Figure 4B), suggesting the presence of a presumable unknown co-purified flavin reductase.25 However, absence of any component of TiaM, FAD, NADH, or Cl-led to almost complete abolishment of the new products formation (Figure 4C-F). In the next assay, TiaM was able to transform 29 to 1 at a conversion rate of 45% (Figure 4G). These experiments demonstrated that TiaM catalyzed twice chlorinations on 9 to afford 29 and 1, in a sequential manner, first to chlorinate at C-4000 and then at C-6000 of the 9 aromatic moiety (Scheme 1). Further-more, we tested TiaM tolerance to different halide donors. Under assayed conditions, TiaM was capable of brominating 9 to afford 26% of 30 (m/z 1089.4, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe) and 1.4% of 31 (m/z 1169.3, [M \u00fe Na]\u00fe) (Figure 4I). TiaM was also capable of converting 29 to 32 (m/z 1123.4, [M\u00feNa]\u00fe), with a very low conversion rate (1%, Figure 4J). However, F-and I-were not detected as halide donors for TiaM (data not shown).",
        "Tiacumicin Derivatives and Their Antibacterial Activities. We isolated 17 new compounds from 7 mutants. To evaluate biological activities of these 1 analogues, we measured their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against 4 indicator strains, including E. coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. Our results showed that only the compounds 9, 12, 14, 20, and 21 still preserved the antimicrobial activities (Chart 2 and Table 2), implying that the 2-O-methyl-4-O-homodichloro-orsellinate-\u03b2-D-rhamnose moiety was critical for antimicrobial activities. However, our results indicate that the hydroxyl group at C-18 and the two chlorines at C-4000 and C-6000 are less important for 1 bioactivity against S. aureus and E. faecalis, since compounds 21 and 9 have near equipotent activity as 1 for these two strains.",
        "\u2019DISCUSSION",
        "Tiacumicin B (1) is a halogenated macrolide belonging to polyketides, which comprise a large family of natural products with diverse biological activities and pharmacological properties. In this study, we reported the cloning and sequencing analysis of the tiacumicin B (1) biosynthetic gene cluster fromD. aurantiacum NRRL 18085 and the elucidation of key biosynthetic steps by both in vivo genetic and in vitro biochemical characterizations. Isolation and structural elucidation of 18 biosynthetic intermedi-ates from 7 key tia-gene inactivated mutants provided clues to dissect the biosynthetic pathway for 1. The tiacumicinone (13) is biosynthesized through a complex type I PKS system comprising tiaA1-tiaA4 (Figure 3A), evidenced by the complete abolish-ment of 1 production in tiaA1-inactivation mutant (Figure 2F). Interestingly, the production of 26 (Chart 2) by TCM54 indicates a promiscuous loading module capable of utilizing both propionyl-and isobutyryl-CoA as starter units in TiaA1. The substrate promiscuity of loading modules was previously demon-strated for DEBS.38",
        "By in vivo gene inactivation, TiaG1 and TiaG2 were character-ized as the 5-C-methyl-D-rhamnosyl-transferase and the 2-O-methyl-D-rhamnosyltransferase, respectively. Interestingly, the production of the new compound 10, bearing a mannose instead of a rhamnose moiety, by the mutant TCM57, indicates that TiaG2 can also accept a GDP-D-mannose as a surrogate substrate. Similarly, the production of 19 by TCM55 indicates that TiaG1 can also accept GDP-D-rhamnose as a non-native sugar donor. The inherent substrate flexibility is often seen for natural products GTs, making GT a versatile tool for natural product diversification.64,65 TiaG1 and TiaG2 are potential newmembers in this toolbox. However, both GT-mutants TCM57 and TCM64 can only produce monoglycosylated products, indicating that TiaG1 and TiaG2 exhibit no cross implementing functions and suggesting that TiaG1 and TiaG2 are stringent in the regiochem-istry. The catalytic order of TiaG1 and TiaG2 could be arguably inferred from our results. The relative amounts of 12 and 14 produced by the tiaG1mutant TCM57 are quite small compared to that of 11 and 13 (Figure 2H), meaning that very little glycosylation of 11 or 13 is catalyzed by TiaG2 in the absence of TiaG1. In contrast, relative large amounts of 15-18 are accumu-lated by the tiaG2 mutant TCM64 (Figure 2I), and no produc-tions of 11 were detected, indicating that 11 was efficiently glycosylated by TiaG1 in the absence of TiaG2. Thus, we propose that TiaG1 catalysis probably occurs before TiaG2 (Figure 3A).",
        "Production of 19 by TCM55 unequivocally confirmed TiaS2 as a sugarC-methyltransferase (Figure 2J andFigure 3C).C-methyla-tion often occurs on the nucleotide sugar stage before glycosyl-transfer in natural product biosynthesis, exemplified by the in vitro biochemical characterization ofC-methyltransferases TylC3 for TDP-L-mycarose and EvaC for TDP-L-epivancosamine.66,67 However, timing for TiaS5-catalyzed sugar-O-methylation remains uncertain. In most cases, sugar O-methylation happens as a tailoring step;64,68 however, case exists for direct O-methylation of NDP-sugars prior to glycosyl coupling.69,70 Production of",

        "20 by TCM53 reveals TiaS6 to be a sugar O-acyltransferase (Figure 2K and Figure 3C). However, more biochemical experiments are required to determine the timing (before or after glycosyl coupling) for TiaS6-catalyzed O-acylation. Interestingly, compounds 16-18 and 23-25 (Chart 2), which are different in the length of the sugar acyl-side chains, were produced by TCM64 and TCM54, suggesting that the acyltransferase TiaS6 has broad substrate specificities toward acetyl-, propionyl-, and isobutyryl-CoAs.",
        "Our gene inactivation experiments also established that TiaP1 and TiaP2 were the C-18 and C-20-hydroxylases, respectively. Production of both 11 and 13 by TCM57 (Figure 2H and Chart 2) indicates that hydroxylation at C-20 by TiaP2 probably is an early event in 1 biosynthesis. In contrast, the lack of a hydroxyl group at C-18 in the compounds 10-18 and 21-26 (Chart 2), suggests that TiaP1 catalyzes a tailoring step that occurs later in 1 biosynthesis. Interestingly, the absence of C-18 hydroxyl group in 20, produced by tiaS6-inactivatedmutant hints thatO-acylation by TiaS6 probably occurs before TiaP1 catalysis. In contrast, the presence of C-18 hydroxyl group in 19 and 9, produced by TCM55 (\u0394tiaS2) and TCM50 (\u0394tiaM), respectively, indicates that TiaP1 preserves its activity when changing the C-11 sugar moiety and removing halogens in the aromatic ring.",
        "The production of 9 by TCM50 suggests that TiaM was a dihalogenase. Indeed, our in vitro biochemical characterization confirmed that TiaM was capable of catalyzing sequential chlorina-tions on 9, first at the aromatic C-4000 to form 29, and then at C-6000 to furnish 1 biosynthesis. The monobrominated compound 30 (Scheme 1) was previously isolated from the wild-type producer.29 These data supported that first halogenation of TiaM catalysis exhibited an exclusive regioselectivity at C-4000 of the homo-orsellinic acid moiety in 9. Previously characterized bacterial halogenases, such as PltA,24 SgcC3,18 RebH,71 KtzQ, and KtzR72 catalyzed halogenations in early steps of natural product biosynthesis. Recently, eukaryotic halogenases ChlA25 and Rdc222,23 were reported for tailoring biosynthesis of DIF-1 (8) and radicicol (6), respectively. The demonstration of 9, but not 27 (Chart 3), as a TiaM substrate suggests that TiaM catalysis occurs after the TiaF-catalyzed coupling of unmodified homo-orsellinic acid with the 2-O-methyl-D-rhamnose residue. Thus, we concluded that TiaM functioned as a tailoring enzyme involved in 1 biosynthesis. To our best knowledge, this repre-sents the first example of a tailoring halogenase of prokaryotic origin. Our results also hint that tailoring halogenations are probably embedded in the biosynthesis of other prokaryotic natural products, such as calicheamicin \u03b31 I (2) and avilamycin A (4),18,20 which harbor very similar aromatic moieties as 1 (Chart 1) and lack obvious discrete ACP encoding genes in their biosynthetic gene clusters.",
        "Conclusively, the cloning and sequencing of the tia gene cluster from D. aurantiacum NRRL 18085 lays a foundation for further understanding of the biosynthetic logic for the antibiotic tiacumicin B of great clinical promise. The genetic manipulation of the tia gene cluster allows elucidation of key biosynthetic steps for 1 production, including glycosylations, hydroxylations, sugar C-methylation and O-acylation, and halogenations. On the basis of our data, the key transformations featuring 1 biosynthesis are outlined in Figure 3A. The accumulation of 19 biosynthetic intermediates or shunt products (9-26, Chart 2; and 29, Scheme 1), among which 17 (except 23, also known as tiacumicin A,2 and 2016) were novel structures, reveals the potential of generating natural product diversity via genetic approach. Although none of the novel compounds exhibit better anti-bacterial activity than 1 (Table 2), they form a small library to have potentials for further studies on their inhibitory mechanism of RNA polymerase. Finally, biochemical demon-stration of TiaM as a tailoring enzyme adds knowledge to further understand nature's biohalogenation strategy.",
