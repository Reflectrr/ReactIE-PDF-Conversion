Cadicamo,[a] Jacques Courtieu,[b] Hai Deng,[a] Abdelkrim Meddour,*[b] and David O'Hagan*[a] Dedicated to Professor Heinz G. Floss on the occasion of his 70th Birthday Introduction In 1986, a group from Merck reported that Streptomyces cat-tleya had the rare capacity to biosynthesise organofluorine me-tabolites.[1] The toxin fluoroacetate (1) and the antibiotic 4-fluo-rothreonine (2) were isolated and identified as secondary me-tabolites of this organism. Biosynthesis studies have since re-vealed some of the details of the biosynthetic pathway to the organofluorine natural products of S. cattleya, and these are summarised in Scheme 1.[2\u00b15] Fluoroacetaldehyde (6) has been identified as the last common biosynthetic intermediate to both fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine.[2,5] Cell-free extracts of S. cattleya are able to efficiently convert fluoroacetaldehyde to fluoroacetate, and an NAD-dependant aldehyde dehydro-genase capable of catalysing this reaction has been isolated and characterised.[6] This enzyme had a clear preference for flu-oroacetaldehyde over acetaldehyde as a substrate and would appear to mediate the final transformation in fluoroacetate bi-osynthesis in the organism. The enzyme responsible for the transformation of fluoroacetaldehyde to 4-fluorothreonine has also been characterised.[7] This is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependant transaldolase that converts fluoroacetaldehyde and l-threonine to 4-fluorothreonine and acetaldehyde. This novel PLP-dependant enzyme does not utilise glycine as the amino acid donor, and it is interesting that for every molecule of 4-fluorothreonine that is biosynthesised, S. cattleya sacrifices a molecule of l-threonine, its amino acid analogue. The evolu-tionary significance of this interconversion of threonines is not clear, but it presumably confers some advantage to the organ-ism's survival. The most intriguing enzyme on the fluorometabolite biosyn-thesis pathway in S. cattleya is 5\u2019-fluoro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine syn-thase (5\u2019-FDAS), the first committed enzyme on the pathway and the one responsible for converting inorganic fluoride to organic fluorine.[8] The enzyme mediates a reaction between [a] C.

Current understanding of the metabolites and enzymes involved in S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM; 4) and fluoride ion to generate 5\u2019-fluoro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine (5\u2019-FDA; 5). This enzyme has re-cently been purified to homogeneity and it is the first native fluorination enzyme to have been isolated.[9] An amino acid sequence from the purified protein has allowed the gene to be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the fluorination enzyme has now been cloned and over-expressed in E. coli.[10] Nature has hardly developed a biochemistry of or-ganic fluorine compounds, and, as this enzymatic CNoneF bond formation is extremely rare, the enzyme is of mechanistic inter-est and has some biotechnological potential for the enzymatic synthesis of organofluorine compounds. In this context, 5\u2019-FDAS has recently been used to prepare labelled [18F]-5\u2019-FDA from 18FNone and has potential as a catalyst for CNone18F bond forma-tion for positron emission tomography (PET) applications.[11] Mechanistic information can be gleaned from a knowledge of the stereochemistry of the reaction process, and exploring the stereochemical course of biological fluorination has been a recent objective in our laboratory. We have already gained some insight into the stereochemical course of biological fluo-rination in whole-cell incubations of S. cattleya.[12] These experi-ments involved adding glycerol that was chiral by virtue of deuterium-isotope labelling in its pro-R hydroxymethyl arm. (1R,2R)-and (1S,2R)-[1-2H1]-glycerols 7a and 7b were added in separate experiments to the growth medium of S. cattleya in whole-cell incubations, and, after several days, the biosynthes-ised fluoroacetate, which carried a deuterium atom on the flu-oromethyl group, was recovered. Deuterium NMR in chiral liquid-crystalline solvent has proven to be an excellent method for the analytical determination of enantiomers of chiral [1H,2H,FC]-fluoromethyl groups and takes advantage of the quadrupolar nature of the deuterium nucleus.[12] By using this approach, the biosynthetically derived [2-2H1]-fluoroacetates were converted to their hexyl esters 8a and 8b and were ana-lysed. The enantiomers were easily resolved by 2H NMR in a chiral liquid-crystalline solvent. The stereochemical results, which are summarised in Scheme 2, indicated that the hydrox-ymethyl CNoneO bond of the pro-R arm of glycerol was converted to a CNoneF bond in the fluoroacetate with retention of configura-tion.[12] The enantiomeric excesses varied in the two comple-mentary experiments, largely as the isotope content in the de-rivatised fluoroacetates was low and the signal to noise ratio was low for the analytical method. Taking into account the knowledge that SAM synthase operates with an inversion of configuration,[13] this observation implies that the fluorination event proceeds with an inversion of configuration, that is, two inversions is an overall retention. However that study relied on the correct metabolic and stereochemical interpretation of events as the isotope on the glycerol was assumed to enter the glycolytic pathway, and then pass into the pentose phos-phate pathway prior to labelling ribose and becoming incorpo-rated into the ribose ring at the C-5\u2019 position of ATP and then SAM prior to fluorination. Further, the isotope was analysed in the fluoroacetate products and not in the immediate product of the enzymatic fluorination, and it was assumed that there was no configurational change during the latter stages of the pathway between 5\u2019-FDA and fluoroacetate. These assump-tions were a limitation of the whole-cell experiments. With the purified and over-expressed 5\u2019-FDAS now available,[10] it ap-peared appropriate to re-examine the stereochemical course of the fluorination event on the enzyme directly. We envisaged a preparation of (5\u2019R)-[5\u2019-2H1]-ATP 3a followed by its incubation with SAM synthase to generate a sample of (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H1]-SAM 4a (Scheme 3). Treatment of this stereo-and Scheme 2. A summary of conclusions from a previous stereochemical study,[12] isotopically labelled SAM with fluoride ion in the presence of the fluorination enzyme (5\u2019-FDAS) should provide a sample of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA 5a, stereospecifically labelled at the C-5\u2019 posi-tion. With a knowledge that SAM synthase mediates a configu-rational inversion,[13] the resultant configuration at C-5\u2019 of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA in the coupled enzyme assay will allow the stereo-chemical course of the fluorination reaction to be deduced. The entire strategy depends on a reliable assay for determining the absolute stereochemistry at C-5\u2019 of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA. In this paper we describe how we have used 2H NMR in a chiral liquid-crystalline medium to determine the absolute stereo-chemistry of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA. Results and Discussion To succeed in this approach it was necessary to prepare a sample of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA of known stereochemical configura-tion at C-5\u2019 as a reference for the 2H NMR assay in chiral-liquid crystalline media. Our approach to the synthesis of the (5\u2019S) isomer of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA 5b, summarised in Scheme 4, was ini-tiated following the previously reported asymmetric reduction of aldehyde 9.[14, 15] LiAlD4 treatment with added 2-methylbu-tan-2-ol and lithium iodide gave alcohol 10 in a 4:1 ratio (60 % de) of diastereoisomeric products. It has previously been estab-lished that the major product is the (5\u2019R) diastereoisomer.[15] The (5\u2019S) isomer of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA was prepared from 11 after mesylation of (5\u2019R)-10 and then TBAF treatment. It is assumed that the substitution of the mesylate by the fluoride ion pro-ceeds with a stereochemical inversion of configuration. Aceto-nide deprotection then gave (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA. The synthetic sample of (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA was analysed by 2H NMR in a chiral liquid crystalline medium generated by dissolving poly-g-benzyl-l-glutamate (PBLG) in DMF.[16, 17] The resultant spec-trum is shown in Figure 1 a. It exhibits both the 2H NMR spec-trum of our mixture of diastereoismers and that of the solvent (DMF) at natural abundance level. The latter is made of three quadrupolar doublets centred on the chemical shift of the three possible isotopomers of DMF, that is, the isotopomer in which the deuterium is at the aldehydic position and the two isotopomers in which the deuterium is on the nonequivalent methyl groups. These six lines are labelled with an asterisk. The other doublets are attributed to our diastereoisomers (4:1), which are clearly resolved by the technique. The predom-inant (5\u2019S) isomer has a smaller quadrupolar splitting than the minor (5\u2019R) isomer. The signal of the (5\u2019S) compound is split into two components. This is due to the total spin\u00b1spin cou-pling, TDF, between the deuterium and the fluorine nuclei with TDF=2DDF + JDF. In this expression, JDF is the scalar coupling and DDF is the dipolar coupling. The (5\u2019R) compound does not show such fluorine deuterium coupling. This is due to the fact that, here, the scalar and the dipolar couplings are of opposite signs yielding, fortuitously, a null or almost null splitting. In order to explore the stereochemistry of the enzymatic process it was necessary to prepare a sample of stereospecifi-cally enriched [5\u2019-2H1]-ATP. The (5\u2019R) isomer of [5\u2019-2H1]-ATP was prepared from alcohol (5\u2019R)-11 by a modification of a previous-ly described procedure.[18, 19] The route is illustrated in Scheme 5 and proved relatively straightforward to execute. This route utilised a sample of 11 prepared as described above as a 4:1 mixture (60 % de) of (5\u2019R) and (5\u2019S) diastereoisomers. As there is no stereochemical inversion at C-5\u2019 during the con-version of 10 to ATP, the corresponding [5\u2019-2H1]-ATP is predom-Figure 1. 2H{1H} NMR spectra of a) synthetic (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H]-5\u2019-FDA (4:1 diastereoi-someric ratio) and b) (5\u2019R)-[5\u2019-2H]-5\u2019-FDA (4:1 diastereoisomeric ratio) prepared by using enzymatic fluorination. The natural abundance signals from DMF (three doublets centred at 8.01, 2.90 and 2.79 ppm) are labelled with an aster-isk. In these spectra, the chemical shift of the aldehydic deuterium of DMF (8.01 ppm) was used as an internal reference. Scheme 4. i) LiAlD4 + 2-methylbutan-2-ol/LiI, None78 8C in THF for 3 h (36%); inant in the (5\u2019R) diastereoisomer, also in a 4:1 ratio. With this material in hand it was necessary to catalyse its conversion from ATP to [5\u2019-2H1]-SAM by SAM synthase. This enzyme was partially purified from bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevi-sae).[20] The key experiment was carried out by treatment of (5\u2019R)-ATP with l-methionine, Mg2+ , K+ and fluoride ion in a coupled enzyme reaction with SAM synthetase and the fluori-nation enzyme.[8, 9] The resultant [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA was purified by preparative HPLC and was analysed by 2H NMR with identical conditions to those described for the reference sample. The 2H NMR spectrum is shown in Figure 1 b. Although the amount of material analysed from the enzyme study was relatively small (~0.40 mg), it is clear from the analysis that the predomi-nant diastereoisomer has the (5\u2019R) configuration, again with an approximate ratio of 4:1; this is consistent with the stereo-chemical purity of the original starting material. (5\u2019R)-[5\u2019-2H1]-ATP provides (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H1]-SAM after treatment with SAM syn-thase, therefore the observation that the product of the fluori-nation reaction gave (5\u2019R)-[5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA indicates that there have been two configurational inversions within the coupled enzyme assay. These experiments reinforce the earlier conclu-sion and show that the fluoride ion acts on the C5\u2019NoneS bond of SAM to mediate a configurational inversion during CNoneF bond formation. The result is consistent with an SN2 reaction mecha-nism operating during biological fluorination in S. cattleya and reinforces the conclusion made after the earlier whole-cell ex-periments with S. cattleya. An SN2 mechanism is also consistent with the recent X-ray structure of the fluorination enzyme.[10] These stereochemical conclusions have been drawn through the use of deuterium NMR in a chiral liquid-crystalline solvent. In such a solvent, enantiotopic or diastereotopic groups do not exhibit the same ordering properties due to the chirally orientated field. This differential ordering of enantiomers or di-astereoisomers results in a difference that is often very large in the order-sensitive NMR interactions, such as quadrupolar split-ting. The technique offers a powerful tool for examining the stereochemical course of enzymatic reactions with appropriate-ly labelled substrates. Experimental Section General methods : Air-and moisture-sensitive reactions were car-ried out under an inert atmosphere with oven-dried glassware (200 8C). All reagents of synthetic grade were used as supplied, if further purification was required, the procedures are detailed ref. [22]. Column chromatography was performed by using Merck Kieselgel 60 silica gel (230\u00b1400 nm mesh). NMR spectra were ob-tained by using a Varian Unity Plus 500, a Bruker Av-300 or a Varian Unity Plus 300. Melting points were determined by using a Gallenkamp Griffin MPA350.BM2.5 melting-point apparatus. Cation-exchange procedures were carried out on Dowex 50W (X8) resin with 50\u00b1100 mesh particles. High-and low-resolution mass spec-trometry (HRMS/LRMS) were performed with a Micromass LCT spectrometer (Manchester, UK). HPLC analysis was carried out by using a Varian series 9012 pump/9050 UV lamp; analytical HPLC was performed on a Hypersil ODS C-18 column, 5 mm (250 \u00ee 4.6 mm id); semipreparative HPLC was performed by using a Phe-nomenex Hypersil C-18 column, 5 mm (250 \u00ee 10 mm id). Liquid crystalline NMR sample preparation : PBLG (151 mg, MW. 70 000\u00b1150 000 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) was weighted into a 5 mm o.d. NMR tube. DMF (240 mL) was added, and the mixture was heated to 80\u00b1100 8C until complete dissolution of the polymer occurred. Chloroform (30 mL) and a solution of 5\u2019-FDA (0.3 to 2.0 mg) in DMF (40 mL) were introduced in the NMR tube. In order to homogenize the viscous mixture, the NMR tube was repeatedly centrifuged (20 \u00ee ) on a low speed (600 rpm) bench-top centrifuge, with the tube being turned upside-down between each centrifuga-tion. Deuterium NMR measurements in PBLG/DMF liquid crystal : 2H{1H} NMR spectra were recorded at 61.4 MHz on a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer equipped with a selective deuterium probe. The temperature was held at 330 K by a BVT3000 variable temperature unit. Proton broad-band decoupling was achieved by using the WALTZ-16 composite pulse sequence.

After evaporation of the organic solvent, the residue was dissolved in water (37.5 mL), and an aqueous solution of 50 % TFA (10 ml) was added.

Purification of SAM Synthase : Bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cere-vasiae) was grown in a conical flask (2 L) containing a defined medium (500 mL) consisting of yeast extract (0.9 %), peptone (1.8 %) and d-glucose (2 %). After incubation (37 8C, 200 rpm) for 12 h , the cells were harvested, washed with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.8) and then resuspended in the same buffer. A cell-free extract was prepared by sonication (5 \u00ee 1 min, 60 % duty cycle) and centrifugation of the cell debris (20 000g for 20 min at 4 8C). Typically the protein concentration was 3.5 mg mLNone1. The enzyme activity was partially purified by adding solid (NH4)2SO4 to the cell-free extract at 4 8C until 60 % saturation, followed by centrifuga-tion. The supernatant was adjusted to 80 % saturation with solid (NH4)2SO4, and the precipitate was collected after centrifugation. The pellet was dialysed in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.8) (12 h, ChemBioChem 2004, 5, 685 \u00b1 690 www.chembiochem.org \u00b9 2004 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The fractions containing SAM synthase were concentrated to 3 mL by using a 10 kDa Macrosep (Pall Folton) centrifugal concentrator. HPLC conditions for the SAM synthase/5\u2019-FDAS assay and purifi-cation for 5\u2019-fluoro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine (5): Partially purified SAM synthetase fractions (150 mL) were incubated at 37 8C for 6 h with ATP (20 mm, 50 mL), l-methionine (100 mm, 25 mL), MgSO4 (1m, 50 mL) and KCl (1m, 25 mL) in final volume of 0.2 mL. The over-ex-pressed 5\u2019-FDAS solution (3 mg mLNone1, 500 mL) and KF (2m, 200 mL) were then added, and the coupled enzyme reaction left at 37 8C for 12 h. Aliquots for HPLC analyses were treated at 95 8C (3 min), and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. An aliquot (20 mL) of the clear supernatant was injected onto a Hyper-sil 5 mm C-18 column (250 \u00ee 4.6 mm, Macherey\u00b1Nagel) equilibrated with KH2PO4 (50 mm) and acetonitrile (95:5 v/v). Runs were moni-tored by UV detection at 260 nm by gradient elution starting from KH2PO4 (50 mm) and acetonitrile (95:5 v/v) to a final mobile phase consisting of KH2PO4 (50 mm) and acetonitrile (80:20 v/v). Samples were introduced through a high-pressure injector fitted with a 100 mL loop, and the flow rate was maintained at 1.0 mL minNone1 with a total elution time of 20 min. The isotopically labelled sample of FDA derived from the enzymat-ic reactions was purified by semipreparative HPLC on a C-18 column (Phenomenex Hypersil 5, 250 \u00ee 10.00 mm, 5 mm) under the same conditions as described for analytical HPLC. Samples were in-troduced through a high-pressure injector fitted with a 1 mL loop, and the flow rate was maintained at 5.0 mL minNone1 with a total elu-tion time of 30 min.

        "Introduction",
        "In 1986, a group from Merck reported that Streptomyces cat-tleya had the rare capacity to biosynthesise organofluorine me-tabolites.[1] The toxin fluoroacetate (1) and the antibiotic 4-fluo-rothreonine (2) were isolated and identified as secondary me-tabolites of this organism. Biosynthesis studies have since re-vealed some of the details of the biosynthetic pathway to the organofluorine natural products of S. cattleya, and these are summarised in Scheme 1.[2\u00b15] Fluoroacetaldehyde (6) has been identified as the last common biosynthetic intermediate to both fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine.[2,5] Cell-free extracts of S. cattleya are able to efficiently convert fluoroacetaldehyde to fluoroacetate, and an NAD-dependant aldehyde dehydro-genase capable of catalysing this reaction has been isolated and characterised.[6] This enzyme had a clear preference for flu-oroacetaldehyde over acetaldehyde as a substrate and would appear to mediate the final transformation in fluoroacetate bi-osynthesis in the organism. The enzyme responsible for the transformation of fluoroacetaldehyde to 4-fluorothreonine has also been characterised.[7] This is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependant transaldolase that converts fluoroacetaldehyde and l-threonine to 4-fluorothreonine and acetaldehyde. This novel PLP-dependant enzyme does not utilise glycine as the amino acid donor, and it is interesting that for every molecule of 4-fluorothreonine that is biosynthesised, S. cattleya sacrifices a molecule of l-threonine, its amino acid analogue. The evolu-tionary significance of this interconversion of threonines is not clear, but it presumably confers some advantage to the organ-ism's survival.",
        "The most intriguing enzyme on the fluorometabolite biosyn-thesis pathway in S. cattleya is 5\u2019-fluoro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine syn-thase (5\u2019-FDAS), the first committed enzyme on the pathway and the one responsible for converting inorganic fluoride to organic fluorine.[8] The enzyme mediates a reaction between",

        "S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM; 4) and fluoride ion to generate 5\u2019-fluoro-5\u2019-deoxyadenosine (5\u2019-FDA; 5). This enzyme has re-cently been purified to homogeneity and it is the first native fluorination enzyme to have been isolated.[9] An amino acid sequence from the purified protein has allowed the gene to be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the fluorination enzyme has now been cloned and over-expressed in E. coli.[10] Nature has hardly developed a biochemistry of or-ganic fluorine compounds, and, as this enzymatic CNoneF bond formation is extremely rare, the enzyme is of mechanistic inter-est and has some biotechnological potential for the enzymatic synthesis of organofluorine compounds. In this context, 5\u2019-FDAS has recently been used to prepare labelled [18F]-5\u2019-FDA from 18FNone and has potential as a catalyst for CNone18F bond forma-tion for positron emission tomography (PET) applications.[11]",
        "Mechanistic information can be gleaned from a knowledge of the stereochemistry of the reaction process, and exploring the stereochemical course of biological fluorination has been a recent objective in our laboratory. We have already gained some insight into the stereochemical course of biological fluo-rination in whole-cell incubations of S. cattleya.[12] These experi-ments involved adding glycerol that was chiral by virtue of deuterium-isotope labelling in its pro-R hydroxymethyl arm. (1R,2R)-and (1S,2R)-[1-2H1]-glycerols 7a and 7b were added in separate experiments to the growth medium of S. cattleya in whole-cell incubations, and, after several days, the biosynthes-ised fluoroacetate, which carried a deuterium atom on the flu-oromethyl group, was recovered. Deuterium NMR in chiral liquid-crystalline solvent has proven to be an excellent method for the analytical determination of enantiomers of chiral [1H,2H,FC]-fluoromethyl groups and takes advantage of the quadrupolar nature of the deuterium nucleus.[12] By using this approach, the biosynthetically derived [2-2H1]-fluoroacetates were converted to their hexyl esters 8a and 8b and were ana-lysed. The enantiomers were easily resolved by 2H NMR in a chiral liquid-crystalline solvent. The stereochemical results, which are summarised in Scheme 2, indicated that the hydrox-ymethyl CNoneO bond of the pro-R arm of glycerol was converted to a CNoneF bond in the fluoroacetate with retention of configura-tion.[12] The enantiomeric excesses varied in the two comple-mentary experiments, largely as the isotope content in the de-rivatised fluoroacetates was low and the signal to noise ratio was low for the analytical method. Taking into account the knowledge that SAM synthase operates with an inversion of configuration,[13] this observation implies that the fluorination event proceeds with an inversion of configuration, that is, two inversions is an overall retention. However that study relied on the correct metabolic and stereochemical interpretation of events as the isotope on the glycerol was assumed to enter the glycolytic pathway, and then pass into the pentose phos-phate pathway prior to labelling ribose and becoming incorpo-rated into the ribose ring at the C-5\u2019 position of ATP and then SAM prior to fluorination. Further, the isotope was analysed in the fluoroacetate products and not in the immediate product of the enzymatic fluorination, and it was assumed that there was no configurational change during the latter stages of the pathway between 5\u2019-FDA and fluoroacetate. These assump-tions were a limitation of the whole-cell experiments. With the purified and over-expressed 5\u2019-FDAS now available,[10] it ap-peared appropriate to re-examine the stereochemical course of the fluorination event on the enzyme directly.",
        "We envisaged a preparation of (5\u2019R)-[5\u2019-2H1]-ATP 3a followed by its incubation with SAM synthase to generate a sample of (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H1]-SAM 4a (Scheme 3). Treatment of this stereo-and",
        "Scheme 2. A summary of conclusions from a previous stereochemical study,[12]",
        "isotopically labelled SAM with fluoride ion in the presence of the fluorination enzyme (5\u2019-FDAS) should provide a sample of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA 5a, stereospecifically labelled at the C-5\u2019 posi-tion. With a knowledge that SAM synthase mediates a configu-rational inversion,[13] the resultant configuration at C-5\u2019 of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA in the coupled enzyme assay will allow the stereo-chemical course of the fluorination reaction to be deduced. The entire strategy depends on a reliable assay for determining the absolute stereochemistry at C-5\u2019 of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA. In this paper we describe how we have used 2H NMR in a chiral liquid-crystalline medium to determine the absolute stereo-chemistry of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA.",
        "Results and Discussion To succeed in this approach it was necessary to prepare a sample of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA of known stereochemical configura-tion at C-5\u2019 as a reference for the 2H NMR assay in chiral-liquid crystalline media. Our approach to the synthesis of the (5\u2019S) isomer of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA 5b, summarised in Scheme 4, was ini-",
        "tiated following the previously reported asymmetric reduction of aldehyde 9.[14, 15] LiAlD4 treatment with added 2-methylbu-tan-2-ol and lithium iodide gave alcohol 10 in a 4:1 ratio (60 % de) of diastereoisomeric products. It has previously been estab-lished that the major product is the (5\u2019R) diastereoisomer.[15] The (5\u2019S) isomer of [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA was prepared from 11 after mesylation of (5\u2019R)-10 and then TBAF treatment. It is assumed that the substitution of the mesylate by the fluoride ion pro-ceeds with a stereochemical inversion of configuration. Aceto-nide deprotection then gave (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA. The synthetic sample of (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA was analysed by 2H NMR in a chiral liquid crystalline medium generated by dissolving poly-g-benzyl-l-glutamate (PBLG) in DMF.[16, 17] The resultant spec-trum is shown in Figure 1 a. It exhibits both the 2H NMR spec-trum of our mixture of diastereoismers and that of the solvent (DMF) at natural abundance level. The latter is made of three quadrupolar doublets centred on the chemical shift of the",
        "three possible isotopomers of DMF, that is, the isotopomer in which the deuterium is at the aldehydic position and the two isotopomers in which the deuterium is on the nonequivalent methyl groups. These six lines are labelled with an asterisk. The other doublets are attributed to our diastereoisomers (4:1), which are clearly resolved by the technique. The predom-inant (5\u2019S) isomer has a smaller quadrupolar splitting than the minor (5\u2019R) isomer. The signal of the (5\u2019S) compound is split into two components. This is due to the total spin\u00b1spin cou-pling, TDF, between the deuterium and the fluorine nuclei with TDF=2DDF + JDF. In this expression, JDF is the scalar coupling and DDF is the dipolar coupling. The (5\u2019R) compound does not show such fluorine deuterium coupling. This is due to the fact that, here, the scalar and the dipolar couplings are of opposite signs yielding, fortuitously, a null or almost null splitting.",
        "In order to explore the stereochemistry of the enzymatic process it was necessary to prepare a sample of stereospecifi-cally enriched [5\u2019-2H1]-ATP. The (5\u2019R) isomer of [5\u2019-2H1]-ATP was prepared from alcohol (5\u2019R)-11 by a modification of a previous-ly described procedure.[18, 19] The route is illustrated in Scheme 5 and proved relatively straightforward to execute. This route utilised a sample of 11 prepared as described above as a 4:1 mixture (60 % de) of (5\u2019R) and (5\u2019S) diastereoisomers. As there is no stereochemical inversion at C-5\u2019 during the con-version of 10 to ATP, the corresponding [5\u2019-2H1]-ATP is predom-",

        "inant in the (5\u2019R) diastereoisomer, also in a 4:1 ratio. With this material in hand it was necessary to catalyse its conversion from ATP to [5\u2019-2H1]-SAM by SAM synthase. This enzyme was partially purified from bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevi-sae).[20] The key experiment was carried out by treatment of (5\u2019R)-ATP with l-methionine, Mg2+ , K+ and fluoride ion in a coupled enzyme reaction with SAM synthetase and the fluori-nation enzyme.[8, 9] The resultant [5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA was purified by preparative HPLC and was analysed by 2H NMR with identical conditions to those described for the reference sample. The 2H NMR spectrum is shown in Figure 1 b. Although the amount of material analysed from the enzyme study was relatively small (~0.40 mg), it is clear from the analysis that the predomi-nant diastereoisomer has the (5\u2019R) configuration, again with an approximate ratio of 4:1; this is consistent with the stereo-chemical purity of the original starting material. (5\u2019R)-[5\u2019-2H1]-ATP provides (5\u2019S)-[5\u2019-2H1]-SAM after treatment with SAM syn-thase, therefore the observation that the product of the fluori-nation reaction gave (5\u2019R)-[5\u2019-2H1]-5\u2019-FDA indicates that there have been two configurational inversions within the coupled enzyme assay. These experiments reinforce the earlier conclu-sion and show that the fluoride ion acts on the C5\u2019NoneS bond of SAM to mediate a configurational inversion during CNoneF bond formation. The result is consistent with an SN2 reaction mecha-nism operating during biological fluorination in S. cattleya and reinforces the conclusion made after the earlier whole-cell ex-periments with S. cattleya. An SN2 mechanism is also consistent with the recent X-ray structure of the fluorination enzyme.[10]",
        "These stereochemical conclusions have been drawn through the use of deuterium NMR in a chiral liquid-crystalline solvent. In such a solvent, enantiotopic or diastereotopic groups do not exhibit the same ordering properties due to the chirally orientated field. This differential ordering of enantiomers or di-astereoisomers results in a difference that is often very large in the order-sensitive NMR interactions, such as quadrupolar split-ting. The technique offers a powerful tool for examining the stereochemical course of enzymatic reactions with appropriate-ly labelled substrates. Experimental Section",
        "General methods : Air-and moisture-sensitive reactions were car-ried out under an inert atmosphere with oven-dried glassware (200 8C). All reagents of synthetic grade were used as supplied, if further purification was required, the procedures are detailed ref. [22]. Column chromatography was performed by using Merck Kieselgel 60 silica gel (230\u00b1400 nm mesh). NMR spectra were ob-tained by using a Varian Unity Plus 500, a Bruker Av-300 or a Varian Unity Plus 300. Melting points were determined by using a Gallenkamp Griffin MPA350.BM2.5 melting-point apparatus. Cation-exchange procedures were carried out on Dowex 50W (X8) resin with 50\u00b1100 mesh particles. High-and low-resolution mass spec-trometry (HRMS/LRMS) were performed with a Micromass LCT spectrometer (Manchester, UK). HPLC analysis was carried out by using a Varian series 9012 pump/9050 UV lamp; analytical HPLC was performed on a Hypersil ODS C-18 column, 5 mm (250 \u00ee 4.6 mm id); semipreparative HPLC was performed by using a Phe-nomenex Hypersil C-18 column, 5 mm (250 \u00ee 10 mm id). Liquid crystalline NMR sample preparation : PBLG (151 mg, MW. 70 000\u00b1150 000 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) was weighted into a 5 mm o.d. NMR tube. DMF (240 mL) was added, and the mixture was heated to 80\u00b1100 8C until complete dissolution of the polymer occurred. Chloroform (30 mL) and a solution of 5\u2019-FDA (0.3 to 2.0 mg) in DMF (40 mL) were introduced in the NMR tube. In order to homogenize the viscous mixture, the NMR tube was repeatedly centrifuged (20 \u00ee ) on a low speed (600 rpm) bench-top centrifuge, with the tube being turned upside-down between each centrifuga-tion. Deuterium NMR measurements in PBLG/DMF liquid crystal : 2H{1H} NMR spectra were recorded at 61.4 MHz on a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer equipped with a selective deuterium probe. The temperature was held at 330 K by a BVT3000 variable temperature unit. Proton broad-band decoupling was achieved by using the WALTZ-16 composite pulse sequence.
