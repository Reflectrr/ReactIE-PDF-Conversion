Vosburg,[a, c] and Christopher T. Walsh*[a] Biosynthetic tailoring of nonribosomal peptide and polyketide natural products can enhance their biological activities.[1\u20133] Tai-loring enzymes can introduce alkyl, acyl, or glycosyl groups onto natural product scaffolds and can oxidize or halogenate biosynthetic intermediates. Chlorinated and brominated mole-cules make up more than 95% of the more than 4500 known halogenated metabolites.[4] Chloro and bromo substituents are frequently found on aromatic and heteroaromatic rings, and many terpene scaffolds are also brominated and chlorinated by marine microorganisms.[4\u20136] Halogenating enzymes discov-ered to date fall into two categories based on their utilization either of hydrogen peroxide (haloperoxidases) or molecular oxygen (halogenases) as required oxidants.[7\u201311] Haloperoxidas-es can contain either heme iron or a vanadate cofactor, thought to generate enzyme-bound hapohalite equivalents as proximal OCl or OBr.[7, 8] The O2-utilizing halogenases are typi-cally found embedded in biosynthetic gene clusters ; this sug-gests a tailoring role in specific natural product assembly. This second class of enzymes uses either FADH2 or non-heme Fe II to activate chloride or bromide oxidatively.[9\u201311] The flavoproteins work on electron-rich aromatic and heteroaromatic sub-strates.[9, 12] The FeII halogenases represent a new branch of the O2 and a-ketoglutarate-decarboxylating superfamily and are powerful enough to halogenate unactivated carbon centers on aminoac-yl groups tethered to nonribosomal peptide synthetase assem-bly lines.[10,11] Thus, the 4-Cl-l-Thr residue in the phytotoxic li-ACHTUNGTRENNUNGpo ACHTUNGTRENNUNGdepsipeptide syringomycin E (1) is generated by the non-heme FeII halogenase SyrB2 (Scheme 1).[10] Chlorination occurs on the threonyl skeleton only while it is linked via a thioester to a peptidyl carrier protein domain. Remarkably, the cyclopro-pane ring in the amino acid coronamic acid arises by a similar g-chlorination of an l-allo-Ile-S-protein by the halogenase CmaB.[11] The g-chloride is then displaced intramolecularly by a thioester enolate by action of CmaC. Therefore, the CmaB-mediated chlorination is cryptic in cyclopropane formation.[11] In surveying natural products in which biological chlorina-tion is likely to have occurred at an unactivated carbon center, the remarkable functionalization of the two prochiral methyl groups of leucine to yield the regio-and stereospecific genera-tion of a trichloromethyl group in the biosynthesis of the cya-nobacterial metabolites barbamide (2), dysidenin (3), and dysi-deathiazole (4 ; Scheme 2A) suggests analogies with the above FeII halogenases.[13,14] Indeed, the barbamide biosynthetic gene cluster has been sequenced and contains two genes (barB1 and barB2) that encode proteins homologous to SyrB2, but no activity has yet been reported.[13] barB1 and barB2 homologues have also been found in the dysidenin and dysideathiazole producers (dysB1/dysB2 ; one pair in each producer).[14] Only a few natural products contain bromine where biological bromi-nation might have occurred at an unactivated carbon site. One example is lyngbyaloside B (5 ; Scheme 2B),[15] which is also of cyanobacterial origin and could arise from bromination of an unactivated carbon on a biosynthetic precursor. Whether non-heme FeII halogenases are involved in the biosynthesis of bro-minated natural products is unknown. To evaluate whether the non-heme FeII family of enzymes can indeed carry out bromi-nation and iterative chlorinations at the same carbon site, we have further examined the activity of SyrB2. SyrB2 was shown to act on the threonyl group presented in thioester linkage on the peptidyl carrier protein domain of its partner protein SyrB1. 4-Cl-threonyl-S-SyrB1 was gently hydro-lyzed by addition of the thioesterase TycF and detected as the isoindole adduct (Figure 1A).[10,16] With an almost equimolar ratio of SyrB2/SyrB1, SyrB2 generated a new peak (Figure 1B) that coeluted with the isoindole derivative of authentic 4,4-diCl-Thr, synthesized as noted in the Experimental Section. Mass analysis of the new enzymatic product confirmed both the mass and isotope ratios of the diCl-l-Thr isoindole deriva-tive (calcd for [M+H]+ 392.0 (100%), 394.0 (71%); found 391.7 (100%), 394.1 (68%)). In addition, the ratio of the relative in-tensity of the peaks corresponding to 4-Cl-l-Thr and 4,4-diCl-l-Thr for the reaction run in the presence of [36Cl]None is doubled in the radioactivity detection channel (Figure 1B, trace c) when compared to the UV channel (Figure 1B, trace d) of the same reaction; this is in good agreement with the presence of two chloro substituents. Because the substrate for SyrB2 is a cova-lent aminoacyl-S protein and the chlorinated product(s) remain covalently tethered, kinetic analysis would be challenging. However, the released mono-and diCl-l-Thr products were ob-tained at a maximum ratio of about 0.38:1 diCl-l-Thr/Cl-l-Thr (Figure 1C). When comparing the ratio of diCl-l-Thr/Cl-l-Thr in Figure 1C and B, it can be seen that the ratio is higher for turnover to 4-Cl-l-Thr was observed at low SyrB2/SyB1 enzyme ratios. Inside the syringomycin-producing Pseudomonas syringae bacterial cell, the eight-module SyrE protein would constitute the rest of the assembly line to capture 4-Cl-l-Thr and install it as residue nine in the nonadepsipeptide natural product.[17] In this in vitro assay with purified SyrB1 and SyrB2, the mono-chlorothreonyl moiety stays tethered on the PCP domain of SyrB1; this allows SyrB2 to iteratively cleave the second CNoneH bond at carbon 4 and form an additional CNoneCl bond. The ab-sence of the dichlorinated Thr analogue of syringomycin in vivo could be due to a specific and rapid transfer of 4-Cl-l-Thr from SyrB1 to the SyrE protein, potentially performed by SyrC, a CmaE homologue,[11] and/or to the narrow specificity of the last condensation domain of SyrE, which catalyzes the incorpo-ration of the ninth amino acid (4-Cl-l-Thr) in the syringomycin peptide. SyrB2 was also shown to brominate l-Thr-S-SyrB1 in reac-tions performed with excess sodium bromide (Figure 2A). The new major peak coeluted with the isoindole derivative of au-thentic 4-Br-l-Thr, synthesized as noted in the Experimental Section. Mass analysis of the new enzymatic product confirmed both the mass and isotope ratios for the Br-l-Thr isoindole de-rivative (Figure 2B). The brominating activity of SyrB2 corre-lates well with the observation that bromosyringomycin E is formed in vivo when the producing strain is grown in the pres-ence of excess sodium bromide.[18] A small amount of 4-Cl-l-Thr was also produced; this is due to the presence of a small amount of chloride in the buffer (~10 mm from the HEPES solid). It is known that an equimolar amount of chloride is present in the SyrB2 enzyme preparation. As 20 mm SyrB2 was used, the total chloride concentration was therefore 30 mm. In comparison, 60 mm bromide was present in the reaction mix-ture. By assuming free exchange of bromide with chloride in Scheme 1. Biosynthesis of 4-Cl-l-Thr, a key component of syringomycin E (1). the enzyme prior to oxygen ex-posure, a preference for chloride versus bromide by a factor of 180 can be estimated by com-paring the peak intensities. An-other peak (peak 2), distinct from the remaining l-Thr, was also detected. Mass spectromet-ric analysis proved that this peak has an identical mass to a g-lac-tone derivative of the Br-l-Thr isoindole compound (Figure 2B). Formation of this lactone is an artifact of the derivatization pro-cedure that is performed at pH 8.0, as this side product is also observed when pure 4-Br-l-Thr is derivatized. The lactone is presumably formed by intramo-lecular displacement of bromide by the aminoacyl carboxylate. When the reaction was per-Figure 1. Biosynthesis of 4,4-diCl-l-Thr by the SyrB2 halogenase. A) Procedure for the preparation and derivatization of amino acids for HPLC analysis. B) Tra-formed under similar conditions with fluoride or iodide instead of bromide, no new products were formed. These results directly establish that the non-heme FeII super-family member SyrB2 can catalyze bromination and tandem chlorinations at the g-position of the threonyl-S-protein sub-strate. The dichlorinating activity is a strong predictor that the cyanobacterial homologues, BarB1/BarB2 and DysB1/ DysB2,[13,14] will iteratively chlorinate the pro-R unactivated methyl group of a leucyl-S-protein substrate all the way to a trichloromethyl group in the production of the cyanobacterial metabolites 2\u20134 (Scheme 2A). Whether non-heme FeII halogen-ases are involved in the biosynthesis of brominated natural products remains to be shown. However, results from the pres-ent study show that this is a possibility. The preference for chlorination so far observed in this class of enzymes could be due to the environment of the producing strain, in which chlo-ride is more abundant than bromide. Detection of the ability of SyrB2 to act as a dichlorinating and brominating enzyme will set the stage for mechanistic analysis on both the timing of halogenation(s) and proposed homolytic CNoneH cleavages and subsequent rebound mechanisms for ClC transfer from high-valent oxoiron[10,11] species as the same carbon site is succes-sively chlorinated. Experimental Section Chemical synthesis of 4,4-diCl-Thr : Dichloroacetaldehyde, which is not stable for prolonged storage, was prepared from diethyl acetal by the method of Lindholm et al.[19] A solution of lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS; 1m in THF, 2.3 mL, 2.3 mmol) was added to THF (3 mL) at None78 8C. A solution of Boc-Gly-OtBu (231 mg, 1 mmol) in THF (2 mL) was added dropwise. After 1 h at None78 8C, dichloroacetaldehyde (121 mL, 1.5 mmol) was added drop-wise. After 45 min (still only ca. 30% conversion by TLC), the reac-tion was quenched with saturated NH4Cl (7 mL), warmed to room temperature, and extracted with EtOAc (2K10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (1K10 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to give 0.5 g of a yellow oil. This oil was chromatographed on silica (10:1!2:1 hexanes/EtOAc) to remove the substantial amount of unreacted Boc-Gly-OtBu, pro-viding a yellow oil (58 mg) as the cleanest fraction. Further purifica-tion was difficult (C-18 preparatory HPLC, 40!55% MeCN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min), but afforded Boc-4,4-diCl-Thr-OtBu as a colorless film (8 mg, 2% overall yield). Rf=0.14 (hexanes/ Et2O 5:1, eluted twice); 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): d=5.67 (d, J= 8.4 Hz, 1H), 5.16 (d, J=9.4 Hz, 1H), 4.66 (dd, J=1.8, 9.4 Hz, 1H), 4.32 (dd, J=1.8, 8.4 Hz, 1H), 1.49 (s, 9H), 1.46 (s, 9H). Boc-4,4-diCl-Thr-OtBu (8 mg, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in TFA (0.4 mL) and left at room temperature for 15 h. Volatiles were re-moved with a stream of nitrogen to give a tan film (6.9 mg, 100% yield). 4,4-DiCl-Thr was conveniently stored as its trifluoroacetic acid salt. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): d=6.12 (d, J=4.0 Hz, 1H), 4.42 (dd, J=4.0, 5.5 Hz, 1H), 4.16 (d, J=5.5 Hz, 1H). Chemical synthesis of 4-Br-l-Thr : Cbz-3,4-epoxy-Abu-OBzl was prepared by the method of Webb and Matthews.[20] AcOH (61 mL, 1.1 mmol) followed by LiBr (49 mg, 0.57 mmol) were added to a so-lution of Cbz-3,4-epoxy-Abu-OBzl (121 mg, 0.35 mmol) in anhy-drous THF (3.5 mL). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, then additional LiBr (0.1 g, 1 mmol) was added. After 21 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with hexanes/EtOAc (1:1, 10 mL), filtered through a short plug of silica, and concentrated in vacuo to give a yellow oil (0.3 g). The crude product was chromato-ACHTUNGTRENNUNGgraphed on silica (hexanes/EtOAc 2:1!1:1) to provide Cbz-4-Br-Thr-OBzl (150 mg, 100% yield). Rf=0.24 (hexanes/EtOAc 3:1); 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): d=7.35 (br s, 10H), 5.84 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 1H), 5.21 (s, 2H), 5.13 (s, 2H), 4.69 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 1H), 4.42 (br s, 1H), 3.47 (m, 2H), 3.37 (m, 1H); 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): d= 170.3, 157.1, 136.2, 135.3, 128.9, 128.8, 128.8, 128.6, 128.5, 128.4, 128.3, 72.0, 68.0, 67.7, 57.0, 34.8. HBr (48% aqueous, 1 mL) was added to Cbz-4-Br-Thr-OBzl (9.7 mg, 23 mmol). The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 80 8C for 8 h, cooled to room temperature, washed with Et2O (3K0.5 mL), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized to afford a colorless oil (7 mg, 100% yield). 4-Br-l-Thr was conveniently stored as its hydrobro-mide salt. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O); d=4.32 (m, 1H), 4.15 (dd, J= 2.5, 4.0 Hz, 1H), 3.52 (dd, 2H, J=2.5, 7.0 Hz). Protein preparations and assays : The SyrB1 and SyrB2 proteins were purified and assayed as previously described.[10] The masses of the released amino acids from SyrB1 were also determined as previously described.[10] The only altered parameters were the SyrB2-l-Thr-S-SyrB1 concentration and the use of NaBr instead of a chloride salt for the bromination experiments. To minimize chloride contamination, l-Thr-S-SyrB1 was desalted anaerobically in HEPES buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5), as previously described,[10] prior to incuba-tion with NaBr, O2, a-ketoglutarate and SyrB2. Details of the con-centrations that are different from previously described assays are in the figure legends.

The dichlorinating activity is a strong predictor that the cyanobacterial homologues, BarB1/BarB2 and DysB1/ DysB2,[13,14] will iteratively chlorinate the pro-R unactivated methyl group of a leucyl-S-protein substrate all the way to a trichloromethyl group in the production of the cyanobacterial metabolites 2\u20134 (Scheme 2A). Whether non-heme FeII halogen-ases are involved in the biosynthesis of brominated natural products remains to be shown. However, results from the pres-ent study show that this is a possibility. The preference for chlorination so far observed in this class of enzymes could be due to the environment of the producing strain, in which chlo-ride is more abundant than bromide. Detection of the ability of SyrB2 to act as a dichlorinating and brominating enzyme will set the stage for mechanistic analysis on both the timing of halogenation(s) and proposed homolytic CNoneH cleavages and subsequent rebound mechanisms for ClC transfer from high-valent oxoiron[10,11] species as the same carbon site is succes-sively chlorinated.",
        "Experimental Section Chemical synthesis of 4,4-diCl-Thr : Dichloroacetaldehyde, which is not stable for prolonged storage, was prepared from diethyl acetal by the method of Lindholm et al.[19] A solution of lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS; 1m in THF, 2.3 mL, 2.3 mmol) was added to THF (3 mL) at None78 8C. A solution of Boc-Gly-OtBu (231 mg, 1 mmol) in THF (2 mL) was added dropwise. After 1 h at None78 8C, dichloroacetaldehyde (121 mL, 1.5 mmol) was added drop-wise. After 45 min (still only ca. 30% conversion by TLC), the reac-tion was quenched with saturated NH4Cl (7 mL), warmed to room temperature, and extracted with EtOAc (2K10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (1K10 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to give 0.5 g of a yellow oil. This oil was chromatographed on silica (10:1!2:1 hexanes/EtOAc) to remove the substantial amount of unreacted Boc-Gly-OtBu, pro-viding a yellow oil (58 mg) as the cleanest fraction. Further purifica-tion was difficult (C-18 preparatory HPLC, 40!55% MeCN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min), but afforded Boc-4,4-diCl-Thr-OtBu as a colorless film (8 mg, 2% overall yield). Rf=0.14 (hexanes/ Et2O 5:1, eluted twice); 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): d=5.67 (d, J= 8.4 Hz, 1H), 5.16 (d, J=9.4 Hz, 1H), 4.66 (dd, J=1.8, 9.4 Hz, 1H), 4.32 (dd, J=1.8, 8.4 Hz, 1H), 1.49 (s, 9H), 1.46 (s, 9H). Boc-4,4-diCl-Thr-OtBu (8 mg, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in TFA (0.4 mL) and left at room temperature for 15 h. Volatiles were re-moved with a stream of nitrogen to give a tan film (6.9 mg, 100% yield). 4,4-DiCl-Thr was conveniently stored as its trifluoroacetic acid salt. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): d=6.12 (d, J=4.0 Hz, 1H), 4.42 (dd, J=4.0, 5.5 Hz, 1H), 4.16 (d, J=5.5 Hz, 1H). Chemical synthesis of 4-Br-l-Thr : Cbz-3,4-epoxy-Abu-OBzl was prepared by the method of Webb and Matthews.[20] AcOH (61 mL, 1.1 mmol) followed by LiBr (49 mg, 0.57 mmol) were added to a so-lution of Cbz-3,4-epoxy-Abu-OBzl (121 mg, 0.35 mmol) in anhy-drous THF (3.5 mL). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, then additional LiBr (0.1 g, 1 mmol) was added. After 21 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with hexanes/EtOAc (1:1, 10 mL), filtered through a short plug of silica, and concentrated in vacuo to give a yellow oil (0.3 g). The crude product was chromato-ACHTUNGTRENNUNGgraphed on silica (hexanes/EtOAc 2:1!1:1) to provide Cbz-4-Br-Thr-OBzl (150 mg, 100% yield). Rf=0.24 (hexanes/EtOAc 3:1); 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): d=7.35 (br s, 10H), 5.84 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 1H), 5.21 (s, 2H), 5.13 (s, 2H), 4.69 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 1H), 4.42 (br s, 1H), 3.47 (m, 2H), 3.37 (m, 1H); 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): d= 170.3, 157.1, 136.2, 135.3, 128.9, 128.8, 128.8, 128.6, 128.5, 128.4, 128.3, 72.0, 68.0, 67.7, 57.0, 34.8. HBr (48% aqueous, 1 mL) was added to Cbz-4-Br-Thr-OBzl (9.7 mg, 23 mmol). The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 80 8C for 8 h, cooled to room temperature, washed with Et2O (3K0.5 mL), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized to afford a colorless oil (7 mg, 100% yield). 4-Br-l-Thr was conveniently stored as its hydrobro-mide salt. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O); d=4.32 (m, 1H), 4.15 (dd, J= 2.5, 4.0 Hz, 1H), 3.52 (dd, 2H, J=2.5, 7.0 Hz). Protein preparations and assays : The SyrB1 and SyrB2 proteins were purified and assayed as previously described.[10] The masses of the released amino acids from SyrB1 were also determined as previously described.[10] The only altered parameters were the SyrB2-l-Thr-S-SyrB1 concentration and the use of NaBr instead of a chloride salt for the bromination experiments. To minimize chloride contamination, l-Thr-S-SyrB1 was desalted anaerobically in HEPES buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5), as previously described,[10] prior to incuba-tion with NaBr, O2, a-ketoglutarate and SyrB2. Details of the con-centrations that are different from previously described assays are in the figure legends.",
