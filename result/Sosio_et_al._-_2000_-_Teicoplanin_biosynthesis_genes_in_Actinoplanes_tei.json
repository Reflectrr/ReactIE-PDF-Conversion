In or-der to isolate the corresponding gene cluster, oligonucleotides derived from highly conserved motifs in peptide synthetases were used. These synthetic probes, and gene fragments derived from the balhimycin gene cluster of Amycolatopsis mediterranei, led to the identification of the likely teicoplanin gene cluster centered on a region of ca. 110 kb from the genome of Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, the teicoplanin producer. Partial nucleotide sequences identified partial ORFs likely to encode two glycosyltransferases, three P-450 monooxygenases and one ABC transporter. The corresponding genes have been found in other glycopeptide gene clusters. Furthermore, upstream to the peptide synthetase region a segment was identified with a remarkable similarity to the vanHAX operon, conferring resistance to glycopeptides in enterococci. Thus, in contrast to the other glycopeptide producers thus far analyzed, in A. teichomyceticus the genes for teicoplanin biosynthesis are closely linked to homologs of glycopeptide resistance commonly found in vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Figure 1. Structure of teicoplanin. The figure reports the structure 380 for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, was observed and has been increasing. Recently, some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus with de-creased susceptibility to glycopeptides have also been observed (John 1999). The increasing emergence of resistance to gly-copeptides has prompted the search for more effective derivatives of this class of antibiotics. The identific-ation of the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the glycopeptides chloroeremomycin and balhimycin (Solenberg et al. 1997; van Wageningen et al. 1998; Pelzer et al. 1999) and the selective expression or dis-ruption of some of these genes has been successfully exploited to produce hybrid glycopeptides (Solenberg et al. 1997) or pathway intermediates (Pelzer et al. 1999). These results are particularly significant since no pathway intermediates had been previously isol-ated from glycopeptide producing strains (Lancini & Cavalleri 1997). Thus, a contribution to the genera-tion of improved glycopeptides can also derive from the genetic manipulation of the biosynthesis genes. The isolation and preliminary characterization of the teicoplanin gene cluster is presented here. Identification of the teicoplanin gene cluster The biosynthesis of many peptide antibiotics occurs on a protein template through the action of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). These enzymes present a modular organization, where a different module is used for recognition and activation, covalent bind-ing and amide bond formation for each amino acid incorporated into the peptide. Three distinct do-mains within each module carry out these reactions (Marahiel 1997). The nature and number of the amino acids present in the teicoplanin peptide skeleton sug-gests that this antibiotic is synthesized by NRPS(s) consisting of seven modules. Recent genetic evidence from the chloroeremomycin (cep; van Wageningen et al. 1998) and balhimycin (bal; Pelzer et al. 1999; W. Wohlleben, pers. comm.) clusters indicates that glycopeptide formation occurs by the non-ribosomal route. In order to identify the teicoplanin biosynthesis gene cluster, we took advantage of two oligo probes, Pep6 and Pep8, derived from highly conserved mo-tifs present in NRPSs (Marahiel 1997) and de-signed for the identification of the corresponding genes in actinomycetes (Sosio et al. 2000). From an A.teichomyceticus library, 37 cosmids positive to both probes were identified. Restriction mapping and hy-bridization profiling allowed the grouping of ten of these cosmids into three different, unlinked contigs, encoding likely NRPS modules (data not shown). The other positive cosmids have not been organized into contigs yet. As seen with other actinomycetes (Sosio et al. 2000), A. teichomyceticus contains many more DNA fragments hybridizing to Pep6 and Pep8 than one would expect if this strain had the genetic po-tential to make only teicoplanin via the non-ribosomal system. In order to identify the teicoplanin biosynthesis genes among the multiple NRPS clusters, we used a series of probes derived from the bal and cep clusters. The bgtfA gene, derived from the bal cluster of Amy-colatopsis mediterranei and involved in one of the glycosylation steps (Pelzer et al. 1999), identified four positive cosmids previously grouped in a single con-tig. All together, these cosmids, denominated pAT9, pAT17, pAT32 and pAT42, contained two distinct fragments hybridizing to bgtfA. They covered a 68-kb region of the A. teichomyceticus chromosome, with each of the bgtfA-hybridizing fragments located on either side of a tight sequence of seven fragments hybridizing to Pep6 and Pep8, for a total of seven presumptive NRPS modules (Figure 2). One bgfA-positive fragment was also detected in each of three additional, unrelated, Pep6-and Pep8-positive cosmids (pAT5, pAT13 and pAT38). How-ever, the signals observed with bgtfA from the frag-ments of the contig of Figure 2 were stronger than those from pAT5, pAT13 and pAT38 (data not shown). Furthermore, none of these latter cosmids contained a sufficient number of Pep8-hybridizing fragments to be a likely candidate for teicoplanin biosynthesis. On the basis of the number of putative NRPS modules and the close relatedness to bgtfA, the contig of Fig-ure 2 appeared as the desired cluster. Interestingly, if the positive signals observed with bgtfA in pAT5, pAT13 and pAT38 do correspond to bona fide glyc-osyltransferase genes, then A. teichomyceticus would possess the genetic information for the synthesis of other glycosylated peptides. Organization of the tcp genes The contig delimited by pAT9, pAT17, pAT32 and pAT42 spanned a 68 kb segment of the A. teicho-myceticus genome, a size that may not be sufficient to contain all the genes required for teicoplanin bio-synthesis (van Wageningen et al. 1998). By genomic walking, this contig was extended by four more cos-381 Figure 2. Organization of the tcp cluster.
