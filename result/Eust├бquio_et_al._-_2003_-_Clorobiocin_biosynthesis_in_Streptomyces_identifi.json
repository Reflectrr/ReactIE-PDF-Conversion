However, due to their toxicity in eukaryotes, their poor solubility in water, and their low activity against gram-negative bacteria, clinical use of these antibiotics remains restricted [2]. Therefore, Alessandra S. Eusta\u0301quio,1 Bertolt Gust,2 Thomas Luft,1 Shu-Ming Li,1 Keith F.

Such new aminocoumarins may be developed by the methods ofGermany 2 Department of Molecular Microbiology combinatorial biosynthesis [16]. A functional analysis of biosynthetic genes for the aminocoumarins is a crucialJohn Innes Centre Norwich Research Park prerequisite for such approaches [17]. Our group has cloned and sequenced the biosyntheticColney, Norwich NR4 7UH United Kingdom gene clusters of novobiocin (nov) [18], coumermycin A1 (cou) [19], and clorobiocin (clo) [20]. A uniform nomen-clature for the genes in these clusters has recently been introduced [20], replacing the previous names of theSummary coumermycin biosynthetic genes (see GenBank entry AF235050 for old and new names).Clorobiocin (clo) and novobiocin (nov) are potent inhib-The characteristic aminocoumarin moiety is substi-itors of bacterial DNA gyrase.

The aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin (also spelled The aims of the present study were, first, to provide chlorobiocin), novobiocin, and coumermycin A1 (Figure functional proof for the role of clo-hal and cloZ in clorobi-1A) are potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase produced by ocin biosynthesis by gene inactivation, and, second, different Streptomyces strains [1\u20133].

Complementation of the clo-halNone Mutation To prove that only the inactivation of clo-hal was respon-sible for the loss of the chlorine atom, we complemented the clo-halNone mutant by expression of an intact copy of clo-hal under the control of the constitutive ermE* promoter, using the expression vector pUWL201 (plas-mid pAE-ha7). HPLC analysis showed a chromatogram identical to that of the wild-type, i.e., clorobiocin produc-tion could be fully restored by expression of clo-hal. The authenticity of the obtained peak was confirmed by negative-ion FAB MS analysis (mass [intensity]: 695 [100.0%], 696 [36.5%], 697 [30.2%], 698 [10.5%]). Combinatorial Biosynthesis: Expression of novO in the clo-halNone Mutant novO encodes a putative methyltransferase [18]. A very similar gene, couO, in the coumermycin A1 biosynthetic cluster [19] (Figure 1B) has been experimentally con-firmed to determine the methylation of C-8None of the amino-coumarin ring [21]. NovO shows 84% identity to CouO, and both proteins are of equal size (230 aa). The con-served motif III [LL(R/K)PGG(R/I/L)(L/I)(L/F/I/V)(I/L)] for S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent methyltransferases [31] is found in both gene products from amino acid 135 to 144 (CouO, LVKPGGAILN; NovO, LAKPGGAVLN). In order to produce a hybrid antibiotic, the putative methyltransferase gene novO was expressed in the clo-halNone mutant. For this purpose, novO was cloned into the replicative expression vector pUWL201 (see Experi-mental Procedures), placing it under the control of the constitutive ermE* promoter. The resulting construct, pTLO5, was introduced into the clo-halNone mutant by pro-toplast transformation. As control, the clo-halNone mutant was transformed with the empty vector pUWL201. Culture extracts of the two strains were analyzed by HPLC. In each case, three independent transformants were examined. While transformants containing the empty vector still produced novclobiocin 101 (data not shown), transformants containing the novO construct Figure 3.
