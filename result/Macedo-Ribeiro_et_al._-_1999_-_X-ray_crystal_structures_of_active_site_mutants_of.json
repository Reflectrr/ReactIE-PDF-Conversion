Hemrika 7 R. Renirie 7 R. WeverE.C. Slater Institute, Biocentrum, University of AmsterdamPlantage Muidergracht 12, 1018 TV AmsterdamThe NetherlandsAbstract The X-ray structures of the chloroperoxidasefrom Curvularia inaequalis, heterologously expressedin Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been determinedboth in its apo and in its holo forms at 1.66 and 2.11\u00c5 resolution, respectively. The crystal structures revealthat the overall structure of this enzyme remains nearlyunaltered, particularly at the metal binding site. At theactive site of the apo-chloroperoxidase structure aclearly defined sulfate ion was found, partially stabil-ised through electrostatic interactions and hydrogenbonds with positively charged residues involved in theinteractions with the vanadate in the native protein.The vanadate binding pocket seems to form a very rigidframe stabilising oxyanion binding. The rigidity of thisactive site matrix is the result of a large number of hy-drogen bonding interactions involving side chains andthe main chain of residues lining the active site. Thestructures of single site mutants to alanine of the cata-lytic residue His404 and the vanadium protein ligandHis496 have also been analysed. Additionally we deter-mined the structural effects of mutations to alanine ofresidue Arg360, directly involved in the compensationof the negative charge of the vanadate group, and ofresidue Asp292 involved in forming a salt bridge withArg490 which also interacts with the vanadate. The en-zymatic chlorinating activity is drastically reduced toapproximately 1% in mutants D292A, H404A andH496A. The structures of the mutants confirm the viewof the active site of this chloroperoxidase as a rigid ma-trix providing an oxyanion binding site. No largechanges are observed at the active site for any of theanalysed mutants. The empty space left by replacementof large side chains by alanines is usually occupied by anew solvent molecule which partially replaces the hy-drogen bonding interactions to the vanadate. The newsolvent molecules additionally replace part of the inter-actions the mutated side chains were making to otherresidues lining the active site frame. When this is notpossible, another side chain in the proximity of the mu-tated residue moves in order to satisfy the hydrogenbonding potential of the residues located at the activesite frame.Key wordsSulfate binding 7 Mutants 7 Phosphate 7Chloroperoxidase 7 VanadateAbbreviations CPO vanadium-containingchloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis 7APO recombinant apo-chloroperoxidase 7 HOLOrecombinant chloroperoxidase reconstituted withvanadate 7 H404A mutant of CPO where histidine404 was replaced by an alanine 7 H496A mutant ofCPO where histidine 496 was replaced by an alanine 7D292A mutant of CPO where aspartate 292 wasreplaced by an alanine 7 R360A mutant of CPOwhere arginine 360 was replaced by an alanine 7Sol solvent water moleculeIntroduction Haloperoxidases are enzymes which catalyse, in thepresence of hydrogen peroxide, the oxidation of halides(iodide, bromide and chloride) to their correspondinghypohalous acids:H2O2cHccX\u2013]H2OcHOX A diverse number of halogenated substrates can subse-quently be generated if the appropriate nucleophilic ac-ceptors are present. Three classes of 210 are presently known. One of these has been identifiedmainly in bacteria and contains no prosthetic group [1,2]. The remaining two classes comprise the heme-con-taining haloperoxidases [3, 4] and the vanadium-con-taining haloperoxidases [5\u20139]. Vanadium haloperoxi-dases bind a vanadate ion as a prosthetic group and in-clude the vanadium bromoperoxidases, mainly found inmarine algae, and the vanadium chloroperoxidases,mainly isolated from terrestrial fungi.The chloroperoxidase (CPO) secreted by the fungusCurvularia inaequalis [10] is a vanadium enzyme whichis involved in the production of hypochlorous acid(HOCl). HOCl is a strong bactericidal agent which mayoxidise plant cell walls [11], thus facilitating the pathog-enic role of the fungi. This enzyme is largely thermo-and chemostable, resisting to temperatures up to 707C and to oxidative inactivation in the presence of highconcentrations of peroxide. The crystal structure of na-tive CPO, a 67kDa protein, has been determined to2.03 \u00c5 resolution. It shows 2 four-helix bundles as themain structural motifs [12, 13]. These helical structureshave been proposed to be the major structural elementsof the protein, providing a strong stabilising hydro-phobic effect. The vanadium binding site is located atthe top of the C-terminal second four-helix bundle. Thevanadium coordination geometry is trigonal bipyrami-dal with three oxygen atoms in the equatorial plane(bond lengths about 1.65\u00c5), one apical oxygen atom(bond length 1.93\u00c5) and the other apical nitrogenatom from His496 (bond length 1.96\u00c5). The negativecharge is compensated by hydrogen bonding interac-tions with positively charged or hydrophilic residues lo-cated at the active site. Residues Lys353, Arg360,Ser402, Gly403 and Arg490 form hydrogen bonds withthe equatorial non-protein oxygens of vanadate. Eachof the three equatorial oxygen atoms is hydrogenbonded with at least one positively charged function,which means that these oxygen atoms are deproton-ated. The apical oxygen ligand has a bond length(1.93 \u00c5) which is in the range of a V(V)-hydroxyl bondand it is hydrogen bonded to nitrogen Nd1 of His404.This residue was proposed to function as the acid-basegroup in catalysis [12]. It has been shown [14] that bind-ing of hydrogen peroxide is inhibited when a group ofpKa larger than 5 is protonated. Thus, in the active pro-tein, the apical hydroxyl group is the H-donor and thenitrogen Nd1 of His404 is the H-acceptor of the hydro-gen bond. This residue was proposed to function as theacid-base group in catalysis.Sequence alignment between this vanadium chloro-peroxidase and the vanadium-containing bromoperoxi-dase from Ascophyllum nodosum [7], an enzyme whichis believed to have a similar catalytic mechanism [14],revealed high similarities in the metal binding site, butvery low similarities in the remaining regions. Surpris-ingly, those stretches of the sequence were also foundto be present in three families of acid phosphatases, in-dicating similarities in the anion-binding active sites ofall these enzymes [15, 16]. Furthermore, studies withthe apo-CPO produced recombinantly showed that itcan also function as an acid phosphatase, supportingthe hypothesis for the common architecture of the ac-tive sites from these enzymes [15].In order to further analyse the putative structuralimplications of the active site residues in cofactor bind-ing and peroxidase activity, we have determined thecrystal structure of active site mutants of CPO. Further,a correlation is made with the available preliminary ki-netic data obtained for each of these mutants. Further-more, we obtained data and solved the structure of therecombinant apo-chloroperoxidase (APO) at 1.66\u00c5 re-solution and determined the crystal structure of recom-binant chloroperoxidase reconstituted with vanadate(HOLO). Materials and methodsActivity measurements and mutantsEnzyme activity was determined by measuring the chlorination ofmonochlorodimedon (Ep20.2nM\u20131.cm\u20131 at 290nm). The reac-tion mixture contained 50mM citrate (pH5.0), 5mM NaCl,1 mM H2O2 and 100mM sodium vanadate. A detailed descriptionof the procedures to construct the mutants and their expressionwill be published elsewhere.Crystallisation and data collectionRecombinant apo-chloroperoxidase (APO) and mutants of CPO(D292A, H496A, H404A and R360A) were produced in a Sac-charomyces cerevisiae expression system as described previously[15]. The recombinant material tends to form crystalline precipi-tates when the crystallisation conditions determined for the nativecrystals are used [13]. Thus, the crystallisation conditions were al-tered in order to allow for slower equilibration rates. The crystalsfrom the recombinant material take 2\u20133 months to grow. Crystalsof D292A, H496A, R360A and recombinant holoenzyme(HOLO) grew at 47C by vapour diffusion. Hanging drops weremade from 3ml of protein solution [5mg/ml in 5mM MOPS (3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid) (pH7.5), 1mM vanadate], 3ml of precipitating buffer containing 1.7M ammonium sulfate, 0.1M Tris-H2SO4 (pH 8.0), 1mM sodium vanadate and 0.3ml 0.1M l-cysteine. Crystals from APO were prepared in a similar way froma precipitating buffer without sodium vanadate. The materialfrom the mutant H404A was largely insoluble when added to thecrystallisation buffer mentioned above. Thus, crystals fromH404A were obtained from 1.3M ammonium sulfate, 0.1M Tris-H2SO4 (pH 8.0)at 207C, after microseeding pre-equilibratedprotein drops with native protein crystals [13]. For the crystallisa-tion of the recombinant material it was always necessary to in-duce crystal nucleation. This was the main reason for the inclu-sion of l-cysteine as an additive, which crystallises as hexagonalplates in the crystallisation conditions used. All crystals belong tospace group R3 and all but the crystals from the mutant H404/Aare isomorphous with the native enzyme crystals. The H404A mu-tant crystals have a smaller unit cell when compared with the na-tive protein crystals.Room temperature diffraction data were collected on a Hen-drix/Lenfter X-ray image-plate system (Mar-Research, Hamburg,Germany) mounted on a Rikagu rotating anode generator oper-ating at 5.4kW (lCuKap1.5418\u00c5). Cryo data were collectedfrom a flash-cooled APO crystal [15% glycerol, 2.6M ammoniumsulfate, 0.15M Tris-H2SO4 (pH 8.0) on the wiggler beamline BW6at DORIS (DESY, Hamburg).

Crystalparameters and data collection statistics are depicted in Table1. Structure determination and crystallographic refinementThe crystallographic phases of the native enzyme structure[12, 13]were used as the starting phases for the refinement of the APO,HOLO, H496A, D292A and R360A. The initial phases for theH404A model were obtained after molecular replacement withAMoRe [19], using the native protein model [12, 13]. The modelswere refined with XPLOR [20] using the parameters derived byEngh and Huber [21], and model building was done with Turbo-FRODO [22]. For all the structures refined the Fobs were scaledto the Fcalc by using overall anisotropic B-factor refinement withXPLOR [20]. The equilibrium bond lengths and angles for thesulfate group were derived from sulfate refined in the crystalstructure of rubredoxin [23]. For the determination of the equili-brium bond lengths and angles for the vanadium metal site ineach of the structures described, electron density maps were cal-culated from refined models without vanadate and the vanadiumand oxygen atoms were optimally placed in the resulting 212 Table 2 Average r.m.s.d. val-ues of atomic coordinates (\u00c5)HOLO APO H404A D292A H496A R360A NATIVE[13] 0.281 0.309 0.421 0.357 0.256 0.228 HOLO 0.289 0.257 0.151 0.174 0.170 APO 0.379 0.328 0.212 0.233 H404 A 0.247 0.325 0.336 D292 A 0.236 0.260 H496 A 0.127 ence electron density. For these experimentally determined bonddistances and angles, force constants of 1000 and 200 kJ mol\u20131,respectively, were applied in the energy restrained refinement.The refinement statistics for the current models are shown inTable 1. In all structures, residues 1\u20133 and 578\u2013609 were excludedfrom the models because they were not visible in the electrondensity and are probably mobile or disordered. Residues 118\u2013127are also not defined in the electron density and thus their occu-pancies were set to zero. Additionally for some of the structures,residues 390\u2013395 were not clearly visible in the electron densityand the occupancy of their side chains was set to zero. Hydrogenbonds were calculated with HBPLUS [24]. Figures 1, 2 and 4\u20139were prepared with SETOR [25]. Figure 3A and B were pro-duced with INSIGHTII (Biosym/MSI) and Fig.3C and D wereprepared with GRASP [26].Results and discussionOverall structureSuperpositions of the refined protein models with thenative enzyme [13] revealed that, within the error limitsof the electron density maps, the overall backbonestructure remains unchanged. The root mean square(r.m.s.) deviations of the atomic coordinates betweenthe analysed structures are depicted in Table2. Themean positional errors, as estimated from the Luzzatiplots (Table1), are around 0.2\u00c5 and are likely to belower for the well-defined parts of the structure and forthe metal binding site.The residues in the active site are clearly defined inthe electron density maps for all models. Alterations inconformation are observed at the surface of mutantH404A. The crystals of this mutant display a smallercell, particularly a 8\u00c5 shorter c-axis. In the H404Amodel the side chains of residues Arg177 and Glu182are in a different conformation and do not form a saltbridge as observed in the native protein structure(Fig. 1). The different conformations of these residuesalter the crystal contacts, resulting in a smaller crystal-lographic unit cell and affecting its solubility under highsalt conditions. This does not seem to be a direct effectof the mutation of the active site residue His404, whichis relatively far from the site where these changes oc-cur. Instead it seems to result from an alteration of themain chain conformation of residues 123 and 124 whichare not defined in the electron density of any of thestructures. Residues Asp390-Pro396 are very flexible in the re-combinant protein material (as observed from the highB-values in this region), although their density wasclearly defined in the native protein structure. A similarsituation occurs for the protein segment including resi-dues Glu196-Gln220. Residues Asp390-Pro396 formpart of the broad channel leading to the anion-bindingsite. In the native protein structure, Pro395 and Phe393are in the immediate vicinity of the bound vanadate ion(see Figs.2, 3A). The side-chain of Lys394 points awayfrom the active site and is fixed by a hydrogen bondwith the main-chain carbonyl of Gly494. In the struc-tures of the mutants D292A and R360A, most of theseresidues are well defined in the electron density map.In the D292A mutant the main chain of residues suchas Phe393 deviates more than 7\u00c5 from its original po-sition in the native structure (Figs.2, 3B) and the sidechain of Lys394 is hydrogen bonded to Ala292O. Thedisplacement of the mentioned residues causes small al-terations in the conformations of the side chains ofGlu196, Phe218 and Gln220. In the APO form of therecombinant protein the well-defined electron densityindicates that this region assumes a conformation simi-lar to the native protein. In the R360A mutant the con-formation of the region containing residues Asp390-Pro396 is well defined and similar to the native CPO.For the mutants H404A, H496A and for the HOLOform of the recombinant native protein this region isnot well defined and it seems that the conformation ofthis protein stretch is alternating between the two mainobserved conformations. The movements of this regiongenerate considerable alterations of the electrostaticpotential distribution in the vicinity of the active sitechannel (Fig.3C, D). The amino acid residues includedin these regions are the same present in the native en-zyme and the nucleotide sequence in this region hasbeen reconfirmed. Thus the alterations in the confor-mations of these residues could be a consequence ofmisfolding of the protein in the Saccharomyces cerevi-siae expression system. As a result the protein ex-pressed recombinantly is more difficult to crystalliseand the crystals obtained have one or the other pre-dominant conformation.Oxyanion binding site in apo-chloroperoxidaseIn the initial difference electron density maps for therecombinant apoenzyme (APO), strong electron densi-ty (maximum four times the standard deviation of thedifference electron density map, 4s) was found at theactive site. The spherical electron density located closeto His496 was too strong to simply represent a 213 Fig. 1 Movements of the side chain of Arg177 in the mutantH404A alter the crystal contacts with the main chain of residues545\u2013546 of the symmetry related molecule. Schematic view of thecrystal contacts in the H404A mutant (red) in comparison to thecorresponding region in the native protein structure [13] (green)Fig. 2 Stereo view of the main chain and side chain conforma-tional changes in stretch Asp390-Pro396 in mutant D292A (green)superimposed with the native protein (red). The active site resi-dues displayed in blue and labelled in black correspond to mutantD292A. The vanadate ion is depicted in blue. In the APO proteinstructure this stretch of residues is similar to the native protein.The same is true for the mutant R360A, where only the confor-mation of the side chain Lys394 is altered. For the HOLO proteinstructure and for mutants H404A and H496A this region is notwell defined in the electron density and seems to alternate be-tween its conformation in the native protein [13] and in the mu-tant D292Awater molecule as previously modelled into the apo-chloroperoxidase after removal of the vanadium cofac-tor from the native protein [27]. Because no vanadatewas added to the recombinant protein before or duringcrystallisation, it was assumed that the species bound tothe metal cofactor binding site could be a tetrahedralsulfate anion, present in high concentrations in thecrystallisation buffer. The presence of a number of po-sitively charged residues, which usually form hydrogenbonds with the vanadate, probably compensate thestrong negative charge of the sulfate ion. This hypothe-sis was further confirmed in the electron density mapscalculated with the higher resolution data obtainedfrom frozen apo-CPO crystals. Thus, a tetrahedral sul-fate was built into the difference electron density andrefined. The final omit map for His496 and the sulfategroup close by is displayed in Fig.4 and shows clearlythe density for the bound oxyanion. Figure4A shows ascheme of the interactions between the sulfate and theactive site residues. The sulfur is 2.92\u00c5 away from theN\u03b52 of His496 and the sulfate is held by hydrogenbonds to the side chains of Lys353 (2.81\u00c5), Arg490(3.20 and 3.01\u00c5), Arg360 (3.01 and 3.24\u00c5) and Ser402(2.69 \u00c5) and additionally to the main chain nitrogenatoms of Gly403 (2.80\u00c5) and His404 (3.19\u00c5) and to awater molecule (2.53\u00c5). His496 is positioned by a hy-drogen bond to the side chain of Asp500 (2.93\u00c5). Mi-nor differences are observed in the positions of the am-ino acid side chains in the sulfate bound form whencompared to the native enzyme. Most deviations occurfor the side chains of His404, which gets closer to theapical oxygen of the bound oxyanion (2.99\u00c5), andHis496, which moves further away from the sulfate be-cause a covalent bond is no longer formed. ResiduesHis404 and His496 are within hydrogen bonding dis-tances to the sulfate ion as depicted in Fig.4A. In theabsence of the covalently bound vanadate, the sulfateion could possibly cause a pKa shift so that both 214 Fig. 3A-D View of the wide channel leading to the active site va-nadium. The vanadate is represented as red (A, B) or as yellowspheres (C, D). In this view the vanadate binding His496 comesfrom the right and is protected from the solvent. Ser402 comesfrom the back of the plane of the figures and Lys353, as well asresidues Trp350 and Phe397, are visible at the bottom. Arg360 islocated to the right side of the vanadate. His404, in this orienta-tion, is located at the top of the vanadate ion to its left. In framesA and B the Connolly surface is represented as small white dotsand the protein as a stick model (carbon, yellow; oxygen, red; ni-trogen, blue). In frames C and D the electrostatic potential in theimmediate vicinity of active site entrance is displayed from\u201315kBT (red) to 15kBT (blue) (where kB is the Boltzmann\u2019s con-stant and T is the absolute temperature). In the calculation of themolecular surface and the electrostatic potential, the vanadatewas omitted and a salt concentration of 0.145M was used. Inframes A and C the native protein model [13] is shown for com-parison with the D292A mutant (frames B and D). To the left ofthe vanadate and to the exterior of the active site a clear differ-ence in the electrostatic potential is visible, resulting partiallyfrom the movement of the 390\u2013396 loopand His404 could become doubly protonated and in-deed form additional hydrogen bonds.The protein seems to form a rigid matrix, allowingthe formation of a very well-defined oxyanion bindingsite as seen previously in the structure of the tungstate-bound CPO [27]. The structure of the recombinantapo-enzyme showed that this active site frame providedby the protein residues remains mainly unchanged. Theresidues Asp292, Lys353, Arg360, Ser402, Gly403,His404 and Arg490 involved in binding of the vanadate(HVO42\u2013) in the native enzyme show only small confor-mational changes necessary to accommodate an anionwith a smaller size and different protonation state(SO42\u2013). The vanadium binding site in the reconstitutedchloroperoxidase (HOLO)The recombinant enzyme reconstituted by addition ofsodium vanadate in a final concentration of 1mM clearly showed the vanadium covalently bound toHis496 (1.94\u00c5) with a trigonal bipyramidal geometrywith three equatorial (bond distances around 1.60\u00c5) and one apical (2.15\u00c5) non-protein oxygen ligands.The distance to the apical ligand is within the range of awater ligand at this position, according to structuralstudies with model compounds [28\u201332]. As observed inFig. 5B, there is still some extra density above this li-gand. The reasons for this extra density are not clear,considering that no chloride was used in the proteinpreparation and crystallisation. The strong affinity ofthis enzyme for vanadate, even with the high concentra-tions of sulfate present, also exclude the possibility thatthis density could represent a mixture between sulfateand the vanadate at the active site. Several trials to fitinto this density different types of ligands such as me-thoxide or ethoxide did not allow us to explain thiselectron density unambiguously.This active site is very similar in conformation andgeometry to the active site of the native protein [13]. Aspreviously observed in the native protein structure, theanion binding site provides a rigid matrix stabilised by anumber of hydrogen bonds (Fig.5A). As observed forthe native protein, the side chains of the amino acid re-sidues interacting directly with the vanadate are held inan ideal conformation by additional hydrogen bondswith residues in the proximity of the active site (Ta-ble 3). A strong salt bridge is also observed between 215 Fig. 4A,B Sulfate interactions at the active site of apo-chlorope-roxidase (APO). The sulfate ion is displayed with oxygens in redand the sulfur atom in yellow. A The hydrogen bonds are repre-sented as grey spheres and the distances are indicated in \u00c5. B Theelectron density map contoured at 4s was calculated after omit-ting His496 and the bound sulfate ion. For comparison the con-formation of the same residues in the native protein [13] is dis-played in blackFig. 5A,B Active site view of HOLO.

B The electron density map contoured at 4s was calculatedafter omitting His496 and the bound vanadatesidues Asp292 and Arg490 which seems to hold Arg490in a perfect conformation for a hydrogen bond to thebound vanadate.H404A Histidine 404 is proposed to play a crucial role as a gen-eral base in catalysis [12]. Steady-state kinetic data indi-cate that protonation of a residue with a pKa higherthan 5 prevents binding of the peroxide during the cata-lytic reaction [14]. This residue was proposed to beHis404. Hydrogen bonding between H404 and the api-cal protonated oxygen of the bound metal cofactor isbelieved to increase the nucleophilicity of the apical hy-droxyl group, allowing it to take up a proton from theincoming peroxide and then leave the vanadium coor-dination sphere as a water molecule.At the active site, removal of the His404 side chaincauses a rupture of the salt bridge between Arg490 andAsp292 (Fig.6). Arg490 moves into the space originallyoccupied by the side chain of His404 and makes hy-drogen bonds to the carbonyl groups of Ala290(3.09 \u00c5) and Trp298 (2.79\u00c5, not shown in Fig.6A). Inthe native protein structure a hydrogen bond is ob-served between His404N\u03b52 and Trp289O. Close to thevanadium binding site, solvent molecules replace partof the hydrogen bonds to the vanadate oxygens whichwere disrupted by the large movement of Arg490 sidechain. The side chain of Asp292 also moves away fromits original position and is only stabilised by a hydrogenbond with one of the new solvent molecules.At the active site the vanadate ion is found covalent-ly bound to His496 (1.96\u00c5). The apical oxygen atom is2.0 \u00c5 away from the vanadium as observed in omitmaps analysed after the final refinements, possibly cor-responding to a mixture between hydroxyl and waterligands at this position [28, 33]. The bond distances be-tween the vanadium and the equatorial oxygen atomsare on average 1.60\u00c5. 216 Table 3 Possible hydrogenbonding interactions involvingresidues in the active site ofrecombinant chloroperoxidase(HOLO) Donor (D)Acceptor (A)Distance D-A (\u00c5)Angle D-H-A (7)Trp350 N\u03b51His222 O3.03 144.8 Lys353 NzPro398 O3.01 139.3 Lys353 NzPro401 O2.58 118.4 Arg360 N\u03b5Phe397 O3.04 158.1 Arg360 Nh1Val495 O2.82 158.1 His404 N\u03b52Trp289 O2.81 128.4 His404 N\u03b52Ala290 O2.80 135.3 Ala405 N Ser402 Og3.13 169.3 His496 Nd1Asp500 Od22.97 153.7 Trp497 N Asp500 Od23.01 161.3 Fig. 6A,B Active site view of mutant H404A.

A The hydrogenbonds are represented as grey spheres and the distances are indi-cated in\u00c5. B The electron density map contoured at 4s was cal-culated after omitting His496 and the bound vanadateAs observed in the native structure, the vanadate isheld by hydrogen bonds to Lys353 (2.79\u00c5), Arg360(3.21 \u00c5) and Ser402 (2.77\u00c5) side chains, and to theamide groups of residues Gly403 (3.09\u00c5) and Ala404(3.07 \u00c5). In addition, two hydrogen bonds are formedbetween Sol1207 (2.61\u00c5), Sol1210 (2.53\u00c5) and theequatorial oxygen OV1. The apical oxygen is hydrogenbonded to Sol1089 (2.68\u00c5) and to Sol1051 (2.81\u00c5). The number of hydrogen bonds formed with the boundanion is not strongly reduced when compared with thenative enzyme. Thus, the vanadate is strongly bound tothe protein as suggested by the relatively low averageB-value for this anion after refinement (21.6\u00c52). Theoverall structure of the active site remains virtually un-changed, as expected from the large number of interac-tions fixing the position of both side chains and themain chain in the anion binding pocket. The movementof the Arg490 side chain seems to be necessary for sta-bilisation of this H404A mutant. This side chain helpsto fix the conformation of the loop containing residuesTrp289 and Ala290. Maintaining the conformation ofthis region is probably very relevant for the folding andstability of V-CPO. The removal of the His404 sidechain nearly completely abolishes the chlorinating ac-tivity of the chloroperoxidase. The activity of this mu-tant is less than 0.1% of the holoenzyme produced re-combinantly (HOLO), suggesting the importance ofthis residue for catalysis. It is unclear, however, wheth-er this loss of activity is a direct result of the removal ofHis404 or from the structural changes in the active sitethat are accompanied by this mutation.D292A The residue Asp292 is located close to the vanadatebinding site and forms a strong salt bridge with Arg490.This salt bridge helps to orient the side chain of Arg490for optimal hydrogen bonding with the bound vanad-ate. When the Asp292 is mutated to an Ala, the confor-mation of the active site remains unchanged (Fig.7). The carboxyl group of the Asp292 is replaced by a sol-vent molecule which hydrogen bonds to the side chainof Arg490. Although the salt bridge is destroyed, theconformation of Arg490 is almost unaltered and seemsto be fixed simply by the interaction with internal sol-vent molecules (Sol1115 and Sol1197). The active sitevanadium is covalently bound to His496 (1.97\u00c5), tothree equatorial oxygen ligands (1.60\u00c5) and to an api-cal oxygen (2.20\u00c5) which could constitute a water li-gand [28\u201332]. The bound vanadate is held by hydrogenbonds to the side chains of Lys353 (2.91\u00c5), Arg360(2.97 and 3.26\u00c5), Ser402 (2.74\u00c5), Arg490 (3.11 217 Fig. 7A,B Active site view of mutant D292A.

The side chain His404 Nd1 is3.06 \u00c5 away from the apical oxygen of the vanadateion. This apical oxygen is hydrogen bonded to Sol1053(3.03 \u00c5). The active site vanadate ion is strongly held in theactive site by a large number of hydrogen bonds. Thisexplains the very low average B-value calculated forthis oxyanion (16.19\u00c52). From the analysis of thisstructure we could expect this D292A mutant to displaysome peroxidase activity. Still, a closer analysis of theelectrostatic potential distribution in the proximity ofthe active site for this mutant reveals that removal ofthe negative charge creates a strongly positive (bluecolour in Fig.3D) electrostatic potential in the proximi-ty of the active site. This is increased by the above-described movement of the region 390\u2013396, whichbrings the side chain of Lys394 to the proximity of theactive site channel. This side chain makes a strong hy-drogen bond to the carbonyl of Ala292. The combina-tion of the mutation and the movement of the Lys394side chain cause an alteration of the electrostatic poten-tial in the vicinity of the active site channel. Activitymeasurements under standard chloroperoxidase assayconditions revealed a large decrease in chlorinating ac-tivity in this mutant (2% of that of the recombinant ho-loenzyme). It remains to be determined whether thislarge reduction in the activity is the result of the changein the electrostatic potential or from a direct role ofAsp292 in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.H496A Upon removal of the His496 side chain a vanadate ionis still found at the active site of the enzyme. Because acovalent bond is no longer formed, the vanadate isfound in a tetrahedral conformation, with three non-protein oxygen ligands at a distance of 1.56\u00c5, and onenon-protein oxygen ligand at a distance of 1.67\u00c5. At the active site of the H496A mutant (Fig.8) thetetrahedral vanadate is found forming hydrogen bondsto the side chains of Lys353 (2.76\u00c5), Arg360 (2.89 and3.06 \u00c5), Ser402 (2.84\u00c5), Arg490 (3.14 and 2.96\u00c5), tothe main chain amide groups of Gly403 (2.95\u00c5) andHis404 (3.18\u00c5) and to solvent molecule Sol219 (2.98and 2.66\u00c5). The apical oxygen of the vanadate ionforms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of His404(3.01 \u00c5) and with Sol1002 (2.54\u00c5). Most of the sidechains at the active site remain in a conformation verysimilar to their conformation in the native enzyme. Theempty space left by removal of the His side chain isfilled up by new solvent molecules which interact withthe vanadate and help fix the conformation of residuesin the active site such as Asp500 (2.72\u00c5). Since thecovalent bond between the vanadate and the protein ismissing, this anion is much more loosely bound to theactive site of the enzyme as seen from the relativelyhigh average B-value it displays (37.50\u00c52). This mu-tant does not exhibit any haloperoxidase activity. Thebinding of the vanadate(V) with the covalent bond be-tween the vanadium and the N\u03b52 of His496 could benecessary for the formation of the monoperoxo-vana-dium(V) complex intermediate as observed in the crys-tal structure of the CPO-peroxo complex [13].R360A The residue Arg360 is involved in the compensation ofthe negative charge of the metal cofactor. In the nativeenzyme the conformation of the side chain of this resi-due seems to be optimised for the interaction with thevanadate. The position of the side chain is stabilised bythe formation of hydrogen bonds with the carbonylgroups of Phe397 and Val495, residues located at themetal binding site.The metal in the R360A mutant is found covalentlybound to His496 (2.01\u00c5), to three equatorial non-pro-tein oxygen atoms (1.58\u20131.62\u00c5) and to an apical 218 Fig. 8A,B Active site view of mutant H496A.

B The electron density map contoured at 4swas calculated after omitting His496 and the vanadatedroxide group (1.77\u00c5 [32]). The hydrogen vanadate isthen held by a number of hydrogen bonds (Fig.9) tothe side chains of Lys353 (2.83\u00c5), Ser402 (2.52\u00c5), His404 (3.18\u00c5) and Arg490 (3.22 and 2.77\u00c5) and tothe main chain nitrogens of Gly403 (2.81\u00c5) and His404(3.17 \u00c5). The apical hydroxyl ligand is forming an addi-tional hydrogen bond to Sol1193 (2.55\u00c5), and one ofthe equatorial oxygens (OV1), which was originally hy-drogen bonded to Arg360 in the native protein, is nowhydrogen bonded to a new solvent molecule (Sol1217,2.53 \u00c5). Curiously, the side chain of Lys394 moves inorder to replace the hydrogen bond Arg360 was mak-ing with Phe397O. This side chain is fixed by an addi-tional hydrogen bond with the new water molecule. Asobserved for mutant H404A, it seems to be necessaryfor the enzyme to fulfill some of the hydrogen bondingpotential of the residues forming the metal binding site.This could be necessary for the enzyme to maintain theintegrity and overall stability around the active site.Activity measurements, under standard conditionsfor chlorination, reveal residual activity for this mutant(6% of that of the recombinant holoenzyme), whichmight be predicted from the structure. Interestingly,preliminary analysis of the kinetic parameters shows in-creased Km values for the substrates, showing that thisresidue affects the activity but is not essential. A de-tailed kinetic analysis of this mutant (together with themutants R490A and K353A) will be reported else-where. Conclusions The active site of V-CPO forms a very rigid matrix de-signed for oxyanion binding. This rigidity results fromthe large number of hydrogen bonding interactions in-volving both the side chains and the main chain of theresidues providing this oxyanion binding frame. Thepresence of a significant number of positively chargedresidues in this frame provides favourable 219 interactions with the negatively charged oxyanions.Thus this site has relative affinities forHVO42\u20131HPO22\u20131SO22\u2013 (data not shown), bindstungstate and we could predict it to bind molybdate, aswas shown for the vanadium bromoperoxidase [34].The differences in affinities for these oxyanions couldresult first from the possibilities they have to form acovalent bond with the active site His496, and addition-ally from the distribution of hydrogen bond donors inthe protein in correlation with the protonation state ofthe oxyanion. Thus, this active site is optimised for thestabilisation of the binding of a tetrahedral oxyanion.We could expect the phosphate to bind in a similar wayto the sulfate but with stronger interactions. Additionalgroups attached to the phosphate in the phosphatasesubstrates could also play a role in determination of ac-tive site affinities.The rigidity of this active site frame is also observedwhen the residues which constitute the active site aremutated to alanines. In general, no large shifts of theremaining side or main chains occur and the emptyspace left by removal of the large side chains is usuallyoccupied by additional solvent molecules. Those sol-vent molecules also replace some of the hydrogenbonding interactions disrupted by the absence of themutated residues, maintaining the conformation of thevanadate and of other side chains. It seems that the sidechains directly interacting with the vanadate are posi-tioned in optimal conformation through a number ofhydrogen bonds with residues forming this metal bind-ing site. As observed from the structure of the CPOmutants, it can be concluded that maintaining the con-formation of the active site is much more complex thancould be expected and does not depend solely on theoptimisation of the interactions with the oxyanion me-tal group. Instead, the large number of hydrogen bondsobserved in the metal binding site seem to act synergis-tically, favouring the interactions with the vanadate andadditionally maintaining the overall stability of this re-gion. Thus, in the mutant H404A we could observe themovement of the Arg490 side chain towards the carbo-nyls of Ala290 and Trp298, at the expense of breaking astrong salt bridge with Asp292 and, most surprisingly,loosening the interactions to the metal cofactor.Acknowledgments We thank Prof. R.

        "NetherlandsAbstract The X-ray structures of the chloroperoxidasefrom Curvularia inaequalis, heterologously expressedin Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been determinedboth in its apo and in its holo forms at 1.66 and 2.11\u00c5 resolution, respectively. The crystal structures revealthat the overall structure of this enzyme remains nearlyunaltered, particularly at the metal binding site. At theactive site of the apo-chloroperoxidase structure aclearly defined sulfate ion was found, partially stabil-ised through electrostatic interactions and hydrogenbonds with positively charged residues involved in theinteractions with the vanadate in the native protein.The vanadate binding pocket seems to form a very rigidframe stabilising oxyanion binding. The rigidity of thisactive site matrix is the result of a large number of hy-drogen bonding interactions involving side chains andthe main chain of residues lining the active site. Thestructures of single site mutants to alanine of the cata-lytic residue His404 and the vanadium protein ligandHis496 have also been analysed. Additionally we deter-mined the structural effects of mutations to alanine ofresidue Arg360, directly involved in the compensationof the negative charge of the vanadate group, and ofresidue Asp292 involved in forming a salt bridge withArg490 which also interacts with the vanadate. The en-zymatic chlorinating activity is drastically reduced toapproximately 1% in mutants D292A, H404A andH496A. The structures of the mutants confirm the viewof the active site of this chloroperoxidase as a rigid ma-trix providing an oxyanion binding site. No largechanges are observed at the active site for any of theanalysed mutants. The empty space left by replacementof large side chains by alanines is usually occupied by anew solvent molecule which partially replaces the hy-drogen bonding interactions to the vanadate. The newsolvent molecules additionally replace part of the inter-actions the mutated side chains were making to otherresidues lining the active site frame. When this is notpossible, another side chain in the proximity of the mu-tated residue moves in order to satisfy the hydrogenbonding potential of the residues located at the activesite",

        "fungi.The chloroperoxidase (CPO) secreted by the fungusCurvularia inaequalis [10] is a vanadium enzyme whichis involved in the production of hypochlorous acid(HOCl). HOCl is a strong bactericidal agent which mayoxidise plant cell walls [11], thus facilitating the pathog-enic role of the fungi. This enzyme is largely thermo-and chemostable, resisting to temperatures up to 707C and to oxidative inactivation in the presence of highconcentrations of peroxide. The crystal structure of na-tive CPO, a 67kDa protein, has been determined to2.03 \u00c5 resolution. It shows 2 four-helix bundles as themain structural motifs [12, 13]. These helical structureshave been proposed to be the major structural elementsof the protein, providing a strong stabilising hydro-phobic effect. The vanadium binding site is located atthe top of the C-terminal second four-helix bundle. Thevanadium coordination geometry is trigonal bipyrami-dal with three oxygen atoms in the equatorial plane(bond lengths about 1.65\u00c5), one apical oxygen atom(bond length 1.93\u00c5) and the other apical nitrogenatom from His496 (bond length 1.96\u00c5). The negativecharge is compensated by hydrogen bonding interac-tions with positively charged or hydrophilic residues lo-cated at the active site. Residues Lys353, Arg360,Ser402, Gly403 and Arg490 form hydrogen bonds withthe equatorial non-protein oxygens of vanadate. Eachof the three equatorial oxygen atoms is hydrogenbonded with at least one positively charged function,which means that these oxygen atoms are deproton-ated. The apical oxygen ligand has a bond length(1.93 \u00c5) which is in the range of a V(V)-hydroxyl bondand it is hydrogen bonded to nitrogen Nd1 of His404.This residue was proposed to function as the acid-basegroup in catalysis [12]. It has been shown [14] that bind-ing of hydrogen peroxide is inhibited when a group ofpKa larger than 5 is protonated. Thus, in the active pro-tein, the apical hydroxyl group is the H-donor and thenitrogen Nd1 of His404 is the H-acceptor of the hydro-gen bond. This residue was proposed to function as theacid-base group in",

Surpris-ingly, those stretches of the sequence were also foundto be present in three families of acid phosphatases, in-dicating similarities in the anion-binding active sites ofall these enzymes [15, 16].

        "elsewhere.Crystallisation and data collectionRecombinant apo-chloroperoxidase (APO) and mutants of CPO(D292A, H496A, H404A and R360A) were produced in a Sac-charomyces cerevisiae expression system as described previously[15]. The recombinant material tends to form crystalline precipi-tates when the crystallisation conditions determined for the nativecrystals are used [13]. Thus, the crystallisation conditions were al-tered in order to allow for slower equilibration rates. The crystalsfrom the recombinant material take 2\u20133 months to grow. Crystalsof D292A, H496A, R360A and recombinant holoenzyme(HOLO) grew at 47C by vapour diffusion. Hanging drops weremade from 3ml of protein solution [5mg/ml in 5mM MOPS (3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid) (pH7.5), 1mM vanadate], 3ml of precipitating buffer containing 1.7M ammonium sulfate, 0.1M Tris-H2SO4 (pH 8.0), 1mM sodium vanadate and 0.3ml 0.1M l-cysteine. Crystals from APO were prepared in a similar way froma precipitating buffer without sodium vanadate. The materialfrom the mutant H404A was largely insoluble when added to thecrystallisation buffer mentioned above. Thus, crystals fromH404A were obtained from 1.3M ammonium sulfate, 0.1M Tris-H2SO4 (pH 8.0)at 207C, after microseeding pre-equilibratedprotein drops with native protein crystals [13]. For the crystallisa-tion of the recombinant material it was always necessary to in-duce crystal nucleation. This was the main reason for the inclu-sion of l-cysteine as an additive, which crystallises as hexagonalplates in the crystallisation conditions used. All crystals belong tospace group R3 and all but the crystals from the mutant H404/Aare isomorphous with the native enzyme crystals.

In the H404Amodel the side chains of residues Arg177 and Glu182are in a different conformation and do not form a saltbridge as observed in the native protein structure(Fig. 1).

In the native protein structure, Pro395 and Phe393are in the immediate vicinity of the bound vanadate ion(see Figs.2, 3A). The side-chain of Lys394 points awayfrom the active site and is fixed by a hydrogen bondwith the main-chain carbonyl of Gly494. In the struc-tures of the mutants D292A and R360A, most of theseresidues are well defined in the electron density map.In the D292A mutant the main chain of residues suchas Phe393 deviates more than 7\u00c5 from its original po-sition in the native structure (Figs.2, 3B) and the sidechain of Lys394 is hydrogen bonded to Ala292O. Thedisplacement of the mentioned residues causes small al-terations in the conformations of the side chains ofGlu196, Phe218 and Gln220. In the APO form of therecombinant protein the well-defined electron densityindicates that this region assumes a conformation simi-lar to the native protein. In the R360A mutant the con-formation of the region containing residues Asp390-Pro396 is well defined and similar to the native CPO.For the mutants H404A, H496A and for the HOLOform of the recombinant native protein this region isnot well defined and it seems that the conformation ofthis protein stretch is alternating between the two mainobserved conformations. The movements of this regiongenerate considerable alterations of the electrostaticpotential distribution in the vicinity of the active sitechannel (Fig.3C, D). The amino acid residues includedin these regions are the same present in the native en-zyme and the nucleotide sequence in this region hasbeen reconfirmed.

Because no vanadatewas added to the recombinant protein before or duringcrystallisation, it was assumed that the species bound tothe metal cofactor binding site could be a tetrahedralsulfate anion, present in high concentrations in thecrystallisation buffer. The presence of a number of po-sitively charged residues, which usually form hydrogenbonds with the vanadate, probably compensate thestrong negative charge of the sulfate ion. This hypothe-sis was further confirmed in the electron density mapscalculated with the higher resolution data obtainedfrom frozen apo-CPO crystals. Thus, a tetrahedral sul-fate was built into the difference electron density andrefined.

Theoverall structure of the active site remains virtually un-changed, as expected from the large number of interac-tions fixing the position of both side chains and themain chain in the anion binding pocket. The movementof the Arg490 side chain seems to be necessary for sta-bilisation of this H404A mutant. This side chain helpsto fix the conformation of the loop containing residuesTrp289 and Ala290. Maintaining the conformation ofthis region is probably very relevant for the folding andstability of V-CPO. The removal of the His404 sidechain nearly completely abolishes the chlorinating ac-tivity of the chloroperoxidase. The activity of this mu-tant is less than 0.1% of the holoenzyme produced re-combinantly (HOLO), suggesting the importance ofthis residue for catalysis. It is unclear, however, wheth-er this loss of activity is a direct result of the removal ofHis404 or from the structural changes in the active sitethat are accompanied by this",

        "The residue Asp292 is located close to the vanadatebinding site and forms a strong salt bridge with Arg490.This salt bridge helps to orient the side chain of Arg490for optimal hydrogen bonding with the bound vanad-ate. When the Asp292 is mutated to an Ala, the confor-mation of the active site remains unchanged (Fig.7). The carboxyl group of the Asp292 is replaced by a sol-vent molecule which hydrogen bonds to the side chainof Arg490. Although the salt bridge is destroyed, theconformation of Arg490 is almost unaltered and seemsto be fixed simply by the interaction with internal sol-vent molecules (Sol1115 and Sol1197). The active sitevanadium is covalently bound to His496 (1.97\u00c5), tothree equatorial oxygen ligands (1.60\u00c5) and to an api-cal oxygen (2.20\u00c5) which could constitute a water li-gand [28\u201332]. The bound vanadate is held by hydrogenbonds to the side chains of Lys353 (2.91\u00c5), Arg360(2.97 and 3.26\u00c5), Ser402 (2.74\u00c5), Arg490 (3.11",

From the analysis of thisstructure we could expect this D292A mutant to displaysome peroxidase activity. Still, a closer analysis of theelectrostatic potential distribution in the proximity ofthe active site for this mutant reveals that removal ofthe negative charge creates a strongly positive (bluecolour in Fig.3D) electrostatic potential in the proximi-ty of the active site. This is increased by the above-described movement of the region 390\u2013396, whichbrings the side chain of Lys394 to the proximity of theactive site channel. This side chain makes a strong hy-drogen bond to the carbonyl of Ala292. The combina-tion of the mutation and the movement of the Lys394side chain cause an alteration of the electrostatic poten-tial in the vicinity of the active site channel. Activitymeasurements under standard chloroperoxidase assayconditions revealed a large decrease in chlorinating ac-tivity in this mutant (2% of that of the recombinant ho-loenzyme). It remains to be determined whether thislarge reduction in the activity is the result of the changein the electrostatic potential or from a direct role ofAsp292 in the catalytic mechanism of the",

Most of the sidechains at the active site remain in a conformation verysimilar to their conformation in the native enzyme. Theempty space left by removal of the His side chain isfilled up by new solvent molecules which interact withthe vanadate and help fix the conformation of residuesin the active site such as Asp500 (2.72\u00c5).

        "Conclusions",
        "The active site of V-CPO forms a very rigid matrix de-signed for oxyanion binding. This rigidity results fromthe large number of hydrogen bonding interactions in-volving both the side chains and the main chain of theresidues providing this oxyanion binding frame. Thepresence of a significant number of positively chargedresidues in this frame provides favourable",

        "interactions with the negatively charged oxyanions.Thus this site has relative affinities forHVO42\u20131HPO22\u20131SO22\u2013 (data not shown), bindstungstate and we could predict it to bind molybdate, aswas shown for the vanadium bromoperoxidase [34].The differences in affinities for these oxyanions couldresult first from the possibilities they have to form acovalent bond with the active site His496, and addition-ally from the distribution of hydrogen bond donors inthe protein in correlation with the protonation state ofthe oxyanion. Thus, this active site is optimised for thestabilisation of the binding of a tetrahedral oxyanion.We could expect the phosphate to bind in a similar wayto the sulfate but with stronger interactions. Additionalgroups attached to the phosphate in the phosphatasesubstrates could also play a role in determination of ac-tive site",
        "affinities.The rigidity of this active site frame is also observedwhen the residues which constitute the active site aremutated to alanines. In general, no large shifts of theremaining side or main chains occur and the emptyspace left by removal of the large side chains is usuallyoccupied by additional solvent molecules. Those sol-vent molecules also replace some of the hydrogenbonding interactions disrupted by the absence of themutated residues, maintaining the conformation of thevanadate and of other side chains. It seems that the sidechains directly interacting with the vanadate are posi-tioned in optimal conformation through a number ofhydrogen bonds with residues forming this metal bind-ing site. As observed from the structure of the CPOmutants, it can be concluded that maintaining the con-formation of the active site is much more complex thancould be expected and does not depend solely on theoptimisation of the interactions with the oxyanion me-tal group. Instead, the large number of hydrogen bondsobserved in the metal binding site seem to act synergis-tically, favouring the interactions with the vanadate andadditionally maintaining the overall stability of this re-gion. Thus, in the mutant H404A we could observe themovement of the Arg490 side chain towards the carbo-nyls of Ala290 and Trp298, at the expense of breaking astrong salt bridge with Asp292 and, most surprisingly,loosening the interactions to the metal",
