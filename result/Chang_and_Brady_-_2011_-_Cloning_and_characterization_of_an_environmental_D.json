Brady*Laboratory of Genetically Encoded Small Molecules, The Rockefeller University, Howard HughesMedical Institute, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065.Abstract Soil is predicted to contain thousands of unique bacterial species per gram. Soil DNA librariesrepresent large reservoirs of biosynthetic diversity from which diverse secondary metabolite geneclusters can be recovered and studied. The screening of an archived soil DNA library usingprimers designed to target oxy-tryptophan dimerization genes allowed us to identify andfunctionally characterize the first indolotryptoline biosynthetic gene cluster. The recovery andheterologous expression of an environmental DNA derived gene cluster encoding the biosynthesisof the antitumor substance BE-54017 is reported here. Transposon mutagenesis identified twomonooxygenases, AbeX1 and AbeX2, as being responsible for the transformation of anindolocarbazole precursor into the indolotryptoline core of BE-54017.A number of structurally diverse and pharmacologically interesting natural products arethought to arise from the dimerization of tryptophan (Figure 1A and 1B).1,2 Biosyntheticgene clusters for violacein3 as well as representative bisindolyquinone (terrequinone A4) andindolocarbazole5-8 (Figure 1B) based metabolites have been cloned and extensivelycharacterized. Most members of this diverse class of metabolites, however, have not beeninvestigated biosynthetically. Soil contains an extraordinarily diverse collection of bothcultured and as yet uncultured bacteria.9,10 DNA isolated from natural populations of soilbacteria (environmental DNA, eDNA) should therefore represent a reservoir from whichadditional tryptophan-dimer biosynthetic gene clusters can be cloned and characterized.Here we report the cloning and heterologous expression of an eDNA derived gene clusterthat encodes the biosynthesis of the antitumor substance BE-54017 (1) (Figure 2).11BE-54017 is part of a small family of indolotryptoline (indolotetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline) basednatural products that show potent activity against tumor cell lines.1,11 Transposonmutagenesis of the abe (antitumor substance BE-54017) gene cluster revealed that theindolotryptoline core of BE-54017 arises from two successive oxidations of anindolocarbazole precursor.To recover tryptophan dimer biosynthetic gene clusters from the environment, we screened apreviously archived soil eDNA cosmid library by PCR using degenerate primers designed torecognize conserved regions in known oxy-tryptophan dimerization genes (StaD/RebD/VioB etc).12,13 Oxy-tryptophan dimerization enzymes were chosen as our probes becausethis enzyme family is used in the biosynthesis of structurally diverse tryptophan dimers.Both indolocarbazole biosynthetic gene clusters (e.g. staurosporine, rebeccamycin, K-252a,*sbrady@rockefeller.edu.

Cosmid clones associated with unique eDNA derived StaD-likehomologs were recovered from the eDNA library using whole-cell PCR on serially dilutedlibrary aliquots. Each recovered cosmid was then de novo sequenced and annotated.One eDNA derived cosmid, AB1650 was found to contain a complete set of conservedindolocarbazole biosynthetic genes (abeO, D, C, P) as well as two monooxygenases (abeX1,X2), three methyltransferases (abeM1, M2, M3) and a halogenase (abeH ) (Figure 3). Thepresence of the two predicted monooxygenases was unprecedented in knownindolocarbazole biosynthetic pathways, suggesting that this gene cluster likely encoded thebiosynthesis of an oxidized or rearranged indolocarbazole based metabolite. To investigatethis possibility, cosmid AB1650 was retrofitted with the genetic elements required forconjugation, selection and stable integration into Streptomyces, and then conjugated intoStreptomyces albus for heterologous expression studies.Cultures of S. albus transformed with AB1650 produce one major clone specific metaboliteas well as four minor clone specific metabolites. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, UV and HR-ESI-MS14 data for the major metabolite (1) are identical to data reported for the antitumorsubstance BE-54017 (Figure 2).11 Minor metabolites 3 and 4 each differ from 1 by the lossof 28 mass units or \u201cCO\u201d.14 Recently reported derivatives of the structurally relatedmetabolite cladoniamide A (2), in which the N-methylsuccinimide has been hydrolyzed,show a similar loss of \u201cCO\u201d.15 As would be expected for correspondingly hydrolyzedBE-54017 derivatives, compounds 3 and 4 both contain a new COSY spin system betweenan amide nitrogen and a methyl singlet that now shows an HMBC correlation to only one ofthe two carbonyl carbons in the structure. HMBC correlations from the C-4c hydroxylproton to C-7a, -5, -4c and -4b in compound 3 and from the C-7a hydroxyl proton to C-7,-7a and -4c in compound 4 allowed us to define the position of the N-methylamide in bothstructures. Based on comparisons of HRMS14 and 2D NMR data, compounds 5 and 6 weredetermined to be the deschloro analogues of compounds 1 and 4, respectively. Compounds 3-6 are novel secondary metabolites (Figure 4).It has been suggested that the indolotryptoline core seen in BE-54017 and the cladoniamidesmight arise either from the oxidation of an indolocarbazole precursor or from anindolocarbazole independent pathway.1,15 To elucidate the origin of the indolotryptolinesubstructure and to assign specific functions to the individual genes found in the abe genecluster, we carried out a transposon mutagenesis study on cosmid AB1650. Individualtransposon mutants were sequenced to identify clones with insertions in key biosyntheticgenes (Figure 5). This collection of transposon mutants was then conjugated back into S.albus and the major clone specific metabolites found in the culture broth extracts of eachmutant were structurally characterized.As would be predicted from what is known about the biosynthesis of indolocarbazoles(Figure 1B), transposon insertions in predicted indolocarbazole biosynthetic genes result ineither the absence of organic extractable clone specific metabolites (abeO, D, R) or in theproduction of the known indolocarbazole intermediate 3-chloro-chromopyrrolic acid (abeC,P) (Figure 5). Homologs of the two predicted oxi-doreductases, abeX1 and abeX2, do notappear in any known bisindole biosynthetic gene clusters. Disruption of abeX2 results in theaccumulation of compound 816 and disruption of abeX1 leads to the accumulation of thesimple indolocarbazole, 3-chloro-arcyriaflavin (7).17 The isolation of compound 7confirmed the indolocarbazole origin of BE-54017.Chang and BradyPage 2J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 January 6.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript Compound 8 contains the C-4c/C-7a diol seen in BE-54017, but has not undergone arearrangement of the indolocarbazole core, while compound 7 contains neither the diol norflipped indole. AbeX1 and AbeX2 show homology to class A flavoprotein monooxygenasesand therefore the oxidation reactions they carry out are predicted to proceed throughepoxides (Figure 6).18 The mutagenesis results coupled with homology arguments allow usto construct a biosynthetic scheme for the formation of the indolotryptoline core inBE-54017 from the indolocarbazole 7 (Figure 6). Our scheme is consistent with theproposed biogenesis of the cladoniamides outlined by Williams, et. al.15 In this scheme thediol is introduced by AbeX1 through the epoxidation of the C-4c/C-7a double bond. AbeX2is then responsible for promoting the rearrangement of the indole via the introduction of asecond epoxide. The opening of this epoxide is accompanied by the fragmentation of theC-7a/C-7b bond, followed by the rotation of the indole around C-12a/C-12b and finally theformation of the C-7a/N-7b bond.Whether the proposed epoxide hydrolysis and indole rearangement reactions occurspontaneously, are catalyzed by the monooxygenases themselves or are catalyzed by otherenzymes is not clear. AbeY shares the same \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold superfamily as most epoxidehydrolases and could therefore play a role in these reactions.19 Our studies suggest howeverthat AbeY is dispensable for the biosynthesis of compounds 1 and 3 -6, as all fivecompounds are produced by the abeY knockout mutant. The appearance of small quantitiesof low-molecular weight clone specific metabolites in extracts from cultures of the abeYmutant suggests that, while AbeY is not required, it may be involved in enhancing theefficiency of one or more biosynthetic transformations, similar to the reported function ofStaC in staurosporine biosynthesis.20 Alternatively, the role of AbeY may be complementedby the host\u2019s endogenous biosynthetic machinery.A detailed accounting of the functionality that appears on the compounds produced in ourtransposon mutagenesis experiments allowed us to assign functions to the threemethyltransferases and the predicted halogenase found in the abe gene cluster (Figure 5).Disruption of abeH, a homolog of the tryptophan halogenase found in the rebeccamycinpathway, led to the accumulation of the deschloro derivative 5, thereby confirming its roleas a halogenase. The absence of the chloride substituent on compound 8 suggested that thetransposon insertion in abeX2 disrupts the expression of downstream genes in the sameoperon. AbeM3 is positioned between abeX2 and abeH and is therefore predicted to betranscriptionally silenced in this transposon mutant. Since both the N-6 and N-13methylations appear on 8, abeM3 is predicted to be responsible for the methylation of theC-12 hydroxyl in BE-54017. The regiospecificity of the two remaining N-methyltransferases, abeM1 and abeM2, was inferred from the accumulation of the O-12/N-6dimethylated derivative 2 (cladoniamide A) in the abeM2 transposon mutant. AbeM1,AbeM2 and AbeM3 are therefore N-6, N-13 and O-12 specific methyltransferases,respectively (Figure 5 inset).No gene in the abe cluster could be linked to the hydrolysis of the N-methylsuccinimidesuggesting that this reaction is either carried out by the host or occurs spontaneously duringthe fermentation process.Compounds 1 -8 were assayed for antiproliferative activity against human colon cancerHCT116 cells. While 3 -8 were not active below 8 \u03bcg/ml, 1 and 2 exhibited potentantiproliferative activities (IC50 \u03bcg/ml: 0.079 for 1 and 0.0088 for 2). Crystallographicstudies have shown that the planar structure of indolocarbazoles is important fortopoisomerase/DNA (rebeccamycin) and kinase (staurosporine) binding.21,22 The C-4c/C-7adiol seen in indolotryptolines causes the N-methylsuccinimide to bend out of the bisindoleplane, which may afford these compounds the ability to bind different cellular targets forChang and BradyPage 3J Am Chem Soc.

Considerable progress has been made in generating novelindolocarbazole analogues by combinatorial biosynthesis, and the identification of AbeX1and AbeX2 provides new tools for producing structurally and functionally diverse bisindolemetabolites.23 The cloning of DNA extracted directly from environmental samples provides a means ofexploring the biosynthetic capacity of thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously.Archived eDNA libraries represent permanent resources from which diverse gene clusterscan be recovered and studied. In this study the screening of an archived eDNA library usingprimers designed to recognize oxy-tryptophan dimerization genes allowed us to clone andcharacterize the first indolotryptoline biosynthetic gene cluster.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Acknowledgments This work was supported by NIH GM077516.

The opening of this epoxide is accompanied by the fragmentation of theC-7a/C-7b bond, followed by the rotation of the indole around C-12a/C-12b and finally theformation of the C-7a/N-7b",
        "bond.Whether the proposed epoxide hydrolysis and indole rearangement reactions occurspontaneously, are catalyzed by the monooxygenases themselves or are catalyzed by otherenzymes is not clear. AbeY shares the same \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold superfamily as most epoxidehydrolases and could therefore play a role in these reactions.19 Our studies suggest howeverthat AbeY is dispensable for the biosynthesis of compounds 1 and 3 -6, as all fivecompounds are produced by the abeY knockout mutant. The appearance of small quantitiesof low-molecular weight clone specific metabolites in extracts from cultures of the abeYmutant suggests that, while AbeY is not required, it may be involved in enhancing theefficiency of one or more biosynthetic transformations, similar to the reported function ofStaC in staurosporine biosynthesis.20 Alternatively, the role of AbeY may be complementedby the host\u2019s endogenous biosynthetic",
        "machinery.A detailed accounting of the functionality that appears on the compounds produced in ourtransposon mutagenesis experiments allowed us to assign functions to the threemethyltransferases and the predicted halogenase found in the abe gene cluster (Figure 5).Disruption of abeH, a homolog of the tryptophan halogenase found in the rebeccamycinpathway, led to the accumulation of the deschloro derivative 5, thereby confirming its roleas a halogenase. The absence of the chloride substituent on compound 8 suggested that thetransposon insertion in abeX2 disrupts the expression of downstream genes in the sameoperon. AbeM3 is positioned between abeX2 and abeH and is therefore predicted to betranscriptionally silenced in this transposon mutant. Since both the N-6 and N-13methylations appear on 8, abeM3 is predicted to be responsible for the methylation of theC-12 hydroxyl in BE-54017. The regiospecificity of the two remaining N-methyltransferases, abeM1 and abeM2, was inferred from the accumulation of the O-12/N-6dimethylated derivative 2 (cladoniamide A) in the abeM2 transposon mutant. AbeM1,AbeM2 and AbeM3 are therefore N-6, N-13 and O-12 specific methyltransferases,respectively (Figure 5",

While 3 -8 were not active below 8 \u03bcg/ml, 1 and 2 exhibited potentantiproliferative activities (IC50 \u03bcg/ml: 0.079 for 1 and 0.0088 for 2). Crystallographicstudies have shown that the planar structure of indolocarbazoles is important fortopoisomerase/DNA (rebeccamycin) and kinase (staurosporine) binding.21,22 The C-4c/C-7adiol seen in indolotryptolines causes the N-methylsuccinimide to bend out of the bisindoleplane, which may afford these compounds the ability to bind different cellular targets",
