Chemical investigations of this strain led to the discovery of an array of novel metabolites in-cluding chloropupukeananin, the first chloropupukeanane de-rivative with a highly functionalized tricyclo-[4.3.1.03,7]-decane skeleton,[8] and related compounds showing significant antimi-crobial, antitumor, and anti-HIV activities.[9] Pestheic acid (1), which is a plant growth regulator first isolated from the patho-genic plant fungus Pestalotiopsis theae,[10] was co-isolated with chloropupukeananes and proposed to be one of the precur-sors of chloropupukeananes.[8] Pestheic acid (1) possesses a diphenyl ether structure. Its analogues, isolated from fungi, include asterric acid, geodin hy-drate,[11] and RES-1214-1.[12] Mutation studies in Aspergillus ter-reus[13] and in vitro synthetic efforts[14] established the biosyn-thetic relationship of a group of phenolic compounds, includ-ing asterric acid, sulochrin, dechlorogeodin, and their corre-sponding chlorinated series: dihydrogeodin, geodin, geodin hydrate, and geodoxin. The diphenyl ether structure of asterric acid was derived from the benzophenone sulochrin, which was converted to the intermediate dechlorogeodin by a phenol ox-idative coupling reaction. The spiran structure of dechlorogeo-din then underwent hydrolysis to form asterric acid. Radio-active tracer studies demonstrated that sulochrin was derived from condensation of acetate and malonate units.[15] Further, anthraquinone emodin and questin were demonstrated to be the precursors of sulochrin and dihydrogeodin in the biosyn-thetic pathway of geodin.[16, 17] Enzymes involved in the biosyn-thesis of geodin, including dihydrogeodin oxidase,[18] emodin O-methyltransferase,[19] emodinanthrone oxygenase,[20] and questin oxygenase[21] have been also identified in A. terreus by Ushio Sankawa\u2019s group. Recently, the biosynthetic gene cluster of monodictyphenone and endocrocin, which are also biosyn-thetic related compounds of emodin, were respectively identi-fied in Aspergillus nidulans[22] and Aspergillus fumigatus.[23] How-ever, no report regarding the complete biosynthetic pathway The diphenyl ether pestheic acid was isolated from the endo-phytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici, which is proposed to be the biosynthetic precursor of the unique chloropupukeananes. The pestheic acid biosynthetic gene (pta) cluster was identified in the fungus through genome scanning. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene cluster encodes a nonreducing poly-ketide synthase, a number of modification enzymes, and three regulators. Gene disruption and intermediate analysis demon-strated that the biosynthesis proceeded through formation of the polyketide backbone, cyclization of a polyketo acid to a benzophenone, chlorination, and formation of the diphenyl ether skeleton through oxidation and hydrolyzation. A dihydro-geodin oxidase gene, ptaE, was essential for diphenyl ether for-mation, and ptaM encoded a flavin-dependent halogenase cat-alyzing chlorination in the biosynthesis. Identification of the pta cluster laid the foundation to decipher the genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in the pathway. [a] X. Xu,+ Dr. L. Liu,+ Dr. F. Zhang, Dr. W. Wang, J. Li, Prof. L.

In the current work, we focus on the biosynthesis of pesthe-ic acid (1). The biosynthetic gene (pta) cluster of 1 was identi-fied in P. fici through genome scanning. The biosynthetic path-way was elucidated through gene disruption, intermediate de-tection, and enzymatic analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of a diphenyl ether. This study also shed light on the genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in the pathway, which is vital to unveil the biosynthetic pathway of chloropupukea-nanes in future work. Results and Discussion Identification of the pestheic acid gene cluster from P. fici The carbon skeleton of 1 (Scheme 1) is identical to that of other fungal diphenyl ethers, including asterric acid and geodin hydrate from A. terreus[13] and RES-1214-1 (2) from Pes-talotiopsis sp. ,[12] and is similar to those of anthraquinones including geodin from A. terreus,[24] emodin from Aspergillus wentii,[25] questin, sulochrin, and dihydrogeodin from Penicilli-um frequentans,[26] and griseofulvin from Penicillium patulum.[27] It has been demonstrated that the backbone of emodin was synthesized by a nonreducing polyketide synthase (PKS), MdpG, containing the typical ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains but lacking the thioesterase/Claisen cyclase (TE/CLC) domain.[22] Considering their close structural and biosynthetic relationship, a similar nonreducing PKS synthase could be involved in the biosynthe-sis of 1. To identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1, the genome of P. fici was sequenced by using the 454 sequencing platform. Analysis of the genomic data (unpublished) revealed a 50 kb contig containing a putative nonreducing PKS gene, ptaA. The deduced protein of PtaA closely resembled the nonreducing PKS GsfA involved in griseofulvin biosynthesis.[28] A closer anal-ysis of the nearby genes showed the presence of a putative gene, ptaM, downstream of ptaA in the contig, which encoded a halogenase that could catalyze the chlorination in the bio-synthesis of 1. Further analysis identified a gene cluster includ-ing ptaA in the contig, which was designated as the pta cluster (Figure 1 A). The annotated genes and the deduced protein functions, along with similarities to their homologues, were listed in Table 1. Transcriptional analysis of the pta cluster was Scheme 1. Diphenyl ethers and their congeners from fungi. The chemical structures of pestheic acid (1) from P. fici,[8] RES-1214-1 (2) from Pestalotiopsis sp. ,[12] performed by RT-PCR for compound 1-producing and -nonpro-ducing conditions. The results showed a clear association be-tween the production of 1 and the expression of the genes (ptaA, ptaE, ptaH, and ptaM) in the cluster (Figure 1 B), suggest-ing that the pta cluster is very likely to be involved in the bio-synthesis of 1 in P. fici. Production of pestheic acid requires a nonreducing PKS coding gene, ptaA To prove the function of the pta cluster in 1 biosynthesis, a transformation system for P. fici was developed based on Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) previously used in other fungal strains.[29] As the strain P. fici was sensitive to hygromycin B in PDA medium, a hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene, hph, was used as the selection marker. Upon replacement by hph, the nonreducing PKS coding gene ptaA was deleted by double crossover homolo-gous recombination. The hygromycin B-resistant transformants were selected and screened by PCR using primers inside and outside the ptaA gene. Three ptaA deletion mutants were fur-ther confirmed by Southern blot analysis to exclude ectopic in-tegrations of the deletion cassette into the genome. All of the mutants showed the expected band size for correct homolo-gous integration of deletion cassette into the corresponding genomic locus of ptaA (Figure 2 A). LC/MS analysis of the ptaA disruption mutants showed that production of 1 was totally abolished (Figure 2 B), indicating that ptaA is essential for the biosynthesis of 1 in P. fici. Additionally, the production of chlor-opupukeananes in the ptaA disruption mutant was totally abolished (Figure S1), whereas the production of iso-A82775C (5), another precursor of chloropupukeananes, was unaffected (Figure 2 B). These results confirmed that pestheic acid is one of the precursors of chloropupukeananin and congeners. As the genes responsible for secondary metabolite biosyn-thesis are generally clustered in fungi,[30] we created deletions of orf2 and orf1\u2019, which are flanked by ptaA and ptaM, to deter-mine the minimal contiguous gene cluster involved in 1 biosyn-thesis (Figure S6 E and F). Metabolite analysis revealed that the deletion mutants of orf2 and orf1\u2019 still pro-duced 1 (Figure 2 B), indicating that they were located outside the pta cluster. In contrast, the knockout ex-periments of ptaA and ptaM con-firmed their essential role in biosyn-Table 1. Putative genes within the pta cluster. thesis of 1 (Figure 2 B; Figure 4 A). These results suggest that the minimal pestheic acid biosynthetic gene cluster contains 16 genes, from ptaA to ptaM. Bioinformatic analysis of the pta gene cluster Identification of the pta cluster is an important step en route to elucidate the enzymatic basis for the biosynthesis of 1. A BLAST search was performed to analyze the putative functions of the genes within and flanking the cluster (Table 1). As dem-onstrated above, the ptaA gene encoding the nonreducing PKS without the TE/CLC domain is responsible for condensa-tion of acetate and malonate to form the carbon skeleton of 1. The deduced product of ptaB showed high similarity to b-lac-tamase-type atrochrysone carboxyl ACP thioesterase (ACTE)[31] and metallo-b-lactamase (VrtG).[28] Similar proteins include EncB from A. fumigatus[23] and AdaB from Aspergillus niger.[32] Both proteins are responsible for hydrolysis and Claisen cyclization of the polyketide endocrocin anthrone[23] and TAN-1612[32] in-stead of the TE/CLC domain of PKS. The ptaC gene encodes a protein with the DUF1772 domain, showing 36 % identities and 56 % positives to the anthrone ox-idase HypC, which catalyzes the oxidation of norsolorinic acid anthrone (NAA) during aflatoxin production in A. flavus.[33] The deduced protein, PtaJ, is a Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidase highly simi-Figure 2. A) Construction and Southern Blot analysis of the ptaA disruption lar to AflY from Aspergillus parasiticus[34] and MdpL from A. ni-dulans.[35] MdpL and AflY were proposed to be involved in the oxidative cleavage of emodin to form the benzophenone skel-eton and the conversion of versicolorin A (VA) to sterigmato-cystin (ST), respectively. Two S-adenosyl-l-methionine-depen-dent methyltransferases are encoded by ptaH and ptaI in this cluster. Methylation of the hydroxy groups has been observed in aflatoxin,[36] elloramycin,[37] hatomarubigin,[38] and others. The ptaE gene encodes a putative dihydrogeodin oxidase (DHGO), which catalyzes the regio-and stereospecific phenol oxidative coupling in the last step of geodin biosynthesis in A. terreus.[39] In addition to ptaE, the deduced protein of ptaK in the cluster also contains a multi-copper oxidase domain, sharing 51 % sim-ilarity to DHGO from A. terreus. DHGO catalyzes phenol oxida-tive coupling in dihydrogeodin more effectively than in sulo-chrin,[39] suggesting that chlorination is important for the phenol oxidative coupling reaction. In agreement, a flavin-de-pendent halogenase coding gene ptaM is located in this clus-ter. The deduced protein PtaF is similar to the NADH-depen-dent oxidoreductase AflX from A. flavus,[40] whereas PtaG is similar to the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase but lacks the conserved domain. AflX is responsible for the conversion of VA to demethylsterigmatocystin (DMST) during aflatoxin biosyn-thesis, but its enzymatic function remains poorly under-stood.[40] Three genes in the pta cluster encode regulators. The de-duced protein of ptaR1 showed high similarity to AflJ, a coacti-vator in aflatoxin biosynthesis,[41] whereas PtaR2 is similar to AflR, a positive regulator controlling transcription of most genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis.[42] The ptaR3 gene encodes a functionally unknown protein having a GAL4-like Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain and a fungal specific transcription factor domain. Three regulatory genes are located in the cluster, sug-gesting that the production of 1 is controlled by a complex regulatory mechanism. DHGO coding gene ptaE is re-sponsible for conversion of chloroisosulochrin to pestheic acid As demonstrated, the stereo-specific phenol oxidative cou-pling catalyzed by DHGO is the most important reaction during the formation of geodin from dihydrogeodin.[39] Three ana-logues of pestheic acid: RES-1214-1 (2), isosulochrin (3), and chloroisosulochrin (4), were coi-solated from the fermentation cultures of P. fici (Figures S2\u2013S5; Tables S1 and S2; Figure 3 A). Considering the structural similarity of 1 to asterric acid, and of 3 to sulochrin and dihydrogeodin, the stereospecific phenol oxidative coupling reaction should be involved in 1 biosynthe-sis. Interestingly, two genes in the pta cluster (ptaE and ptaK) were predicted to encode DHGO-like proteins. To study the functions of ptaE and ptaK and clarify whether PtaE and PtaK are involved in the phenol oxidative coupling in the conver-sion of benzophenones 3 and 4 to diphenyl ethers 2 and 1, the two genes were knocked out by homologous recombina-tion. As expected, the ptaE mutant no longer produced 1 and 2, but accumulated 3 and 4 (Figure 3 B). In contrast, disruption of ptaK did not affect the production of 1 (Figure 3 B). There-fore, PtaE is presumably the key enzyme to catalyze the oxida-tive coupling reactions of benzophenones 3 and 4, regardless of chlorination in P. fici. A flavin-dependent halogenase coding gene ptaM is responsible for chlorination in pestheic acid biosynthesis The halogen group in natural products such as rebeccamycin and vancomycin is important for their biological activities.[43] Enzymatic chlorination is generally catalyzed by haloperoxidas-es or flavin-dependent halogenases.[44] Compounds 1 and 4 were isolated from the fermentation cultures of P. fici, along with their nonchlorinated precursors, 2 and 3. Therefore, we proposed that a flavin-dependent halogenase encoded by ptaM catalyzed the chlorination of 3, which could be the earli-est committed intermediate in the biosynthesis of 1. To verify this proposal, the ptaM gene in P. fici was knocked out by ho-mologous recombination, and the secondary metabolites pro-duced by the wild-type strain and the ptaM knockout mutant Figure 4. PtaM was responsible for cholorination in pestheic acid biosynthesis. A) LC/MS analysis of the metabo-were detected in fermentation cultures by LC/MS (Figure 4 A). Production of 4 and 1 was completely abolished in the mutant, whereas their nonchlorinated precursors, 3 and 2, were accumulated (Figure 4 A), indicating that the ptaM gene is essential for the cholorination step in the biosynthesis of 1. PtaM catalyzes the conversion of isosulochrin to chloroisosulochrin in vitro To confirm the chlorination of 1 by a flavin-dependent halo-genase, the ptaM gene was expressed in E. coli as a recombi-nant protein with an N-terminal His6 tag (63.5 kDa). The chlori-nation catalyzed by a flavin-dependent halogenase requires the reduced FADH2 which could be provided by a partner flavin reductase,[45] but no such gene was found in the pta cluster. Therefore, a flavin reductase coding gene fre was cloned from E. coli and expressed as the N-terminal His-tagged protein (29.5 kDa). The PtaM-His6 and Fre-His6 proteins were purified to near homogeneity on an Ni-NTA column (Figure S7). After adding the coupling Fre-His6 to the reaction mixture, the enzymatic activity of PtaM-His6 to transform 2 and 3 was tested as previously described.[45, 46] LC/MS analysis of the reac-tion mixture demonstrated that PtaM converted 3 to product 3 a (Figure 4 B). The mass spectrum of 3 a showed the [M+H]+ quasimolecular peaks at m/z 367 and 369, with a ratio of 3:1 (Figure 4 B), which is a characteristic isotope pattern of mono-chlorinated compounds. The UV spectra, retention time, and m/z value of 3 a matched the authentic standard of 4, indicat-ing that PtaM could transform 3 to 4 both in vivo and in vitro. However, PtaM failed to convert 2 to the corresponding chlori-nated product (data not shown). These results confirmed that chlorination only occurred at the earliest step in the biosynthe-sis and that PtaM has strict substrate specificity. Kinetic parameters were determined for the conversion of 3 to 4 by PtaM in vitro. Reactions were assayed in the presence of various concentrations of 3. PtaM catalyzed chlorination of 3 with a Km of (155None20) mm, a kcat of (0.089None0.008) minNone1, and a kcat/Km of 0.574 min None1 mmNone1 (Figure 4 C). To further explore the potential halogenation activity of PtaM, we also examined other halogen donors such as bro-mide and iodide. The results showed that PtaM could incorpo-rate bromine into 3 to yield the corresponding monobrominat-ed product, 3 b (Figure 4 B). The mass spectrum showed that 3 b was consistent with an [M+H]+ of 411 and 413 in a 1:1 ratio characteristic of a monobrominated species (Figure 4 B). Chlorinated product 3 a was still observed in the bromination reaction, due to undetermined chloride contamination in the system. No iodinated products were observed in the reaction by PtaM, such as other previously reported flavin-dependent halogenases such as Rdc2[45] and RebH.[46] Proposed biosynthetic pathway for pestheic acid Based on our results from genetic and chemical investigations, as well as the previously reported biosynthetic pathway of asterric acid,[13] geodin,[20] emodin,[22, 47] and endocrocin,[23] the biosynthetic pathway for 1 was proposed (Scheme 2). In our study, disruption of the ptaA gene completely abolished the production of 1 and its congeners, indicating that the biosyn-thesis initiates from condensation of acetate and malonate units catalyzed by the nonreducing PKS PtaA. As the PtaA pro-tein is TE/CLC domain-deficient, hydrolysis and Claisen cycliza-tion of the polyketide could be catalyzed by PtaB containing a b-lactamase domain. This hypothetical function of b-lactamase has been demonstrated by Awakawa et al.[31] The PtaB protein might hydrolyze the thioester bond between the ACP of PtaA and the intermediate to release atrochrysone carboxylic acid, which is spontaneously dehydrated to form endocrocin an-throne. Endocrocin anthrone is then converted to endocrocin, catalyzed by the anthrone oxygenase PtaC. Previous studies have suggested that spontaneous decarboxylation of endocro-cin occurred to generate emodin.[48] However, neither endocro-cin nor emodin was detected in the fermentation cultures of P. fici, probably due to the fact that emodin was readily con-verted to 3 or degraded by some unknown enzymes in P. fici. An O-methyltransferase could methylate emodin to form phys-cion in P. fici as in A. terreus.[49] PtaJ could then catalyze the oxi-dative cleavage of physcion, and rotation of the intermediate could then afford desmethylisosulochrin. Such a rotation of the intermediate was also observed in aflatoxin biosynthesis.[50] PtaF, a putative NADH-dependent oxidoreductase, might also participate in the oxidative cleavage step, as found for AflX.[40] Desmethylisosulochrin will be catalyzed by another O-methyl-transferase to form isosulochrin. Two methylation steps have been found in geodin biosynthesis.[39] In consistence with that, two methyltransferase coding genes ptaH and ptaI are located in the gene cluster of 1. However, whether they play similar roles as in geodin biosynthesis remained unknown. Chlorination of isosulochrin by PtaM could also play an im-portant role in the biosynthesis of 1, considering the signifi-cantly affected activity of DHGO by chlorination of the inter-mediates in geodin biosynthesis.[51] Comparing the structure of geodin to 1, it was found that chlorination of geodin occurred in the aromatic A ring, whereas that of 1 occurred in the cyclo-hexadienone B ring.[51] In agreement with the above results, chlorination of 1 is catalyzed by a flavin-dependent halogenase rather than a chloroperoxidase as for geodin. It has been re-ported that the diphenyl ether was related to spiran generated by phenol oxidative coupling from the benzophenone precur-sor.[11, 13] However, the spiran intermediate was not detected in the fermentation cultures of P. fici in the current work, possibly due to its instability or fast hydrolysis to form a diphenyl ether. Recently, Yu and Snider reported that the spiran spirofuranone was readily converted to dechlorodihydromaldoxin (RES-1214-1 (2)) and dihydromaldoxin (pestheic acid (1)) with 65 % sulfu-ric acid.[52] DHGO catalyzed the stereospecific phenol oxidative cou-pling in dihydrogeodin to form (+)-geodin in A. terreus.[39] The structural similarity of 3 to dihydrogeodin and that of the pro-posed spiran intermediate to geodin suggested involvement of a similar enzyme in the oxidative coupling reaction. Interest-ingly, both PtaE and PtaK have the same multi-copper oxidase domain and share high similarity to DHGO. It is possible for PtaE and PtaK to catalyze the same reaction to convert 3 to None 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the ptaK disruption mutant did not show the same phenotype as the ptaE mutant, which lost the ability to produce 1 and 2 (Figure 3). In the biosynthesis of geodin, dihydrogeodin was used as the substrate of DHGO.[53] Our re-sults indicated that DHGO had substrate flexibility, as PtaE was responsible for both conversions of 3 to 2 and 4 to 1. Disrup-tion of ptaK did not remarkably affect the production of 1, im-plying that PtaE is the key enzyme to catalyze the conversion of 3 to spiran, regardless of chlorination. Geodoxin was isolated from A. terreus[54] and was demon-strated to be derived from diphenyl ether geodin hydrate by oxidative coupling.[13, 14] Maldoxin, which was an analogue of geodoxin, was isolated from the fungus genus Xylaria with three diphenyl ethers : dihydromaldoxin (pestheic acid (1)), iso-dihydromaldoxin, and dechlorodihydromaldoxin (RES-1214-1 (2)).[51] In addition, Suzuki and Kobayashi suggested an alterna-tive biosynthetic hypothesis in which pestheic acid (1) is first oxidized to maldoxin, which was actually involved in the Diels\u2013 Alder reaction to form chloropupukeananin in P. fici.[55] The new proposal was supported by subsequent synthetic efforts of Yu and Snider.[56] Thus, we speculated that maldoxin could also be synthesized through an oxidative coupling reaction of pestheic acid (1) by PtaK in P. fici. Conversely, maldoxin was not detected in the fermentation cultures of P. fici, possibly be-cause it could easily react with iso-A82775C (5) to form chloro-pupukeananes. To demonstrate this hypothesis, in vitro enzy-matic activity assays of PtaK should be carried out in future work. Conclusions In this study, the gene cluster of 1 was cloned and character-ized from P. fici through genome scanning and transcriptional analysis. Results from gene disruption and intermediate analy-sis provided insights into the biosynthesis of 1. To our knowl-edge, this is the first demonstration of the biosynthetic gene cluster for diphenyl ether. The ptaE gene coding a dihydrogeo-din oxidase is essential for converting the benzophenone inter-mediates to diphenyl ethers, whereas ptaM encoding a flavin-dependent halogenase is critical to catalyze the chlorination Scheme 2.

Identification of the pta cluster not only provided the basis for understanding of genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of 1, but also laid the foundation for further exploration of the biosyn-thesis of chloropupukeananin and congeners. Experimental Section Strains, plasmids, and culture conditions: Fungal strains and plas-mids used in this study are listed in Table S3. The fungus P. fici was isolated from the branches of Camellia sinensis in a suburb of Hangzhou, China, in April, 2005. The strain was identified as P. fici based on sequence analysis of the ITS region (GenBank Accession number DQ812914) of the ribosomal DNA and assigned as CGMCC3.15140 in the China General Microbial Culture Collection (CGMCC) center. The strain was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 28 8C for 15 days to produce spores, which were in-oculated in Fernbach flasks (100 mL), each containing rice medium (10 g). Fermentation was carried out at 28 8C for 20 days. Scale-up fermentation was carried out in 12 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing rice medium (80 g) and incubated at 28 8C for 40 days. The PDA medium was also used for pestheic acid (1) pro-duction and the transcriptional analysis of pta genes in P. fici. TSA medium (per liter : tryptone (17 g), soy peptone (3 g), glucose (2.5 g), NaCl (5 g), K2HPO4\u00b73 H2O (2.5 g), and agar (15 g); pH 7.0) supplemented with hygromycin was used to select the transform-ants of P. fici. Liquid medium (0.4 % glucose, 1 % malt extract, and 0.4 % yeast extract; pH 6.5) was used for the growth of P. fici, and the collected mycelia were used for genomic DNA extraction. E. coli TOP10 was routinely used for plasmid propagation. The ro-setta strain of E. coli, purchased from Beijing Transgen Biotech Co. Ltd. , was used for gene expression. Molecular manipulations: The primers used in this study were listed in Table S4. DNA isolation and manipulation in E. coli and P. fici were performed as previously described.[29] PCR amplification was performed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler with KOD FX poly-merase (Toyobo). Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing were per-formed by Life Technologies (Shanghai, China). Sequence analysis: The nucleoside sequence of the pestheic acid gene (pta) cluster has been submitted to the GenBank database under the accession number KC145148. The ORFs were predicted from the sequence by using the GENSCAN Web Server at MIT (http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) and FGENESH (Softberry). The deduced proteins of corresponding genes were compared with other known proteins by on-line BLAST methods (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). The UMA algorithm was used to pre-dict domains in PKS.[57] Construction of the gene disruption mutants of P. fici : To con-struct the gene disruption mutants of P. fici, the DNA fragments of the upstream and downstream regions of target genes were ampli-fied from the genomic DNA by using the primers listed in Table S1. The amplified DNA fragments were respectively recombined to the KpnI site (upstream region) or PacI site (downstream region) of the plasmid pAg1-H3 by using the Fast PCR Clone kit (PUEX), accord-ing to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. As an exception, the down-stream region of ptaA was digested with SwaI/AscI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the plasmid pAg1-H3. The resulting plasmids were introduced into P. fici through Agro-bacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) as previ-ously described.[29] Hygromycin B-resistant colonies were selected after being cultured on PDA at 28 8C for 5 days. The disruption mu-tants were confirmed by PCR using primers inside and outside the corresponding genes. Southern blot analysis was performed with the DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II for fur-ther confirmation of the ptaA disruption mutants. The probe DNA was amplified from genomic DNA of the wild-type strain using the oligonucleotides ptaBRTS and ptaBRTA. RNA isolation and RT-PCR: The mycelia of P. fici cultured on PDA plates for 3 or 6 days were collected. Pestheic acid (1) production was detected after 3 or 6 days of growth of P. fici, and the total RNA was isolated from fungal mycelia using Trizol Reagent (Invitro-gen) according to the commercial manual. RNA was reverse tran-scribed using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Perfect Real Time) fol-lowing the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (TaKaRa). PCR amplification was performed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler using rTaq poly-merase (TaKaRa) with primers ptaARTS/ptaARTA for ptaA, ptaERTS/ ptaERTA for ptaE, ptaHRTS/ptaHRTA for ptaH, ptaMRTS/ptaMRTA for ptaM, and actinF/actinR for the actin gene, respectively. An ini-tial denaturation at 95 8C for 4 min was followed by 30 cycles of amplification (95 8C for 30 s, 56 8C for 30 s, and 72 8C for 1 min) and an additional 8 min at 72 8C. Heterologous expression and purification of PtaM and Fre: The mycelia of P. fici cultured in rice medium for 15 days were harvest-ed, and the total RNA was isolated. First-strand cDNA reverse tran-scribed from the total RNA was used as the template. A 1620 bp DNA fragment containing the entire cDNA of ptaM was amplified with the primers ptaMF and ptaMR. A 699 bp DNA fragment con-taining the open reading frame of the fre gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of E. coli BL21 with the primers freF and freR. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the vector pEASY-Blunt (Transgen, Beijing, China) and sequenced to verify their accu-racy. They were then digested by NdeI and EcoRI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pET28a vector to generate the plas-mids pET28a::ptaM and pET28a::fre, respectively. To express the corresponding proteins, the recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli Rosetta strains. The Rosetta strain con-taining plasmid pET28a::ptaM or pET28a::fre was grown overnight at 37 8C in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin. The above overnight culture (2 mL, 1 %, v/v) was inoculated into LB medium (200 mL) and incubated at 37 8C on a rotary shaker to an OD600 of 0.6. The culture was induced by IPTG (0.1 mm) and incubated at 28 8C for an additional 4 h. The harvested cells were washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris\u00b7HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 5 % glycerol ; pH 7.9). After being resuspended in the same buffer (20 mL), the cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was centri-fuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 8C, and the soluble fraction was purified with a Ni-NTA spin column (Novagen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s manual. The concentration of the purified pro-teins was determined using the BAC protein assay reagent (Nova-gen). In vitro enzymatic activity of PtaM: The halogenation activity of PtaM was measured as previously described.[45, 46] The typical reac-tion mixture (100 mL) contained substrate (0.05 mg), FAD (100 mm), NADH (10 mm), NaCl (10 mm, NaBr for bromination), Fre (16 mm), and PtaM (32 mm) in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.0). The compo-nents were mixed and incubated at 28 8C for 30 min. The reaction mixture, including all components except for PtaM, was carried out concomitantly as the control. The reaction mixtures were extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and analyzed by LC/MS. To measure the kinetic parameters for the chlorination of isosulochrin by PtaM, a series of reaction systems were set up in the presence of FAD None 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "Introduction",
        "Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that reside in the internal tissues of living plants or animals without causing apparent disease.[1] They have been demonstrated to be a rich source of bioactive metabolites with diverse structural features.[2] Over the past decades, endophytic fungi have attracted increasing attention, due to the pharmaceutical and ecological signifi-cance of their secondary metabolites.[3] The widely prescribed anticancer drug paclitaxel (taxol), one of the most notable nat-ural products initially isolated from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia,[4] was later found in the endophytic fungus Taxomy-ces andreanae[5] and several species of the genus Pestalotiop-sis.[6] A loline alkaloid produced by the endophytic fungus Epi-chloe festucae could increase the resistance of grasses to insect herbivores and environmental stresses.[7]",
        "The endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici CGMCC3.15140 was isolated from the branches of Camellia sinensis (Theaceae) in a suburb of Hangzhou, China. Chemical investigations of this strain led to the discovery of an array of novel metabolites in-cluding chloropupukeananin, the first chloropupukeanane de-rivative with a highly functionalized tricyclo-[4.3.1.03,7]-decane skeleton,[8] and related compounds showing significant antimi-crobial, antitumor, and anti-HIV activities.[9] Pestheic acid (1), which is a plant growth regulator first isolated from the patho-genic plant fungus Pestalotiopsis theae,[10] was co-isolated with chloropupukeananes and proposed to be one of the precur-sors of chloropupukeananes.[8]",
        "Pestheic acid (1) possesses a diphenyl ether structure. Its analogues, isolated from fungi, include asterric acid, geodin hy-drate,[11] and RES-1214-1.[12] Mutation studies in Aspergillus ter-reus[13] and in vitro synthetic efforts[14] established the biosyn-thetic relationship of a group of phenolic compounds, includ-ing asterric acid, sulochrin, dechlorogeodin, and their corre-sponding chlorinated series: dihydrogeodin, geodin, geodin hydrate, and geodoxin. The diphenyl ether structure of asterric acid was derived from the benzophenone sulochrin, which was converted to the intermediate dechlorogeodin by a phenol ox-idative coupling reaction. The spiran structure of dechlorogeo-din then underwent hydrolysis to form asterric acid. Radio-active tracer studies demonstrated that sulochrin was derived from condensation of acetate and malonate units.[15] Further, anthraquinone emodin and questin were demonstrated to be the precursors of sulochrin and dihydrogeodin in the biosyn-thetic pathway of geodin.[16, 17] Enzymes involved in the biosyn-thesis of geodin, including dihydrogeodin oxidase,[18] emodin O-methyltransferase,[19] emodinanthrone oxygenase,[20] and questin oxygenase[21] have been also identified in A. terreus by Ushio Sankawa\u2019s group. Recently, the biosynthetic gene cluster of monodictyphenone and endocrocin, which are also biosyn-thetic related compounds of emodin, were respectively identi-fied in Aspergillus nidulans[22] and Aspergillus fumigatus.[23] How-ever, no report regarding the complete biosynthetic pathway",
        "The diphenyl ether pestheic acid was isolated from the endo-phytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici, which is proposed to be the biosynthetic precursor of the unique chloropupukeananes. The pestheic acid biosynthetic gene (pta) cluster was identified in the fungus through genome scanning. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene cluster encodes a nonreducing poly-ketide synthase, a number of modification enzymes, and three regulators. Gene disruption and intermediate analysis demon-strated that the biosynthesis proceeded through formation of the polyketide backbone, cyclization of a polyketo acid to a benzophenone, chlorination, and formation of the diphenyl ether skeleton through oxidation and hydrolyzation. A dihydro-geodin oxidase gene, ptaE, was essential for diphenyl ether for-mation, and ptaM encoded a flavin-dependent halogenase cat-alyzing chlorination in the biosynthesis. Identification of the pta cluster laid the foundation to decipher the genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in the pathway.",

        "In the current work, we focus on the biosynthesis of pesthe-ic acid (1). The biosynthetic gene (pta) cluster of 1 was identi-fied in P. fici through genome scanning. The biosynthetic path-way was elucidated through gene disruption, intermediate de-tection, and enzymatic analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of a diphenyl ether. This study also shed light on the genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in the pathway, which is vital to unveil the biosynthetic pathway of chloropupukea-nanes in future work.",
        "Results and Discussion Identification of the pestheic acid gene cluster from P. fici The carbon skeleton of 1 (Scheme 1) is identical to that of other fungal diphenyl ethers, including asterric acid and geodin hydrate from A. terreus[13] and RES-1214-1 (2) from Pes-talotiopsis sp. ,[12] and is similar to those of anthraquinones including geodin from A. terreus,[24] emodin from Aspergillus wentii,[25] questin, sulochrin, and dihydrogeodin from Penicilli-um frequentans,[26] and griseofulvin from Penicillium patulum.[27] It has been demonstrated that the backbone of emodin was synthesized by a nonreducing polyketide synthase (PKS), MdpG, containing the typical ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains but lacking the thioesterase/Claisen cyclase (TE/CLC) domain.[22] Considering their close structural and biosynthetic relationship, a similar nonreducing PKS synthase could be involved in the biosynthe-sis of 1.",
        "To identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1, the genome of P. fici was sequenced by using the 454 sequencing platform. Analysis of the genomic data (unpublished) revealed a 50 kb contig containing a putative nonreducing PKS gene, ptaA. The deduced protein of PtaA closely resembled the nonreducing PKS GsfA involved in griseofulvin biosynthesis.[28] A closer anal-ysis of the nearby genes showed the presence of a putative gene, ptaM, downstream of ptaA in the contig, which encoded a halogenase that could catalyze the chlorination in the bio-synthesis of 1. Further analysis identified a gene cluster includ-ing ptaA in the contig, which was designated as the pta cluster (Figure 1 A). The annotated genes and the deduced protein functions, along with similarities to their homologues, were listed in Table 1. Transcriptional analysis of the pta cluster was",

        "performed by RT-PCR for compound 1-producing and -nonpro-ducing conditions. The results showed a clear association be-tween the production of 1 and the expression of the genes (ptaA, ptaE, ptaH, and ptaM) in the cluster (Figure 1 B), suggest-ing that the pta cluster is very likely to be involved in the bio-synthesis of 1 in P. fici.",
        "Production of pestheic acid requires a nonreducing PKS coding gene, ptaA To prove the function of the pta cluster in 1 biosynthesis, a transformation system for P. fici was developed based on Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) previously used in other fungal strains.[29] As the strain P. fici was sensitive to hygromycin B in PDA medium, a hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene, hph, was used as the selection marker. Upon replacement by hph, the nonreducing PKS coding gene ptaA was deleted by double crossover homolo-gous recombination. The hygromycin B-resistant transformants were selected and screened by PCR using primers inside and outside the ptaA gene. Three ptaA deletion mutants were fur-ther confirmed by Southern blot analysis to exclude ectopic in-tegrations of the deletion cassette into the genome. All of the mutants showed the expected band size for correct homolo-gous integration of deletion cassette into the corresponding genomic locus of ptaA (Figure 2 A). LC/MS analysis of the ptaA disruption mutants showed that production of 1 was totally abolished (Figure 2 B), indicating that ptaA is essential for the biosynthesis of 1 in P. fici. Additionally, the production of chlor-opupukeananes in the ptaA disruption mutant was totally abolished (Figure S1), whereas the production of iso-A82775C (5), another precursor of chloropupukeananes, was unaffected (Figure 2 B). These results confirmed that pestheic acid is one of the precursors of chloropupukeananin and congeners.",

Metabolite analysis revealed that the deletion mutants of orf2 and orf1\u2019 still pro-duced 1 (Figure 2 B), indicating that they were located outside the pta cluster.

        "Identification of the pta cluster is an important step en route to elucidate the enzymatic basis for the biosynthesis of 1. A BLAST search was performed to analyze the putative functions of the genes within and flanking the cluster (Table 1). As dem-onstrated above, the ptaA gene encoding the nonreducing PKS without the TE/CLC domain is responsible for condensa-tion of acetate and malonate to form the carbon skeleton of 1. The deduced product of ptaB showed high similarity to b-lac-tamase-type atrochrysone carboxyl ACP thioesterase (ACTE)[31] and metallo-b-lactamase (VrtG).[28] Similar proteins include EncB from A. fumigatus[23] and AdaB from Aspergillus niger.[32] Both proteins are responsible for hydrolysis and Claisen cyclization of the polyketide endocrocin anthrone[23] and TAN-1612[32] in-stead of the TE/CLC domain of PKS.",
        "The ptaC gene encodes a protein with the DUF1772 domain, showing 36 % identities and 56 % positives to the anthrone ox-idase HypC, which catalyzes the oxidation of norsolorinic acid anthrone (NAA) during aflatoxin production in A. flavus.[33] The deduced protein, PtaJ, is a Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidase highly simi-",

        "lar to AflY from Aspergillus parasiticus[34] and MdpL from A. ni-dulans.[35] MdpL and AflY were proposed to be involved in the oxidative cleavage of emodin to form the benzophenone skel-eton and the conversion of versicolorin A (VA) to sterigmato-cystin (ST), respectively. Two S-adenosyl-l-methionine-depen-dent methyltransferases are encoded by ptaH and ptaI in this cluster. Methylation of the hydroxy groups has been observed in aflatoxin,[36] elloramycin,[37] hatomarubigin,[38] and others. The ptaE gene encodes a putative dihydrogeodin oxidase (DHGO), which catalyzes the regio-and stereospecific phenol oxidative coupling in the last step of geodin biosynthesis in A. terreus.[39] In addition to ptaE, the deduced protein of ptaK in the cluster also contains a multi-copper oxidase domain, sharing 51 % sim-ilarity to DHGO from A. terreus. DHGO catalyzes phenol oxida-tive coupling in dihydrogeodin more effectively than in sulo-chrin,[39] suggesting that chlorination is important for the phenol oxidative coupling reaction. In agreement, a flavin-de-pendent halogenase coding gene ptaM is located in this clus-ter. The deduced protein PtaF is similar to the NADH-depen-dent oxidoreductase AflX from A. flavus,[40] whereas PtaG is similar to the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase but lacks the conserved domain. AflX is responsible for the conversion of VA to demethylsterigmatocystin (DMST) during aflatoxin biosyn-thesis, but its enzymatic function remains poorly under-stood.[40]",
        "Three genes in the pta cluster encode regulators. The de-duced protein of ptaR1 showed high similarity to AflJ, a coacti-vator in aflatoxin biosynthesis,[41] whereas PtaR2 is similar to AflR, a positive regulator controlling transcription of most genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis.[42] The ptaR3 gene encodes a functionally unknown protein having a GAL4-like Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain and a fungal specific transcription factor domain. Three regulatory genes are located in the cluster, sug-gesting that the production of 1 is controlled by a complex regulatory mechanism.",
        "DHGO coding gene ptaE is re-sponsible for conversion of chloroisosulochrin to pestheic acid As demonstrated, the stereo-specific phenol oxidative cou-pling catalyzed by DHGO is the most important reaction during the formation of geodin from dihydrogeodin.[39] Three ana-logues of pestheic acid: RES-1214-1 (2), isosulochrin (3), and chloroisosulochrin (4), were coi-solated from the fermentation cultures of P. fici (Figures S2\u2013S5; Tables S1 and S2; Figure 3 A). Considering the structural similarity of 1 to asterric acid, and of 3 to sulochrin and dihydrogeodin, the stereospecific phenol oxidative coupling reaction should be involved in 1 biosynthe-sis. Interestingly, two genes in the pta cluster (ptaE and ptaK) were predicted to encode DHGO-like proteins. To study the functions of ptaE and ptaK and clarify whether PtaE and PtaK are involved in the phenol oxidative coupling in the conver-sion of benzophenones 3 and 4 to diphenyl ethers 2 and 1, the two genes were knocked out by homologous recombina-tion. As expected, the ptaE mutant no longer produced 1 and 2, but accumulated 3 and 4 (Figure 3 B). In contrast, disruption of ptaK did not affect the production of 1 (Figure 3 B). There-fore, PtaE is presumably the key enzyme to catalyze the oxida-tive coupling reactions of benzophenones 3 and 4, regardless of chlorination in P. fici.",
        "A flavin-dependent halogenase coding gene ptaM is responsible for chlorination in pestheic acid biosynthesis The halogen group in natural products such as rebeccamycin and vancomycin is important for their biological activities.[43] Enzymatic chlorination is generally catalyzed by haloperoxidas-es or flavin-dependent halogenases.[44] Compounds 1 and 4 were isolated from the fermentation cultures of P. fici, along with their nonchlorinated precursors, 2 and 3. Therefore, we proposed that a flavin-dependent halogenase encoded by ptaM catalyzed the chlorination of 3, which could be the earli-est committed intermediate in the biosynthesis of 1. To verify this proposal, the ptaM gene in P. fici was knocked out by ho-mologous recombination, and the secondary metabolites pro-duced by the wild-type strain and the ptaM knockout mutant",

Production of 4 and 1 was completely abolished in the mutant, whereas their nonchlorinated precursors, 3 and 2, were accumulated (Figure 4 A), indicating that the ptaM gene is essential for the cholorination step in the biosynthesis of 1.",
        "PtaM catalyzes the conversion of isosulochrin to chloroisosulochrin in vitro To confirm the chlorination of 1 by a flavin-dependent halo-genase, the ptaM gene was expressed in E. coli as a recombi-nant protein with an N-terminal His6 tag (63.5 kDa). The chlori-nation catalyzed by a flavin-dependent halogenase requires the reduced FADH2 which could be provided by a partner flavin reductase,[45] but no such gene was found in the pta cluster. Therefore, a flavin reductase coding gene fre was cloned from E. coli and expressed as the N-terminal His-tagged protein (29.5 kDa). The PtaM-His6 and Fre-His6 proteins were purified to near homogeneity on an Ni-NTA column (Figure S7). After adding the coupling Fre-His6 to the reaction mixture, the enzymatic activity of PtaM-His6 to transform 2 and 3 was tested as previously described.[45, 46] LC/MS analysis of the reac-tion mixture demonstrated that PtaM converted 3 to product 3 a (Figure 4 B). The mass spectrum of 3 a showed the [M+H]+ quasimolecular peaks at m/z 367 and 369, with a ratio of 3:1 (Figure 4 B), which is a characteristic isotope pattern of mono-chlorinated compounds. The UV spectra, retention time, and m/z value of 3 a matched the authentic standard of 4, indicat-ing that PtaM could transform 3 to 4 both in vivo and in vitro. However, PtaM failed to convert 2 to the corresponding chlori-nated product (data not shown). These results confirmed that chlorination only occurred at the earliest step in the biosynthe-sis and that PtaM has strict substrate specificity.",
        "Kinetic parameters were determined for the conversion of 3 to 4 by PtaM in vitro. Reactions were assayed in the presence of various concentrations of 3. PtaM catalyzed chlorination of 3 with a Km of (155None20) mm, a kcat of (0.089None0.008) minNone1, and a kcat/Km of 0.574 min None1 mmNone1 (Figure 4 C).",
        "To further explore the potential halogenation activity of PtaM, we also examined other halogen donors such as bro-mide and iodide. The results showed that PtaM could incorpo-rate bromine into 3 to yield the corresponding monobrominat-ed product, 3 b (Figure 4 B). The mass spectrum showed that 3 b was consistent with an [M+H]+ of 411 and 413 in a 1:1 ratio characteristic of a monobrominated species (Figure 4 B). Chlorinated product 3 a was still observed in the bromination reaction, due to undetermined chloride contamination in the system. No iodinated products were observed in the reaction by PtaM, such as other previously reported flavin-dependent halogenases such as Rdc2[45] and RebH.[46]",
        "Proposed biosynthetic pathway for pestheic acid Based on our results from genetic and chemical investigations, as well as the previously reported biosynthetic pathway of asterric acid,[13] geodin,[20] emodin,[22, 47] and endocrocin,[23] the biosynthetic pathway for 1 was proposed (Scheme 2). In our study, disruption of the ptaA gene completely abolished the production of 1 and its congeners, indicating that the biosyn-thesis initiates from condensation of acetate and malonate units catalyzed by the nonreducing PKS PtaA. As the PtaA pro-tein is TE/CLC domain-deficient, hydrolysis and Claisen cycliza-tion of the polyketide could be catalyzed by PtaB containing a b-lactamase domain. This hypothetical function of b-lactamase has been demonstrated by Awakawa et al.[31] The PtaB protein might hydrolyze the thioester bond between the ACP of PtaA and the intermediate to release atrochrysone carboxylic acid, which is spontaneously dehydrated to form endocrocin an-throne. Endocrocin anthrone is then converted to endocrocin, catalyzed by the anthrone oxygenase PtaC. Previous studies have suggested that spontaneous decarboxylation of endocro-cin occurred to generate emodin.[48] However, neither endocro-cin nor emodin was detected in the fermentation cultures of P. fici, probably due to the fact that emodin was readily con-verted to 3 or degraded by some unknown enzymes in P. fici. An O-methyltransferase could methylate emodin to form phys-cion in P. fici as in A. terreus.[49] PtaJ could then catalyze the oxi-dative cleavage of physcion, and rotation of the intermediate could then afford desmethylisosulochrin. Such a rotation of the intermediate was also observed in aflatoxin biosynthesis.[50] PtaF, a putative NADH-dependent oxidoreductase, might also participate in the oxidative cleavage step, as found for AflX.[40] Desmethylisosulochrin will be catalyzed by another O-methyl-transferase to form isosulochrin. Two methylation steps have been found in geodin biosynthesis.[39] In consistence with that, two methyltransferase coding genes ptaH and ptaI are located in the gene cluster of 1. However, whether they play similar roles as in geodin biosynthesis remained unknown.",
        "Chlorination of isosulochrin by PtaM could also play an im-portant role in the biosynthesis of 1, considering the signifi-cantly affected activity of DHGO by chlorination of the inter-mediates in geodin biosynthesis.[51] Comparing the structure of geodin to 1, it was found that chlorination of geodin occurred in the aromatic A ring, whereas that of 1 occurred in the cyclo-hexadienone B ring.[51] In agreement with the above results, chlorination of 1 is catalyzed by a flavin-dependent halogenase rather than a chloroperoxidase as for geodin. It has been re-ported that the diphenyl ether was related to spiran generated by phenol oxidative coupling from the benzophenone precur-sor.[11, 13] However, the spiran intermediate was not detected in the fermentation cultures of P. fici in the current work, possibly due to its instability or fast hydrolysis to form a diphenyl ether. Recently, Yu and Snider reported that the spiran spirofuranone was readily converted to dechlorodihydromaldoxin (RES-1214-1 (2)) and dihydromaldoxin (pestheic acid (1)) with 65 % sulfu-ric acid.[52]",
        "DHGO catalyzed the stereospecific phenol oxidative cou-pling in dihydrogeodin to form (+)-geodin in A. terreus.[39] The structural similarity of 3 to dihydrogeodin and that of the pro-posed spiran intermediate to geodin suggested involvement of a similar enzyme in the oxidative coupling reaction. Interest-ingly, both PtaE and PtaK have the same multi-copper oxidase domain and share high similarity to DHGO. It is possible for PtaE and PtaK to catalyze the same reaction to convert 3 to",

        "Geodoxin was isolated from A. terreus[54] and was demon-strated to be derived from diphenyl ether geodin hydrate by oxidative coupling.[13, 14] Maldoxin, which was an analogue of geodoxin, was isolated from the fungus genus Xylaria with three diphenyl ethers : dihydromaldoxin (pestheic acid (1)), iso-dihydromaldoxin, and dechlorodihydromaldoxin (RES-1214-1 (2)).[51] In addition, Suzuki and Kobayashi suggested an alterna-tive biosynthetic hypothesis in which pestheic acid (1) is first oxidized to maldoxin, which was actually involved in the Diels\u2013 Alder reaction to form chloropupukeananin in P. fici.[55] The new proposal was supported by subsequent synthetic efforts of Yu and Snider.[56] Thus, we speculated that maldoxin could also be synthesized through an oxidative coupling reaction of pestheic acid (1) by PtaK in P. fici. Conversely, maldoxin was not detected in the fermentation cultures of P. fici, possibly be-cause it could easily react with iso-A82775C (5) to form chloro-pupukeananes.

        "Experimental Section Strains, plasmids, and culture conditions: Fungal strains and plas-mids used in this study are listed in Table S3. The fungus P. fici was isolated from the branches of Camellia sinensis in a suburb of Hangzhou, China, in April, 2005. The strain was identified as P. fici based on sequence analysis of the ITS region (GenBank Accession number DQ812914) of the ribosomal DNA and assigned as CGMCC3.15140 in the China General Microbial Culture Collection (CGMCC) center. The strain was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 28 8C for 15 days to produce spores, which were in-oculated in Fernbach flasks (100 mL), each containing rice medium (10 g). Fermentation was carried out at 28 8C for 20 days. Scale-up fermentation was carried out in 12 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing rice medium (80 g) and incubated at 28 8C for 40 days. The PDA medium was also used for pestheic acid (1) pro-duction and the transcriptional analysis of pta genes in P. fici. TSA medium (per liter : tryptone (17 g), soy peptone (3 g), glucose (2.5 g), NaCl (5 g), K2HPO4\u00b73 H2O (2.5 g), and agar (15 g); pH 7.0) supplemented with hygromycin was used to select the transform-ants of P. fici. Liquid medium (0.4 % glucose, 1 % malt extract, and 0.4 % yeast extract; pH 6.5) was used for the growth of P. fici, and the collected mycelia were used for genomic DNA extraction. E. coli TOP10 was routinely used for plasmid propagation. The ro-setta strain of E. coli, purchased from Beijing Transgen Biotech Co. Ltd. , was used for gene expression. Molecular manipulations: The primers used in this study were listed in Table S4. DNA isolation and manipulation in E. coli and P. fici were performed as previously described.[29] PCR amplification was performed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler with KOD FX poly-merase (Toyobo). Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing were per-formed by Life Technologies (Shanghai, China). Sequence analysis: The nucleoside sequence of the pestheic acid gene (pta) cluster has been submitted to the GenBank database under the accession number KC145148. The ORFs were predicted from the sequence by using the GENSCAN Web Server at MIT (http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) and FGENESH (Softberry). The deduced proteins of corresponding genes were compared with other known proteins by on-line BLAST methods (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). The UMA algorithm was used to pre-dict domains in PKS.[57] Construction of the gene disruption mutants of P. fici : To con-struct the gene disruption mutants of P. fici, the DNA fragments of the upstream and downstream regions of target genes were ampli-fied from the genomic DNA by using the primers listed in Table S1. The amplified DNA fragments were respectively recombined to the KpnI site (upstream region) or PacI site (downstream region) of the plasmid pAg1-H3 by using the Fast PCR Clone kit (PUEX), accord-ing to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. As an exception, the down-stream region of ptaA was digested with SwaI/AscI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the plasmid pAg1-H3. The resulting plasmids were introduced into P. fici through Agro-bacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) as previ-ously described.[29] Hygromycin B-resistant colonies were selected after being cultured on PDA at 28 8C for 5 days. The disruption mu-tants were confirmed by PCR using primers inside and outside the corresponding genes. Southern blot analysis was performed with the DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II for fur-ther confirmation of the ptaA disruption mutants. The probe DNA was amplified from genomic DNA of the wild-type strain using the oligonucleotides ptaBRTS and ptaBRTA. RNA isolation and RT-PCR: The mycelia of P. fici cultured on PDA plates for 3 or 6 days were collected. Pestheic acid (1) production was detected after 3 or 6 days of growth of P. fici, and the total RNA was isolated from fungal mycelia using Trizol Reagent (Invitro-gen) according to the commercial manual. RNA was reverse tran-scribed using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Perfect Real Time) fol-lowing the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (TaKaRa). PCR amplification was performed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler using rTaq poly-merase (TaKaRa) with primers ptaARTS/ptaARTA for ptaA, ptaERTS/ ptaERTA for ptaE, ptaHRTS/ptaHRTA for ptaH, ptaMRTS/ptaMRTA for ptaM, and actinF/actinR for the actin gene, respectively. An ini-tial denaturation at 95 8C for 4 min was followed by 30 cycles of amplification (95 8C for 30 s, 56 8C for 30 s, and 72 8C for 1 min) and an additional 8 min at 72 8C. Heterologous expression and purification of PtaM and Fre: The mycelia of P. fici cultured in rice medium for 15 days were harvest-ed, and the total RNA was isolated. First-strand cDNA reverse tran-scribed from the total RNA was used as the template. A 1620 bp DNA fragment containing the entire cDNA of ptaM was amplified with the primers ptaMF and ptaMR. A 699 bp DNA fragment con-taining the open reading frame of the fre gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of E. coli BL21 with the primers freF and freR. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the vector pEASY-Blunt (Transgen, Beijing, China) and sequenced to verify their accu-racy. They were then digested by NdeI and EcoRI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pET28a vector to generate the plas-mids pET28a::ptaM and pET28a::fre, respectively. To express the corresponding proteins, the recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli Rosetta strains. The Rosetta strain con-taining plasmid pET28a::ptaM or pET28a::fre was grown overnight at 37 8C in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin. The above overnight culture (2 mL, 1 %, v/v) was inoculated into LB medium (200 mL) and incubated at 37 8C on a rotary shaker to an OD600 of 0.6. The culture was induced by IPTG (0.1 mm) and incubated at 28 8C for an additional 4 h. The harvested cells were washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris\u00b7HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 5 % glycerol ; pH 7.9). After being resuspended in the same buffer (20 mL), the cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was centri-fuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 8C, and the soluble fraction was purified with a Ni-NTA spin column (Novagen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s manual. The concentration of the purified pro-teins was determined using the BAC protein assay reagent (Nova-gen). In vitro enzymatic activity of PtaM: The halogenation activity of PtaM was measured as previously described.[45, 46] The typical reac-tion mixture (100 mL) contained substrate (0.05 mg), FAD (100 mm), NADH (10 mm), NaCl (10 mm, NaBr for bromination), Fre (16 mm), and PtaM (32 mm) in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.0). The compo-nents were mixed and incubated at 28 8C for 30 min. The reaction mixture, including all components except for PtaM, was carried out concomitantly as the control. The reaction mixtures were extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and analyzed by LC/MS. To measure the kinetic parameters for the chlorination of isosulochrin by PtaM, a series of reaction systems were set up in the presence of FAD",
