Genomic analysis of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100 identified three novel putative members of this enzyme class. They were shown to introduce halogen substituents into, e. g., substituted indoles, while preferring bromide over chloride. Keywords: halogenases; bromination; regioselectivity; Xanthomonas Introduction Regioselective activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds is a valuable but also challenging approach to build up larger molecule structures and to incorporate functional groups in organic scaffolds for further derivatization. The regioselective incorporation of halogen substitu-ents in aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds con-veniently allows a plethora of follow-up transforma-tions like metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions or nucleophilic substitutions. Halogenation by chemical synthesis requires molecular halogen and in the case of aromatic substrates, corrosive Lewis acid catalysts. Regioselectivity often is the key challenge and not always easy to achieve.[1,2] Nature has evolved several strategies to generate halogenated natural products with interesting biolog-ical activities.[3] In many cases, both the type and the position of the halogen substituent in such metabolites exert a great influence on the biological activity.[4] Halogenated secondary metabolites with antibacterial, antifungal, or antitumor activity have been isolated from different organisms like bacteria, fungi, algae or plants,[5\u20138] which sparked investigations on their bio-synthesis, in particular on the key step, the enzymatic halogenation.[9] As chloride is the most abundant halide in the geosphere, chlorinated natural products prevail over other halogenated compounds. Enzymatic halogenation follows different chemical strategies and the halogen-ases can thus be classified according to their mecha-nisms of action. Fluorinases utilize fluoride for halogenation by nucleophilic substitution, but are limited to a few substrates.[10] \u03b1-Ketoglutarate-depend-ent halogenases introduce halide substituents (chloride, bromide) regioselectively even at non-activated ali-phatic positions via a radical mechanism and usually require a substrate bound to a carrier protein.[11\u201313] Haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases generate hypohalous acid from halide salts for aro-matic electrophilic substitution (SEAr). While haloper-oxidases use hydrogen peroxide for that purpose,[14] flavin-dependent halogenases convert molecular oxy-gen into a flavin hydroperoxide intermediate.[9] Recently, enzymes have been getting more and more involved in chemical conversions due to their remarkable specificity and selectivity. The selective halogenation of non-activated CH bonds that only FULL PAPER DOI: 10.1002/adsc.201801591 Adv. Synth. Catal. 2019, 361, 2475\u20132486 \u00a9 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim2475 relies on halide salts and oxygen under ambient conditions certainly is a \u2018dream reaction\u2019 of organic chemistry. However, not all available halogenases meet the requirements with respect to specificity and selectivity: Haloperoxidases release freely diffusible hypohalous acid and, hence, lack selectivity.[9,15] Dairi et al. identified in 1995 the gene encoding an enzyme responsible for the chlorination of tetracycline that did not display any resemblance to halo-peroxidases.[16] Few years later, a second member of this novel enzyme class was identified in Pseudomonas fluorescens BL915 and was named PrnA. It is a flavin-dependent halogenase that is involved in the biosyn-thesis of pyrrolnitrin.[17] Flavin-dependent halogenases like PrnA catalyze halogenation of aromatic substrates with high specifi-city and regioselectivity, often regardless the presence of a directing group within the substrate.[18] Some of these enzymes are involved in polyketide synthesis or non-ribosomal peptide synthesis and require a carrier-bound substrate, while others accept soluble substrates.[19\u201321] Subsequent to the discovery of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA, several other flavin-dependent halogenases have been characterized; e. g. KtzQ and KtzR from actinobacteria Kutzneria Sp. that are involved in the dichlorination at C6 and C7 position of tryptophan during the biosynthesis of the antifungal natural product kutzneride.[22] PyrH from Streptomyces rugosporus halogenates tryptophan at position 5 in pyrroindomycin biosynthesis.[23] RebH from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes catalyzes regiose-lective halogenation of tryptophan at position 7 in the rebeccamycin biosynthesis.[24] Thal, another flavin-dependent halogenase involved in the biosynthesis of thienodolin in Streptomyces albogriseolus, was found to regioselectively chlorinate and brominate tryptophan at position 6.[25] In all flavin-dependent halogenases conserved se-quence signatures and structural features were distin-guished. They are believed to play an important role in the identification and mechanism of action of this enzyme group. For instance, the presence of the motif GxGxxG within the flavin binding domain that is also conserved in all flavin-dependent enzymes plays an important role in binding of the flavin cofactor to the enzyme. Another motif, WxWxIP, located at the flavin binding domain, is believed to block binding of the substrate near the flavin cofactor, and hence to prevent halogenases from functioning as monooxygenases.[21,26] The groups of van P\u00e9e and Walsh pioneered the discovery and characterization of flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases and largely contributed to the elucidation of the enzyme mechanism.[27,28] The reac-tion proceeds through the oxidation of the reduced flavin cofactor (FADH2) with molecular oxygen gen-erating a C4\u03b1-hydroperoxyflavin (FAD-OOH). This reactive intermediate is attacked by the halide nucleo-phile to form hypohalous acid (HOX). The crystal structure[29,30] reveals that HOX has to diffuse through a 10 \u00c5 long tunnel that separates the flavin binding site from the active site pocket. The proposal of HOX reacting with a conserved active site lysine residue generating an N-haloamine as halogenating agent is still under debate.[27] The Wheland complex formed upon attack of the halonium electrophile on the aromatic substrate is subsequently deprotonated by a conserved glutamate residue generating the halogen-ated product (Scheme 1).[30\u201334] In general, flavin-dependent halogenases exhibit low to moderate activity.[35] A recent theoretical study attempting to identify the possible mechanism of the halogenation reaction revealed that one of the rate limiting steps is the deprotonation of the Wheland intermediate by a glutamate residue.[36] The flavin binding domain on the other hand also influences the rate of hypohalous acid generation and its transfer to the active site and, hence, the overall rate of halogen-ation reaction. The regioselectivity of the enzymatic halogenation is mainly based on steric and entropic factors. The amino acid residues located at the active site entrance Scheme 1. Schematic view of the catalytic mechanism of and pocket control substrate access and orientation. Hence, the position of halogenation mainly is inde-pendent from the presence of directing groups within the aromatic ring.[26,33] Because of these key advan-tages, FAD-dependent halogenases recently attracted more and more attention as valuable biocatalysts for chemical transformations. Investigations on novel halogenases or engineering the existing ones, for broader substrate scope, enhanced activity, and stabil-ity have been conducted.[18,37\u201341] Xanthomonas comprises a group of Gram negative Proteobacteria infecting over 350 monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species.[42] The plant patho-gen Xanthomonas campestris (Xcc) is a member of this group infecting crucifers like cabbage and cauliflower. It causes black rot disease by invading the vascular tissue of the host plant.[42] They produce a character-istic yellow pigment called xanthomonadin, a mixture of brominated aryl polyene esters considered as a chemotaxonomic feature for Xanthomonas sp.[43] In addition, they secret the exopolysaccharide xanthan, commercially known as xanthan gum. It is employed, e. g., as thickening agent and emulsifier in food and pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, xanthomonads are considered an important group of bacteria for their commercial, biotechnological application and their economic importance as plant pathogen.[44,45] Besides, they might be a source for novel halogenases, considering the brominated xanthomonadin, with new substrate spectrum. Results and Discussion In the frame of our studies directed towards the discovery of novel halogenases, we investigated three novel putative flavin-dependent tryptophan halogen-ases, identified and cloned from the genome of the xanthan producing Xanthomonas campestris pv. cam-pestris B100 strain.[46] Identification of Xcc Halogenases The whole genome of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strain B100[46] (Accession no.: PRJNA436896) was screened for the signature motifs GxGxxG and WxWxIP present in the FAD binding domain and that are consensus and characteristic for the whole flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases. Three genes were identified and annotated as trypto-phan halogenases, namely xcc-b100_1333, xcc-b100_ 4156, and xcc-b100_4345. However, further structural and functional characterization was necessary to confirm their class and activity. Expression of Xcc Halogenases In order to verify the results of the gene annotation, the three putative halogenases were produced recombi-nantly in E. coli as previously reported for other cases with co-expression of the chaperons groES and groEL. Under these conditions, all halogenases were obtained in soluble form.[47,48] SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins indicated a molecular mass of ~60 kDa for Xcc4156, while Xcc1333 and Xcc4345 have lower molecular masses of ~55 kDa matching the calculated values of 58 kDa for Xcc4156 and 56 kDa for both Xcc1333 and 4345 (Figure S1). The Xcc halogenases were further analyzed biochemically using the monochlorodimedon assay[29] to exclude haloperox-idase activity. In this assay, the activity of the halogenase can be monitored photometrically due to the halogenation of an artificial substrate, monochlor-odimedon, which readily reacts in solution with HOX to give its geminal dihalogenated derivative.[49] In a reaction mixture containing monochlorodimedon, the flavin cofactor, flavin reductase PrnF and alcohol dehydrogenase (enzymatic regeneration system) were excluded (Scheme 1). No halogenation of monochloro-dimedon could be detected in presence and absence of the Xcc halogenases. Although their natural substrates are still unknown, the Xcc halogenases share a high pairwise identity to tryptophan halogenases like RebH, PrnA and PyrH (Figure S2). Therefore, tryptophan and indole deriva-tives were selected for a preliminary substrate screen-ing. In addition, different halide salts (NaCl, NaBr, NaI) were investigated for the halogenation of the accepted substrates. Initial screening revealed that bromination of indole and some indole derivatives was possible, but not chlorination. Tryptophan surprisingly was not accepted by all three halogenases, despite their annotation as tryptophan halogenases. Hence, indole was used as a substrate for further optimization. A buffer screening showed that 50 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 7.4 led to the highest halogenase activity (Fig-ure S3). The storage stability of the purified enzymes at 4 \u00b0C was also investigated using indole as substrate. Activity was retained for more than three weeks, leading to 100% conversion of 1 mm indole using 21 mol% (12.4 mgmLNone 1) of Xcc halogenases. Substrate Screening Based on the initial results, a larger array of com-pounds was selected for a more elaborate substrate screening (Scheme S1). Enzymatic conversion was monitored by RP-HPLC, RP-HPLC-MS, and GC-MS to identify halogenated products. Besides using chloride as halide source, a particular interest was placed on bromide. Notably, the Xcc halogenases FULL PAPER asc.wiley-vch.de Adv. Synth. Catal. 2019, 361, 2475\u20132486 \u00a9 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim2477 investigated were found to exclusively brominate the substrates indole, 7-azaindole, 5-hydroxytryptophan, tryptophol and other heterocyclic derivatives, even in the presence of an excess of chloride (Table 1). Although the three enzymes share little identity on the sequence level (49\u201350%), they showed nearly similar substrate scope. Regioselectivity of Enzymatic Halogenation The reactions were scaled up and performed on a semi-preparative scale to determine the regioselectivity of the enzymatic halogenation. Each Xcc halogenase was precipitated with ammonium sulfate together with the auxiliary enzymes PrnF and ADH and immobilized with glutaraldehyde to yield cross linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA).[50,51] This approach was success-fully applied in previous studies for the upscaling of enzymatic halogenation using the tryptophan 7-halo-geanse RebH.[52] The optimal glutaraldehyde concentration for the different halogenases was determined, as excessive cross-linking may lead to loss of enzymatic activity. 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde was found to yield the highest conversion among the other tested glutaraldehyde percentages (Figure S4). Furthermore, the resulting CLEAs could be re-used in three batches while retaining halogenase activity (Figure S4).[53] Several substrates could be halogenated using halogenase-CLEAs in sufficient amounts for structural elucidation by NMR spectroscopy, whereas other substrates were hardly converted (Table 1). Among all substrates tested so far, indole led to the highest conversions. MS analysis confirmed product forma-tion, also showing the typical isotope pattern com-monly observed for monobrominated compounds (Scheme 2). This is also true for the rest of the brominated substrates. NMR analysis revealed C3 as bromination site, which is the electronically most favoured position for electrophilic substitution in the indole ring.[47] Notably, previous studies on the sub-strate scope of the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH also showed chlorination of indole at the C3 position of the pyrrole ring.[54] In the halogenase, FADH2 efficiently reacts with molecular oxygen to form a flavin-hydroperoxide. This reactive intermediate leads to hypohalous acid forma-tion which subsequently halogenates the substrate. However, hydrolysis of the flavin-hydroperoxide re-sults in the release of H2O2. This uncoupling side reaction is commonly observed in flavin-dependent enzymes like monooxygenases and halogenases (\u201coxy-gen dilemma\u201d).[55\u201357] It leads to a loss of reducing equivalents required for product formation, while forming H2O2 as a strong oxidant. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to affect e. g. the stability of dehydrogenases by oxidation of cysteine and methionine residues.[58\u201360] The oxygen dilemma can be levied by addition of superoxide dismutase or catalase to the reaction. Therefore, it was important to add catalase to the preparative scale halogenation reactions for H2O2 elimination. Indole bromination by the Xcc halogenases was found to proceed efficiently only after portionwise (e.g. daily) addition of catalase (Figure 1) to decom-pose hydrogen peroxide.[61] Without daily addition of catalase, the reaction was observed to stop, most likely due to halogenase and dehydrogenase inhibition. Attempts to co-immobilize catalase together with Xcc halogenase, flavin reductase and alcohol dehydrogen-ase revealed the instability of the immobilized catalase over time. After 4\u20135 days, the reaction rate declines Table 1. Total turnover number and regioselectivity of the three flavin-dependent halogenases with the brominated substrates. and stops completely if no additional catalase is added to the reaction. This observation provides additional evidence that the Xcc halogenases do not belong to the class of haloperoxidases that utilize H2O2 to generate hypohalous acid in solution for non-regioselective halogenation. A control experiment using immobilized flavin reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase with the daily addition of catalase, but omitting the halogenase, confirmed that bromination is halogenase dependent. The regioselectivity of the novel enzymes was investigated by selecting a panel of substrates based on different substituent patterns and electronic character-istics. While indole is being accepted by all enzymes leading to the formation of 3-bromoindole, C3-sub-stituted indoles (tryptophol, 3-formylindole, 3-(3-in-dolyl)propionic acid, (3-indolyl)acetonitrile) were con-verted only sluggishly. As the conversion of these 3-substituted substrates is low, only some products could be isolated in sufficient yields for structure elucidation. These compounds were shown to be brominated at the electronically unfavoured C7 position (Scheme 3, Fig-ure S5).[48,54] Despite the higher reactivity of the C2 position of the pyrrole ring, the regioselectivity of the enzyme plays a role in directing the halogenation to the less reactive C7 position instead. Indole derivatives with substituents at the benzene ring like 5-hydroxy-indole are only accepted by Xcc4156. 5-methylindole is accepted by each of Xcc4345 and 1333 with low to moderate activity, whereas 5-cyanoindole is sluggishly brominated by all three halogenases. Noteworthy, 7-azaindole and also 3-formylindole could be halogen-ated to a small extent with Xcc4156 (Table 1), however providing insufficient amounts for NMR analysis. 5-Hydroxytryptophan, whose C3 position is substituted with the amino acid backbone, was brominated in the C6 position. This is in agreement with the ortho-directing effect exerted by the hydroxyl functionality (Figure S6).[48] Docking and molecular dynamics simulation stud-ies with tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan on the Xcc4156 confirmed that both substrates can access the Scheme 2. (A) Scheme for the enzymatic bromination of indole active site. In contrast to 5-hydroxytryptophan, trypto-phan binding was not stabilized by hydrogen bonding or other interactions within the active site throughout the simulation time (1 ns, data not shown). This explains the inability of the Xcc halogenases to brominate tryptophan. The hydroxyl group of 5-hydroxytryptophan is involved in the formation of a hydrogen bond with Glu337. This is also true for other tryptophan halogenases (RebH and PyrH) where tryptophan is stabilized by hydrogen bonding, main-taining its correct positioning within the active site for the halogenation to occur.[30] On the other hand, dibromination products of 5-methylindole and 5-hydroxyindole could also be explained in the same sense. The stability of these substrates within the active site is more enhanced by their small size, facilitating the accessibility to the active site pocket. In addition, the presence of substituents like a hydroxyl group enables the inter-action (by H-bonding formation) with amino acid residues within the active site. At the same time, these substituents also increase the electron density of the substrate to promote SEAr. Nevertheless, a crystal structure of the novel halogenases soaked with these substrates would help understanding the selectivity issues. Halogenation via SEAr usually follows mesomeric and/or inductive effects of the substituents that influence the electron density in the aromatic ring and hence the site of halogenation. When the most nucleophilic C3 position of the indole ring is occupied, bromination takes place in the six-membered ring and in case of 5-hydroxytryptophan the hydroxyl group directs bromination to the C6 position due to its positive mesomeric effect. Similarly, phenol is bromi-nated in the electronically favored para position. However, if the C3 position of indole is unsubstituted, bromination takes place there, regardless of the substituents present on the benzene ring. This was observed with indole-5-carbaldehyde brominated with Xcc1333, as well as 5-cyanoindole brominated with both Xcc1333 and 4345. By blocking the electronically favored position 3 in the pyrrole ring for the electro-philic aromatic substitution and the absence of direct-ing substituents on the benzene ring halogenation takes place at the C7 position. This was observed with all three halogenases in the case of tryptophol and 3-(3-indolyl)propionic acid with Xcc4345 and 1333 (Ta-ble 1). Total Turnover Number (TTN) The total turnover number of the novel halogenases was determined to obtain information on the efficiency of the enzymes towards different substrates (Table 1). All enzymes display a relatively moderate to low TTN towards the tested substrates with values between 0 and 60. Remarkably, 5-hydroxytryptophan is converted by Xcc4345 with a TTN of 12, whereas tryptophan is not accepted by any investigated halogenase. In general, the TTN is higher for indole, 5-methylindole and 5-hydroxyindole, which indicates that indole, indole derivatives or smaller heterocyclic compounds accommodate better within the active site. Bulky Scheme 3. (A) Semi-preparative bromination of tryptophol substituents are less tolerated according to the observed TTN (Figure S7). Thermostability of Xcc Halogenases Temperature is an important factor affecting the enzymatic activity and increased thermal stability of enzymes may be associated with improved turnover. Xcc4156 was found to be temperature sensitive and even at 30 \u00b0C the activity was largely reduced. Xcc1333 showed higher stability; with 23, 35, and 18% conversion of indole as substrate at 25, 30, and 37 \u00b0C after 7 hours of reaction time, respectively. Xcc4345 showed lower activity at 30 \u00b0C and the activity was dramatically reduced at 37 \u00b0C (Figure 2, S8). All Xcc halogenases were not active at 45 \u00b0C and precipitated. The stability profile of the three halogen-ases aligns with the observed TTN, where Xcc1333 showed the highest TTN against most of the tested substrates (Table 1). The protein stability was also investigated using circular dichroism spectroscopy and melting temper-atures (Tm) of 46 \u00b0C and 47 \u00b0C were determined for Xcc4345 and Xcc4156, respectively, while Xcc1333 has a slightly higher Tm of 54 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the observed conversions at elevated temperature. Homology Model and Structural Analysis of Xcc Halogenases A homology model was established to provide information on the 3D structure and to enable align-ment studies with other related enzyme structures. Blast analysis of Xcc4156, 1333 and 4345 sequences revealed the most related structures to the target sequence. The highest identity sequences for Xcc4156 were RebH with 33.6% and PrnA with 32.3% identity. Xcc1333 showed 33.1% identity to PyrH and 31% to RebH. Xcc4345 showed 36.0%, 35.8% and 32.9% identity to PyrH, PrnA, and RebH, respectively. Though the sequence identity was relatively low, it was confirmed that the Xcc enzymes have an FAD binding site and the active site residues conserved for flavin-dependent halogenases. Hybrid homology models of Xcc4156 and 1333 were based on combined parts from 25 models built by YASARA Structure. Analysis of the built model was performed after aligning with apo-RebH, PyrH and PrnA, soaked with the substrate tryptophan and the flavin cofactor. It was assumed that the structures of Xcc4156 and Xcc1333 combine features of both RebH and PrnA.[30] One prominent difference compared to RebH concerns the loop (residues 40\u201348) covering bound FAD. In case of RebH, this loop is oriented away from the FAD, leaving it exposed to the surrounding environment. However, in case of Xcc1333 the loop (residues 41\u201319) covers FAD in a similar fashion as in PrnA. This is also true for Xcc4156 with slight structural deviation at the allox-azine moiety of FAD binding site. As a result of insertion and deletion, the \u03b1-helix covering the active site entrance in tryptophan halogenases is shorter in the Xcc halogenases, where a loop exists leaving the active site pocket exposed. Xcc1333 however, has a longer loop compared to Xcc4156, which might rigid-ify upon substrate binding covering the active site (Figure 3). Obviously, the presence of such loops within the enzyme structure and in particular at the active site entrance may influence substrate specificity and kinetic characteristics of the enzyme. This was observed for RebH (PDB entry: 2OA1), where the \u03b1-helix covering the active site directly interacts with the substrate tryptophan forming hydrogen bonds with residues Tyr454, Glu461, Tyr455 and Phe465. The absence of such interactions in Xcc halogenases explains their inability to catalyze tryptophan halogenation. Besides that, bulky residues are found within the active site of Xcc4156 and Xcc1333 that differ from tryptophan halogenases RebH. For instance, Ser434 in Xcc1333 is substituted by the polar residue Asn, while Phe430 in Xcc1333 is substituted by Trp and Val379 by Thr. In addition to the structural and residual differences within the active site, similar residues in both enzymes are found in different orientation towards or away from the active site cavity. Those changes would affect the interaction, orientation and stabilization of the substrates and hence affect substrate specificity and regioselectivity (Table S1). Figure 2. Time course of indole halogenation by the three Xcc Further sequence analysis for Xcc4156 was per-formed in comparison with the sequences of other tryptophan halogenases; PyrH (GenBank: AAU95674.1), PrnA (GeneBank: AAB97504), Thal (GeneBank: ABK79936.1) and RebH (GeneBank: Q8KHZ8) (Figure S2). Notably, the signature motifs for FAD-dependent halogenases GxGxxG and WxWxIP, both highly conserved in all tryptophan halogenases, are present in the three Xcc halogenases as well.[26,29] In addition, the conserved residues that are believed to be directly involved in the halogenation within the active site, a distinct Lys and Glu residue, are also present in the three Xcc halogenases.[33] The homology models built for Xcc4156 and Xcc1333 provided detailed insight into the active site pocket geometry. The three novel enzymes have 40\u2013 50% pairwise sequence identity within the active site and its surrounding. Nevertheless, a profound insight within the active site pocket and the residues that might be involved in the substrate binding, have revealed very high identity (>90%) with similar residues explaining the similar substrate specificity and regioselectivity of Xcc halogenases (Table S1). Conclusion Three putative flavin-dependent halogenase genes from different locations of the Xanthomonas campest-ris genome show high similarity to flavin-dependent halogenase genes with respect to the flavin binding site and active site residues. Despite having been annotated as tryptophan halogenases, the enzymes do not accept tryptophan as a substrate. The lack of the required interactions to stabilize tryptophan within the active site pocket might give an explanation. On the contrary, 5-hydroxytryptophan is being brominated as a result of a hydrogen bond formed between its hydroxyl group and Glu337. Indole and substituted indoles are being accepted. However, for bulkier substrates lower TTN was detected. Biochemical characterization revealed the ability of the halogenases to exclusively brominate their substrates, even in the presence of excess chloride salt. A difference in the amino acid residues surround-ing the halide binding site could explain the bromide preference. However, the 10 \u00c5 tunnel connecting the FAD binding domain and the active site pocket could have an influence on the accessibility of the hypoha-lous acid for a selective transport towards the active site. Further structural characterization via site directed mutagenesis might help revealing the reason for bromide selectivity and also alter the substrate selectivity and enzymatic activity. Despite the low reaction rates exhibited by halogenases, they still accomplish regioselective halogenation reactions diffi-cult to be effected by other conventional chemical approaches. The structural and biochemical investiga-tion of the novel halogenases have expanded our knowledge on the flavin-dependent halogenases and will assist exploiting the enzymatic halogenation reactions. Experimental Section Sequence Analysis The protein sequence of the target halogenases were blasted using UniProt blast with proteins of known 3D structure as target database and E-threshold of 10. The result was further used for sequence alignment using EMBL-EBI Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment tool for generating the Neighbour Joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis and for determining the sequence identity percentage. Figure 3. Superimposed homology model of Xcc1333 (blue) Homology Models The homology model for Xcc4156 was built using SWISS-MODEL server automated mode which relies on ProMod3 as modelling engine. More refined models of Xcc4156 and Xcc1333 were built with Yasara Structure using the default settings.[62] Further comparative analysis was conducted based on the alignment results of Clustal Omega. Heterologous Gene Expression For the heterologous expression of the Xcc-B100 halogenase genes Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagene) was trans-formed with the pET28a+ plasmid encoding the corresponding Xcc-B100 halogenase gene, as well as the pGro7 plasmid (Takara) for chaperone co-expression. 60 \u03bcgmLNone 1 Kanamycin and 50 \u03bcgmLNone 1 chloramphenicol were added to 1 L Luria-Bertani (LB) media, which was then inoculated with 20 mL of the preculture and incubated at 37 \u00b0C until it reached an OD600nm of 0.6. Protein production was induced using 100 \u03bcm isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 2 mgmLNone 1 l-arabinose. The temperature was lowered to 25 \u00b0C for the rest of the cultivation. The cells were harvested after 20 h by centrifugation (4000\u00d7g, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C) and stored at None 20 \u00b0C. For the production of the flavin reductase PrnF, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain BL915 \u0394ORF1-4 containing the expression vector pCIBhis-prnF was grown overnight at 30 \u00b0C in LB medium containing 30 \u03bcgmLNone 1 tetracycline. At 30 \u00b0C 1L of LB medium with the appropriate antibiotics was inoculated with 10 mL of the over-night culture and cultivated for 3 d. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at None 20 \u00b0C. Production of the alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus ruber was conducted in E.coli BL21(DE3) previously transformed with pGro7 (Takara) and pET21-ADH. The preculture supplemented with 50 \u03bcgmLNone 1 chloramphenicol and 100 \u03bcgmLNone 1 ampicillin was grown over-night at 30 \u00b0C in LB medium. 20 mL of the preculture were used to inoculate 1 L LB medium containing the same antibiotics. The culture was grown at 30 \u00b0C until an OD600nm of 0.3 was reached. At that point, the incubation temperature was lowered to 25 \u00b0C, 0.5 mm ZnCl2 and 2 mgmLNone 1 l-arabinose were added. Induction of ADH expression was done using 0.1 mm IPTG at OD600nm of 0.6. The cells were harvested after 16 h by centrifugation and kept at None 20 \u00b0C. Enzyme Purification For purification of His6-tagged Xcc halogenase and flavin-reductase PrnF, 1.5 L of E. coli culture was resuspended by vortexing in 30 mL 100 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) and lysed three times by French Press (1000 psig). The total lysate was centrifuged (10000\u00d7g, 45 min, 4 \u00b0C) and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm Whatman filter. The soluble fraction was injected (flowrate 0.5 mLminNone 1) on a pre-equilibrated HisTALON agarose affinity column with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl or NaBr (equilibration buffer). The column was washed with 15 mL equilibration buffer (flow 1 mLminNone 1) followed by 20 mL 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl or NaBr (washing buffer, flow 1 mLminNone 1). The protein was eluted in 0.5 mL aliquots with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl or NaBr (elution buffer, flow 0.5 mLminNone 1). 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used for the analysis of different fractions during the course of protein purification. Alcohol dehydrogenase ADH was purified via heat precipitation by heating the lysate from 1.5 L of culture to 60 \u00b0C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation to remove denatured proteins. The supernatant was stored at None 20 \u00b0C. Chemical Analysis and Product Purification Reactions were monitored by using RP-HPLC on a Thermo Scientific Accela 600 equipped with a Thermo Scientific Hypersil GOLD 3 mm column (C18, 150\u00d72.1 mm, solvent A H2O/CH3CN/TFA=95:5:0.1, solvent B H2O/CH3CN/TFA= 5:95:0.1, with a flow of 0.7 mLminNone 1 using a gradient from 0\u2013 100% B over 5 min). LC/MS analysis was accomplished by using a AllianceHT 2795 HPLC system equipped with C8 Symmetry column (length: 100 mm, diameter: 2.1 mm, particle size: 3.5 \u03bcm), coupled with a Waters micromass ZQ2000 ESI-MS (gradient in 10 min from 5% B to 95% B, back to 5% B in 0.2 min, total run time 25 min at a flow of 400 \u03bcL minNone 1, solvent A H2O:HCOOH 100:0.1, solvent B of CH3CN:HCOOH 100:0.1). GC-MS analysis was done using TRACE GC coupled to a Polaris Q mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with VF-5 MS column (30 m\u00d70.25 mm, 5% diphe-nylsiloxane, 95% dimethylsiloxane 0.25 \u03bcm). The temperature gradient program was 3 min, 80 \u00b0C, a ramp with 5 \u00b0CminNone 1 up to 325 \u00b0C and finally 325 \u00b0C for 2 min. The MS transfer line temperature to the quadruple was set to 250 \u00b0C and the electron impact (EI) ion source temperature was 220 \u00b0C. The spectra were recorded with a scanning range of 50\u2013750 mzNone 1. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was done using an Agilent 6220 accurate-mass TOF LC/MS with Hypersil Gold C18 (50 mm\u00d72.1 mm, 1.9 \u03bcm particle size), eluent A: H2O: CH3CN:HCOOH=95:5:0.1 and eluent B: H2O:CH3CN: HCOOH=5:95:0.1 with a gradient from 0 to 98% B over 9 minutes. Purification of the compounds was performed by preparative HPLC on a LaChrom System (Merck Hitachi) equipped with a Phenomenex Jupiter column (10 mm, C18, 300 \u00c5, 250\u00d721.1 mm, solvent A H2O:CH3CN:TFA=95:5:0.1, solvent B H2O:CH3CN:TFA=5:95:0.1, using a flowrate of 10 mLminNone 1 and gradient from 0\u2013100% B over 50 min). For compounds insoluble in acetonitrile, another solvent system was used with A H2O:CH3OH:TFA=95:5:0.1, solvent B H2O: CH3OH:TFA=5:95:0.1, flowrate 10 mLminNone 1 using a gradient from 0\u2013100% B over 50 min. Preparative thin layer chromato-graphy (PTLC) was used for small amounts of products using CH3OH:DCM=3:97. NMR spectra were recorded using Avance DRX-500 (1H: 500 MHz, 13C: 125 MHz) or Avance 600 (1H: 600 MHz, 13C: 151 MHz) at 298 K. Chemical shifts were referenced to residual solvent peaks (CD3OD: 1H: 3.31 ppm; 13C: 49.0 ppm, DMSO-d6: 1H: 2.50 ppm). PrnF and ADH Activity Flavin reductase PrnF from Pseudomonas fluorescens activity was determined in triplicates by monitoring the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ at \u03bb=340 nm (\u025b=6.3 mLmmolNone 1 cmNone 1). The reactions were done in 1 mL volume containing 100\u00d7diluted PrnF, 10 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4, 50 \u03bcm FAD and 160 \u03bcm NADH at 25 \u00b0C. Similarly, the activity of the alcohol dehydrogenase FULL PAPER asc.wiley-vch.de Adv. Synth. Catal. 2019, 361, 2475\u20132486 \u00a9 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim2483 from Rhodococcus ruber was based on the reduction of NAD+ to NADH+H+ at \u03bb=340 nm. The reaction was conducted in 1 mL volume containing 10 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) isopropanol, 100 \u03bcm NAD+ and 100 times diluted ADH. In both assays, the conversion rate of the substrate was determined by regression of the linear range 0\u201320 s. Reactions were conducted in triplets in a quartz cuvette with 10 mm light path. Substrate and Halide Specificity Reactions were done in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl containing 1 mm substrate, 30 mm NaBr, NaCl or NaI, 10 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4, 0.1 mm FAD, 0.1 mm NAD+, 5% (v/v) isopropanol, 1000 UmLNone 1 catalase, 2.5 UmLNone 1 PrnF, 1 UmLNone 1 ADH and 8.9 mol% (5 mgmLNone 1) Xcc halogenases. The reactions were incubated in a thermoshaker at 25 \u00b0C and 600 rpm for 24 h. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 \u03bcl methanol and the supernatant was analyzed by RP-HPLC, LC/MS or by GC/ MS depending on the analyte. Cross Linked Enzyme Aggregates Optimization (Combi-CLEAs) The pellet from 1.5 L E. coli culture containing the Xcc halogenase with chaperones was resuspended in 30 mL of 100 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4) and lysed three times by French Press (1000 psig). The total lysate was centrifuged (10000\u00d7g, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C) and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm Whatman filter to remove cell debris. The soluble fraction was then divided into 5 fractions. 2.5 UmLNone 1 PrnF and 1 UmLNone 1 ADH were added to each fraction and mixed thoroughly. For precipitating the protein, 3.24 g (97% saturation) of ammonium sulfate was added and mixed with a tube rotator for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Different concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.25 and 1.5% (v/ v)) were added to each fraction and mixed for additional 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The formed Combi-CLEAs were washed 3 times with 10 mL of 100 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), resuspended in the same buffer and kept at 4 \u00b0C until use. Regioselectivity Determination Reactions were conducted in a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask at 25 \u00b0C and 150 rpm. In a final volume of 150 mL containing 0.5 mm substrate, 30 mm NaBr, 10 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4, 0.1 mm FAD, 0.1 mm NAD+, 5% (v/v) isopropanol and combi-CLEAs of Xcc halogenase from 1.5 L culture, 2.5 UmLNone 1 flavin reductase (PrnF) and 1 UmLNone 1 (ADH) using the optimized glutaraldehyde concentration (1%). 1000 UmLNone 1 catalase was added daily. Reaction was monitored by RP-HPLC and stopped by filtration of the combi-CLEAs followed by purification of the brominated products. Total Turnover Number (TTN) Determination The halogenation reactions were done in triplicates in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl containing 1.7 mol% (1 mgmLNone 1) Xcc halogenase, 1 mm substrate, 30 mm NaBr, 10 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4, 0.1 mm FAD, 0.1 mm NAD+, 5% (v/v) isopropanol, 1000 UmLNone 1 catalase, 2.5 UmLNone 1 PrnF and 1 UmLNone 1 ADH at 25 \u00b0C for 12 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 200 \u03bcl methanol and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Product formation was calculated based on the decrease in peak area of the substrate compared to a corresponding calibration curve of each substrate. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco-810 CD-spectrometer with a Peltier temperature controller and a scanning speed of 100 nmminNone 1. The measurements were performed in triplicates in a rectangular quartz cuvette with an optical path length of 1 mm at varying temperatures (25\u201385 \u00b0C). After IMAC purifica-tion of the halogenases, the buffer was exchanged to 10 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4 using 10 kDa cutoff Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units to remove NaBr and imidazole and the protein concentration was adjusted to 8.9 \u03bcm (0.5 mgmLNone 1). Thermal Stability of the Xcc Halogenases Reactions were conducted at different temperatures (25, 30, 37, and 45 \u00b0C) in a final volume of 600 \u03bcl, containing 5.7 mol% (1.6 mgmLNone 1) Xcc halogenase, 0.1 mm FAD, 0.5 mm indole, 30 mm NaBr, 10 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4 and 20 mm 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as NADH analog.[35] The reac-tions were stopped at distinct time intervals by addition of equal volumes of methanol, centrifuged and analyzed with RP-HPLC.

        "Abstract: Flavin-dependent halogenases selectively introduce halogen substituents into (hetero-)aromatic substrates and require only molecular oxygen and halide salts for this regioselective oxidative CH-functionalization. Genomic analysis of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100 identified three novel putative members of this enzyme class. They were shown to introduce halogen substituents into, e. g., substituted indoles, while preferring bromide over chloride.",

        "Regioselective activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds is a valuable but also challenging approach to build up larger molecule structures and to incorporate functional groups in organic scaffolds for further derivatization. The regioselective incorporation of halogen substitu-ents in aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds con-veniently allows a plethora of follow-up transforma-tions like metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions or nucleophilic substitutions. Halogenation by chemical synthesis requires molecular halogen and in the case of aromatic substrates, corrosive Lewis acid catalysts. Regioselectivity often is the key challenge and not always easy to achieve.[1,2]",
        "Nature has evolved several strategies to generate halogenated natural products with interesting biolog-ical activities.[3] In many cases, both the type and the position of the halogen substituent in such metabolites exert a great influence on the biological activity.[4] Halogenated secondary metabolites with antibacterial, antifungal, or antitumor activity have been isolated from different organisms like bacteria, fungi, algae or plants,[5\u20138] which sparked investigations on their bio-synthesis, in particular on the key step, the enzymatic halogenation.[9]",
        "As chloride is the most abundant halide in the geosphere, chlorinated natural products prevail over other halogenated compounds. Enzymatic halogenation follows different chemical strategies and the halogen-ases can thus be classified according to their mecha-nisms of action. Fluorinases utilize fluoride for halogenation by nucleophilic substitution, but are limited to a few substrates.[10] \u03b1-Ketoglutarate-depend-ent halogenases introduce halide substituents (chloride, bromide) regioselectively even at non-activated ali-phatic positions via a radical mechanism and usually require a substrate bound to a carrier protein.[11\u201313] Haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases generate hypohalous acid from halide salts for aro-matic electrophilic substitution (SEAr). While haloper-oxidases use hydrogen peroxide for that purpose,[14] flavin-dependent halogenases convert molecular oxy-gen into a flavin hydroperoxide intermediate.[9]",

        "relies on halide salts and oxygen under ambient conditions certainly is a \u2018dream reaction\u2019 of organic chemistry. However, not all available halogenases meet the requirements with respect to specificity and selectivity: Haloperoxidases release freely diffusible hypohalous acid and, hence, lack selectivity.[9,15]",
        "Dairi et al. identified in 1995 the gene encoding an enzyme responsible for the chlorination of tetracycline that did not display any resemblance to halo-peroxidases.[16] Few years later, a second member of this novel enzyme class was identified in Pseudomonas fluorescens BL915 and was named PrnA. It is a flavin-dependent halogenase that is involved in the biosyn-thesis of pyrrolnitrin.[17]",
        "Flavin-dependent halogenases like PrnA catalyze halogenation of aromatic substrates with high specifi-city and regioselectivity, often regardless the presence of a directing group within the substrate.[18] Some of these enzymes are involved in polyketide synthesis or non-ribosomal peptide synthesis and require a carrier-bound substrate, while others accept soluble substrates.[19\u201321] Subsequent to the discovery of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA, several other flavin-dependent halogenases have been characterized; e. g. KtzQ and KtzR from actinobacteria Kutzneria Sp. that are involved in the dichlorination at C6 and C7 position of tryptophan during the biosynthesis of the antifungal natural product kutzneride.[22] PyrH from Streptomyces rugosporus halogenates tryptophan at position 5 in pyrroindomycin biosynthesis.[23] RebH from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes catalyzes regiose-lective halogenation of tryptophan at position 7 in the rebeccamycin biosynthesis.[24] Thal, another flavin-dependent halogenase involved in the biosynthesis of thienodolin in Streptomyces albogriseolus, was found to regioselectively chlorinate and brominate tryptophan at position 6.[25]",
        "In all flavin-dependent halogenases conserved se-quence signatures and structural features were distin-guished. They are believed to play an important role in the identification and mechanism of action of this enzyme group. For instance, the presence of the motif GxGxxG within the flavin binding domain that is also conserved in all flavin-dependent enzymes plays an important role in binding of the flavin cofactor to the enzyme. Another motif, WxWxIP, located at the flavin binding domain, is believed to block binding of the substrate near the flavin cofactor, and hence to prevent halogenases from functioning as monooxygenases.[21,26]",
        "The groups of van P\u00e9e and Walsh pioneered the discovery and characterization of flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases and largely contributed to the elucidation of the enzyme mechanism.[27,28] The reac-tion proceeds through the oxidation of the reduced flavin cofactor (FADH2) with molecular oxygen gen-erating a C4\u03b1-hydroperoxyflavin (FAD-OOH). This reactive intermediate is attacked by the halide nucleo-phile to form hypohalous acid (HOX). The crystal structure[29,30] reveals that HOX has to diffuse through a 10 \u00c5 long tunnel that separates the flavin binding site from the active site pocket. The proposal of HOX reacting with a conserved active site lysine residue generating an N-haloamine as halogenating agent is still under debate.[27] The Wheland complex formed upon attack of the halonium electrophile on the aromatic substrate is subsequently deprotonated by a conserved glutamate residue generating the halogen-ated product (Scheme 1).[30\u201334]",
        "In general, flavin-dependent halogenases exhibit low to moderate activity.[35] A recent theoretical study attempting to identify the possible mechanism of the halogenation reaction revealed that one of the rate limiting steps is the deprotonation of the Wheland intermediate by a glutamate residue.[36] The flavin binding domain on the other hand also influences the rate of hypohalous acid generation and its transfer to the active site and, hence, the overall rate of halogen-ation reaction.",

        "and pocket control substrate access and orientation. Hence, the position of halogenation mainly is inde-pendent from the presence of directing groups within the aromatic ring.[26,33] Because of these key advan-tages, FAD-dependent halogenases recently attracted more and more attention as valuable biocatalysts for chemical transformations. Investigations on novel halogenases or engineering the existing ones, for broader substrate scope, enhanced activity, and stabil-ity have been conducted.[18,37\u201341]",
        "Xanthomonas comprises a group of Gram negative Proteobacteria infecting over 350 monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species.[42] The plant patho-gen Xanthomonas campestris (Xcc) is a member of this group infecting crucifers like cabbage and cauliflower. It causes black rot disease by invading the vascular tissue of the host plant.[42] They produce a character-istic yellow pigment called xanthomonadin, a mixture of brominated aryl polyene esters considered as a chemotaxonomic feature for Xanthomonas sp.[43] In addition, they secret the exopolysaccharide xanthan, commercially known as xanthan gum. It is employed, e. g., as thickening agent and emulsifier in food and pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, xanthomonads are considered an important group of bacteria for their commercial, biotechnological application and their economic importance as plant pathogen.[44,45] Besides, they might be a source for novel halogenases, considering the brominated xanthomonadin, with new substrate spectrum.",
        "Results and Discussion In the frame of our studies directed towards the discovery of novel halogenases, we investigated three novel putative flavin-dependent tryptophan halogen-ases, identified and cloned from the genome of the xanthan producing Xanthomonas campestris pv. cam-pestris B100 strain.[46]",
        "Identification of Xcc Halogenases The whole genome of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strain B100[46] (Accession no.: PRJNA436896) was screened for the signature motifs GxGxxG and WxWxIP present in the FAD binding domain and that are consensus and characteristic for the whole flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases. Three genes were identified and annotated as trypto-phan halogenases, namely xcc-b100_1333, xcc-b100_ 4156, and xcc-b100_4345. However, further structural and functional characterization was necessary to confirm their class and activity. Expression of Xcc Halogenases",
        "In order to verify the results of the gene annotation, the three putative halogenases were produced recombi-nantly in E. coli as previously reported for other cases with co-expression of the chaperons groES and groEL. Under these conditions, all halogenases were obtained in soluble form.[47,48] SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins indicated a molecular mass of ~60 kDa for Xcc4156, while Xcc1333 and Xcc4345 have lower molecular masses of ~55 kDa matching the calculated values of 58 kDa for Xcc4156 and 56 kDa for both Xcc1333 and 4345 (Figure S1). The Xcc halogenases were further analyzed biochemically using the monochlorodimedon assay[29] to exclude haloperox-idase activity. In this assay, the activity of the halogenase can be monitored photometrically due to the halogenation of an artificial substrate, monochlor-odimedon, which readily reacts in solution with HOX to give its geminal dihalogenated derivative.[49] In a reaction mixture containing monochlorodimedon, the flavin cofactor, flavin reductase PrnF and alcohol dehydrogenase (enzymatic regeneration system) were excluded (Scheme 1). No halogenation of monochloro-dimedon could be detected in presence and absence of the Xcc halogenases.",
        "Although their natural substrates are still unknown, the Xcc halogenases share a high pairwise identity to tryptophan halogenases like RebH, PrnA and PyrH (Figure S2). Therefore, tryptophan and indole deriva-tives were selected for a preliminary substrate screen-ing. In addition, different halide salts (NaCl, NaBr, NaI) were investigated for the halogenation of the accepted substrates. Initial screening revealed that bromination of indole and some indole derivatives was possible, but not chlorination. Tryptophan surprisingly was not accepted by all three halogenases, despite their annotation as tryptophan halogenases. Hence, indole was used as a substrate for further optimization. A buffer screening showed that 50 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 7.4 led to the highest halogenase activity (Fig-ure S3).",
        "The storage stability of the purified enzymes at 4 \u00b0C was also investigated using indole as substrate. Activity was retained for more than three weeks, leading to 100% conversion of 1 mm indole using 21 mol% (12.4 mgmLNone 1) of Xcc halogenases.",
        "Substrate Screening Based on the initial results, a larger array of com-pounds was selected for a more elaborate substrate screening (Scheme S1). Enzymatic conversion was monitored by RP-HPLC, RP-HPLC-MS, and GC-MS to identify halogenated products. Besides using chloride as halide source, a particular interest was placed on bromide. Notably, the Xcc halogenases",

        "investigated were found to exclusively brominate the substrates indole, 7-azaindole, 5-hydroxytryptophan, tryptophol and other heterocyclic derivatives, even in the presence of an excess of chloride (Table 1). Although the three enzymes share little identity on the sequence level (49\u201350%), they showed nearly similar substrate scope.",
        "Regioselectivity of Enzymatic Halogenation The reactions were scaled up and performed on a semi-preparative scale to determine the regioselectivity of the enzymatic halogenation. Each Xcc halogenase was precipitated with ammonium sulfate together with the auxiliary enzymes PrnF and ADH and immobilized with glutaraldehyde to yield cross linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA).[50,51] This approach was success-fully applied in previous studies for the upscaling of enzymatic halogenation using the tryptophan 7-halo-geanse RebH.[52]",
        "The optimal glutaraldehyde concentration for the different halogenases was determined, as excessive cross-linking may lead to loss of enzymatic activity. 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde was found to yield the highest conversion among the other tested glutaraldehyde percentages (Figure S4). Furthermore, the resulting CLEAs could be re-used in three batches while retaining halogenase activity (Figure S4).[53]",
        "Several substrates could be halogenated using halogenase-CLEAs in sufficient amounts for structural elucidation by NMR spectroscopy, whereas other substrates were hardly converted (Table 1). Among all substrates tested so far, indole led to the highest conversions. MS analysis confirmed product forma-tion, also showing the typical isotope pattern com-monly observed for monobrominated compounds (Scheme 2). This is also true for the rest of the brominated substrates. NMR analysis revealed C3 as bromination site, which is the electronically most favoured position for electrophilic substitution in the indole ring.[47] Notably, previous studies on the sub-strate scope of the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH also showed chlorination of indole at the C3 position of the pyrrole ring.[54]",
        "In the halogenase, FADH2 efficiently reacts with molecular oxygen to form a flavin-hydroperoxide. This reactive intermediate leads to hypohalous acid forma-tion which subsequently halogenates the substrate. However, hydrolysis of the flavin-hydroperoxide re-sults in the release of H2O2. This uncoupling side reaction is commonly observed in flavin-dependent enzymes like monooxygenases and halogenases (\u201coxy-gen dilemma\u201d).[55\u201357] It leads to a loss of reducing equivalents required for product formation, while forming H2O2 as a strong oxidant. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to affect e. g. the stability of dehydrogenases by oxidation of cysteine and methionine residues.[58\u201360] The oxygen dilemma can be levied by addition of superoxide dismutase or catalase to the reaction. Therefore, it was important to add catalase to the preparative scale halogenation reactions for H2O2 elimination.",
        "Indole bromination by the Xcc halogenases was found to proceed efficiently only after portionwise (e.g. daily) addition of catalase (Figure 1) to decom-pose hydrogen peroxide.[61] Without daily addition of catalase, the reaction was observed to stop, most likely due to halogenase and dehydrogenase inhibition. Attempts to co-immobilize catalase together with Xcc halogenase, flavin reductase and alcohol dehydrogen-ase revealed the instability of the immobilized catalase over time. After 4\u20135 days, the reaction rate declines",
        "Table 1. Total turnover number and regioselectivity of the three flavin-dependent halogenases with the brominated substrates.",
        "and stops completely if no additional catalase is added to the reaction. This observation provides additional evidence that the Xcc halogenases do not belong to the class of haloperoxidases that utilize H2O2 to generate hypohalous acid in solution for non-regioselective halogenation. A control experiment using immobilized flavin reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase with the daily addition of catalase, but omitting the halogenase, confirmed that bromination is halogenase dependent.",
        "The regioselectivity of the novel enzymes was investigated by selecting a panel of substrates based on different substituent patterns and electronic character-istics. While indole is being accepted by all enzymes leading to the formation of 3-bromoindole, C3-sub-stituted indoles (tryptophol, 3-formylindole, 3-(3-in-dolyl)propionic acid, (3-indolyl)acetonitrile) were con-verted only sluggishly. As the conversion of these 3-substituted substrates is low, only some products could be isolated in sufficient yields for structure elucidation. These compounds were shown to be brominated at the electronically unfavoured C7 position (Scheme 3, Fig-ure S5).[48,54] Despite the higher reactivity of the C2 position of the pyrrole ring, the regioselectivity of the enzyme plays a role in directing the halogenation to the less reactive C7 position instead. Indole derivatives with substituents at the benzene ring like 5-hydroxy-indole are only accepted by Xcc4156. 5-methylindole is accepted by each of Xcc4345 and 1333 with low to moderate activity, whereas 5-cyanoindole is sluggishly brominated by all three halogenases. Noteworthy, 7-azaindole and also 3-formylindole could be halogen-ated to a small extent with Xcc4156 (Table 1), however providing insufficient amounts for NMR analysis. 5-Hydroxytryptophan, whose C3 position is substituted with the amino acid backbone, was brominated in the C6 position. This is in agreement with the ortho-directing effect exerted by the hydroxyl functionality (Figure S6).[48]",
        "Docking and molecular dynamics simulation stud-ies with tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan on the Xcc4156 confirmed that both substrates can access the",
        "Scheme 2. (A) Scheme for the enzymatic bromination of indole",
        "active site. In contrast to 5-hydroxytryptophan, trypto-phan binding was not stabilized by hydrogen bonding or other interactions within the active site throughout the simulation time (1 ns, data not shown). This explains the inability of the Xcc halogenases to brominate tryptophan. The hydroxyl group of 5-hydroxytryptophan is involved in the formation of a hydrogen bond with Glu337. This is also true for other tryptophan halogenases (RebH and PyrH) where tryptophan is stabilized by hydrogen bonding, main-taining its correct positioning within the active site for the halogenation to occur.[30]",
        "On the other hand, dibromination products of 5-methylindole and 5-hydroxyindole could also be explained in the same sense. The stability of these substrates within the active site is more enhanced by their small size, facilitating the accessibility to the active site pocket. In addition, the presence of substituents like a hydroxyl group enables the inter-action (by H-bonding formation) with amino acid residues within the active site. At the same time, these substituents also increase the electron density of the substrate to promote SEAr. Nevertheless, a crystal structure of the novel halogenases soaked with these substrates would help understanding the selectivity issues.",
        "Halogenation via SEAr usually follows mesomeric and/or inductive effects of the substituents that influence the electron density in the aromatic ring and hence the site of halogenation. When the most nucleophilic C3 position of the indole ring is occupied, bromination takes place in the six-membered ring and in case of 5-hydroxytryptophan the hydroxyl group directs bromination to the C6 position due to its positive mesomeric effect. Similarly, phenol is bromi-nated in the electronically favored para position. However, if the C3 position of indole is unsubstituted, bromination takes place there, regardless of the substituents present on the benzene ring. This was observed with indole-5-carbaldehyde brominated with Xcc1333, as well as 5-cyanoindole brominated with both Xcc1333 and 4345. By blocking the electronically favored position 3 in the pyrrole ring for the electro-philic aromatic substitution and the absence of direct-ing substituents on the benzene ring halogenation takes place at the C7 position. This was observed with all three halogenases in the case of tryptophol and 3-(3-indolyl)propionic acid with Xcc4345 and 1333 (Ta-ble 1).",
        "Total Turnover Number (TTN) The total turnover number of the novel halogenases was determined to obtain information on the efficiency of the enzymes towards different substrates (Table 1). All enzymes display a relatively moderate to low TTN towards the tested substrates with values between 0 and 60. Remarkably, 5-hydroxytryptophan is converted by Xcc4345 with a TTN of 12, whereas tryptophan is not accepted by any investigated halogenase. In general, the TTN is higher for indole, 5-methylindole and 5-hydroxyindole, which indicates that indole, indole derivatives or smaller heterocyclic compounds accommodate better within the active site. Bulky",

        "substituents are less tolerated according to the observed TTN (Figure S7).",
        "Thermostability of Xcc Halogenases Temperature is an important factor affecting the enzymatic activity and increased thermal stability of enzymes may be associated with improved turnover. Xcc4156 was found to be temperature sensitive and even at 30 \u00b0C the activity was largely reduced. Xcc1333 showed higher stability; with 23, 35, and 18% conversion of indole as substrate at 25, 30, and 37 \u00b0C after 7 hours of reaction time, respectively. Xcc4345 showed lower activity at 30 \u00b0C and the activity was dramatically reduced at 37 \u00b0C (Figure 2,",
        "S8). All Xcc halogenases were not active at 45 \u00b0C and precipitated. The stability profile of the three halogen-ases aligns with the observed TTN, where Xcc1333 showed the highest TTN against most of the tested substrates (Table 1).",
        "The protein stability was also investigated using circular dichroism spectroscopy and melting temper-atures (Tm) of 46 \u00b0C and 47 \u00b0C were determined for Xcc4345 and Xcc4156, respectively, while Xcc1333 has a slightly higher Tm of 54 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the observed conversions at elevated temperature.",
        "Homology Model and Structural Analysis of Xcc Halogenases A homology model was established to provide information on the 3D structure and to enable align-ment studies with other related enzyme structures. Blast analysis of Xcc4156, 1333 and 4345 sequences revealed the most related structures to the target sequence. The highest identity sequences for Xcc4156 were RebH with 33.6% and PrnA with 32.3% identity. Xcc1333 showed 33.1% identity to PyrH and 31% to RebH. Xcc4345 showed 36.0%, 35.8% and 32.9% identity to PyrH, PrnA, and RebH, respectively. Though the sequence identity was relatively low, it was confirmed that the Xcc enzymes have an FAD binding site and the active site residues conserved for flavin-dependent halogenases.",
        "Hybrid homology models of Xcc4156 and 1333 were based on combined parts from 25 models built by YASARA Structure. Analysis of the built model was performed after aligning with apo-RebH, PyrH and PrnA, soaked with the substrate tryptophan and the flavin cofactor. It was assumed that the structures of Xcc4156 and Xcc1333 combine features of both RebH and PrnA.[30] One prominent difference compared to RebH concerns the loop (residues 40\u201348) covering bound FAD. In case of RebH, this loop is oriented away from the FAD, leaving it exposed to the surrounding environment. However, in case of Xcc1333 the loop (residues 41\u201319) covers FAD in a similar fashion as in PrnA. This is also true for Xcc4156 with slight structural deviation at the allox-azine moiety of FAD binding site. As a result of insertion and deletion, the \u03b1-helix covering the active site entrance in tryptophan halogenases is shorter in the Xcc halogenases, where a loop exists leaving the active site pocket exposed. Xcc1333 however, has a longer loop compared to Xcc4156, which might rigid-ify upon substrate binding covering the active site (Figure 3).",
        "Obviously, the presence of such loops within the enzyme structure and in particular at the active site entrance may influence substrate specificity and kinetic characteristics of the enzyme. This was observed for RebH (PDB entry: 2OA1), where the \u03b1-helix covering the active site directly interacts with the substrate tryptophan forming hydrogen bonds with residues Tyr454, Glu461, Tyr455 and Phe465. The absence of such interactions in Xcc halogenases explains their inability to catalyze tryptophan halogenation.",
        "Besides that, bulky residues are found within the active site of Xcc4156 and Xcc1333 that differ from tryptophan halogenases RebH. For instance, Ser434 in Xcc1333 is substituted by the polar residue Asn, while Phe430 in Xcc1333 is substituted by Trp and Val379 by Thr. In addition to the structural and residual differences within the active site, similar residues in both enzymes are found in different orientation towards or away from the active site cavity. Those changes would affect the interaction, orientation and stabilization of the substrates and hence affect substrate specificity and regioselectivity (Table S1).",

        "Further sequence analysis for Xcc4156 was per-formed in comparison with the sequences of other tryptophan halogenases; PyrH (GenBank: AAU95674.1), PrnA (GeneBank: AAB97504), Thal (GeneBank: ABK79936.1) and RebH (GeneBank: Q8KHZ8) (Figure S2). Notably, the signature motifs for FAD-dependent halogenases GxGxxG and WxWxIP, both highly conserved in all tryptophan halogenases, are present in the three Xcc halogenases as well.[26,29] In addition, the conserved residues that are believed to be directly involved in the halogenation within the active site, a distinct Lys and Glu residue, are also present in the three Xcc halogenases.[33]",
        "The homology models built for Xcc4156 and Xcc1333 provided detailed insight into the active site pocket geometry. The three novel enzymes have 40\u2013 50% pairwise sequence identity within the active site and its surrounding. Nevertheless, a profound insight within the active site pocket and the residues that might be involved in the substrate binding, have revealed very high identity (>90%) with similar residues explaining the similar substrate specificity and regioselectivity of Xcc halogenases (Table S1).",
        "Conclusion Three putative flavin-dependent halogenase genes from different locations of the Xanthomonas campest-ris genome show high similarity to flavin-dependent halogenase genes with respect to the flavin binding site and active site residues. Despite having been annotated as tryptophan halogenases, the enzymes do not accept tryptophan as a substrate. The lack of the required interactions to stabilize tryptophan within the active site pocket might give an explanation. On the contrary, 5-hydroxytryptophan is being brominated as a result of a hydrogen bond formed between its hydroxyl group and Glu337. Indole and substituted indoles are being accepted. However, for bulkier substrates lower TTN was detected. Biochemical characterization revealed the ability of the halogenases to exclusively brominate their substrates, even in the presence of excess chloride salt. A difference in the amino acid residues surround-ing the halide binding site could explain the bromide preference. However, the 10 \u00c5 tunnel connecting the FAD binding domain and the active site pocket could have an influence on the accessibility of the hypoha-lous acid for a selective transport towards the active site. Further structural characterization via site directed mutagenesis might help revealing the reason for bromide selectivity and also alter the substrate selectivity and enzymatic activity. Despite the low reaction rates exhibited by halogenases, they still accomplish regioselective halogenation reactions diffi-cult to be effected by other conventional chemical approaches. The structural and biochemical investiga-tion of the novel halogenases have expanded our knowledge on the flavin-dependent halogenases and will assist exploiting the enzymatic halogenation reactions.",
