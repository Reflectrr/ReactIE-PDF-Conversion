Vaillancourt1*, Ellen Yeh1*, David A. Vosburg1\u2020, Sarah E. O\u2019Connor1\u2020 & Christopher T. Walsh1 Enzymatic incorporation of chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms occurs during the biosynthesis of more than 4,000 natural products1. Halogenation can have significant consequences for the bioactivity of these products so there is great interest in understanding the biological catalysts that perform these reac-tions. Enzymes that halogenate unactivated aliphatic groups have not previously been characterized. Here we report the activity of five proteins\u2014CmaA, CmaB, CmaC, CmaD and CmaE\u2014in the construction of coronamic acid (CMA; 1-amino-1-carboxy-2-ethylcyclopropane), a constituent of the phytotoxin coronatine synthesized by the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae2. CMA derives from L-allo-isoleucine, which is covalently attached to CmaD through the actions of CmaA, a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase module, and CmaE, an unusual acyltransfer-ase. We show that CmaB, a member of the non-haem Fe21 , a-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme superfamily, is the first of its class to show halogenase activity, chlorinating the g-position of L-allo-isoleucine. Another previously undescribed enzyme, CmaC, catalyses the formation of the cyclopropyl ring from the g-Cl-L-allo-isoleucine product of the CmaB reaction. Together, CmaB and CmaC execute g-halogenation followed by intramol-ecular g-elimination, in which biological chlorination is a cryptic strategy for cyclopropyl ring formation. Coronatine is a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide leaf toxin containing CMA, a cyclopropyl amino acid, itself derived from the non-proteinogenic allo diastereomer of L-isoleucine3,4 (Fig. 1a). A variant of coronatine containing norcoronamic acid (norCMA) derived from L-valine is also produced in low quantities5. Although the source of L-allo-Ile in P. syringae is not known, a cluster of cma genes2,6 is responsible for generating CMA from L-allo-Ile by using non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules (Fig. 1b). Multimodular NRPS enzymes sequester amino-acid monomers through thioester linkage to the phosphopantetheinyl prosthetic group of carrier-protein domains. Downstream domains or dedi-cated tailoring enzymes may then catalyse modifications of the tethered monomer or peptide bond formation between monomers. Previously, CmaA, which contains NRPS adenylation (A) and thiolation (T) domains, was shown to activate L-allo-Ile as the AMP ester and install it on the 10-kDa T domain6. We now assign functions to CmaB, CmaC, CmaD and CmaE and reveal the underlying enzymatic logic by which unactivated carbon centres are functionalized by halogenation to facilitate cyclopropyl formation. CmaD is a stand-alone 8-kDa T domain that lacks a corresponding A domain but may be aminoacylated in trans by the A domain of CmaA (see Supplementary Table S2 for kinetic data of the CmaA A domain). After heterologous expression, apo-CmaD is modified post-translationally with the phosphopantetheine arm to generate the holo form of the carrier domain. However, CmaA was unable to transfer L-allo-[3H]Ile or L-[14C]Val in the presence of ATP to CmaD, because no radioactivity was associated with the acid-precipitated protein. However, after the addition of CmaE, a 32-kDa protein with homology to the a/b hydrolase superfamily, covalent attachment of these amino acids to CmaD was detected. Autoradiography of the labelled proteins shows time-dependent labelling of CmaA followed by transfer of L-[14C]Val to CmaD by the action of CmaE (Fig. 2a; see Supplementary Methods for detailed assay protocol). A functional CmaA T domain is required because no labelling of CmaD was observed when the S542A variant of CmaA was used for transfer (Ser 542 is the site of modification for the phosphopantetheine attachment; Fig. 2b). CmaE is a previously undescribed acyltransfer-ase that shuttles amino acid groups between T domains. Because LETTERS Figure 1 | Biosynthesis of CMA and coronatine. a, The biosynthesis of coronatine from L-allo-Ile. b, The generation of CMA-S-CmaD from L-allo-Ile by CmaA, CmaB, CmaC, CmaD and CmaE. 1Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. \u2020Present address: Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA (S.E.O.); Department of Chemistry, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, California 91711, USA (D.A.V.). *These authors contributed equally to this work. Vol 436|25 August 2005|doi:10.1038/nature03797 1191 \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group CmaE itself becomes labelled during the reaction, formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate through the active-site cysteine (Cys 105) is probably involved. Consistent with this was our observation that loading of CmaD in trans is abolished when the variant C105A of CmaE is tested for transfer (Fig. 2b). As discussed below, CmaD, but not the T domain of CmaA, is able to present aminoacyl groups for subsequent transformation by CmaB and CmaC. A second previously undescribed enzyme in this pathway is CmaB, which has homology to a-ketoglutarate (a-KG)-dependent non-haem Fe2\u00fe enzymes that use one Asp/Glu and two His side chains as ligands to oxygen-labile Fe2\u00fe (refs 7, 8). These enzymes typically perform oxygenation reactions, but CmaB has the highest degree of homology with other genes potentially involved in the halogenation of syringomycin E and barbamide9,10. N-His-tagged CmaB was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified under anaerobic conditions as the apo protein. After cleavage of the His tag with protease, the enzyme was reconstituted with Fe2\u00fe and a-KG. The Fe2\u00fe content of the holo protein was 81%. After in trans loading of CmaD with L-allo-[3H]Ile or L-[14C]Val, the aminoacyl-S-CmaD was incubated with reconstituted CmaB in the presence ofa-KG, Cl2 and O2. The product was released by thioesterase cleavage 11, deriva-tized to the o-phthalaldehyde/3-mercaptopropionate adduct, and analysed by radio-HPLC. Instead of the cyclopropane-containing CMA (from L-allo-Ile) or norCMA (from L-Val), g-Cl-L-allo-Ile or g-Cl-L-Val, respectively, was formed as judged by co-elution with authentic standards (Fig. 3a\u2013c; see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1 for protocols and synthesis of standards) and liquid chromatography (LC)\u2013MS mass determination of the o-phthalaldehyde/3-mercaptopropionate-derivatized amino acid (Fig. 3e). When L-allo-[3H]Ile or L-[14C]Val was presented on the carrier-protein domain of CmaA, no chlorinated product could be detected. CmaB specifically recognizes aminoacyl thioester sub-strates presented on the carrier protein CmaD. Chlorinated product formation by CmaB was dependent on Fe2\u00fe , a-KG, O2 and Cl 2 (Fig. 3c). When Cl2 was provided as Na36Cl, both the released g-Cl-L-allo-Ile product (Fig. 3c) and g-Cl-L-allo-Ile-S-CmaD protein (Fig. 3d) became labelled. CmaB is therefore a non-haem Fe2\u00fe , a-KG-dependent halogenase. Non-haem Fe2\u00fe , a-KG-dependent oxygenases have been well characterized12,13. CmaB also requires O2 and a-KG for its reaction but performs chlorination rather than oxygenation at unactivated g positions of the aminoacyl substrate. A radical pathway is likely, involving the prototypic high-valent oxoiron14,15 (FeIV\u00bcO) generated in the CmaB active site from O2-dependent decarboxyla-tion of a-KG. Abstraction of a hydrogen atom, H z, from the substrate\u2019s g-position would yield the methylene radical of the substrate and a Fe3\u00fe species that could transfer Cl z or OH z to yield a halogenase (Fig. 4a) or oxygenase outcome. Transfer of a hydroxyl or chlorine radical could depend on the orientation of the proposed substrate\u2019s CH2 z (g-position) in the transition state and the placement of the OH and Cl substituents on or near the Fe. A reaction of chromyl chloride with cyclohexane gives an equal yield of Clz and OH z transfer16,17, whereas a model iron compound that probably forms an oxoiron species reacts with cyclohexane to yield the chlorinated product specifically18. The detection of substrate and chlorine radicals and identification of the iron-based chlorinating agent will be some of the future challenges for this halogenase class. In the CmaB reaction, no hydroxylation product was detected. It was not possible to determine whether substrate hydroxylation would occur in the absence of available chloride ions, because a small amount of chlorinated product is obtained even when the reaction is Figure 2 | The transfer of L-Val from CmaA to CmaD catalysed by CmaE. a, Time course of the reaction catalysed by CmaE with L-[14C]Val in the presence of CmaA and CmaD.

LETTERS NATURE|Vol 436|25 August 2005 1192 \u00a9 2005 Nature Publishing Group performed under chloride-free conditions. Cl2 seems to be retained during protein purification such that its total exclusion is not possible. The g-chlorination of L-allo-Ile and L-Val requires that the amino acids be presented as thioesters tethered to the carrier protein CmaD because free L-allo-Ile and L-Val were not chlorinated. A detailed kinetic analysis is complicated by the protein-bound linkages of substrate and product. However, by monitoring the consumption of a-[1-14C]KG, CmaB was active for 16 ^ 6 turnovers on L-allo-Ile-S-CmaD as its substrate. How CmaB recognizes the T domain of CmaD but not the T domain of CmaA remains unclear. Because formation of the a,g-cyclopropane ring in CMA and norCMA was shown to proceed through a g-chloroaminoacyl-S-CmaD intermediate, we continued our search for a catalyst that would complete the conversion of the g-chloroaminoacyl intermedi-ate to CMA or norCMA. CmaC shows sequence homology to methylmalonyl-CoA epimerases19, a member of the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily20,21, which uses the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad7,8 for binding of an active-site Co2\u00fe to generate a thioester enolate. When CmaC was overproduced and purified from E. coli, it contained a mixture of bound-metal cations in the following ratio: 0.30 equiv. Fe, 0.24 equiv. Zn, 0.11 equiv. Mn, 0.06 equiv. Ni, 0.01 equiv. Cu and 0 equiv. Co. On addition of CmaC to the CmaB-generated g-chloroaminoacyl-S-CmaD product, CMA and norCMA were formed from L-allo-[3H]Ile and L-[14C]Val, respectively (Fig. 3a, b). CmaC alone was sufficient to perform this reaction because active CmaB was not required for the final transformation. Although mechanistic analysis remains to be conducted on CmaC, including the role of divalent metal cations, it is very likely that the cyclopropane ring is formed by intramolecular attack of an enzyme-stabilized Ca carbanion on Cg to displace the chloride ion (Fig. 4b). The molecular logic of the CmaA/CmaB/CmaC/CmaD/CmaE pathway, including three previously unknown reactions, is now revealed (Fig. 1b). The A domain of CmaA activates L-allo-Ile or L-Val as an aminoacyl-AMP and then installs it by means of a thioester linkage onto the CmaA T domain. CmaE transfers the aminoacyl group from the T domain of CmaA to a second T domain, CmaD, a protein scaffold that is recognized by CmaB. Thus, the aminoacyl substrate is effectively sequestered on a dedicated carrier protein for subsequent enzymatic transformations. The chemical problem of activating the g-position of aliphatic amino acids is solved by CmaB, a unique non-haem Fe2\u00fe halogenase. By a pre-sumptive radical mechanism, enabled by the prototypic Fe4\u00fe oxo intermediate of this enzyme class, CmaB regiospecifically chlorinates the substrate at Cg. The g-Cl-aminoacyl product remains tethered to CmaD for the final enzyme, CmaC, to generate the kinetically stabilized Ca carbanion adjacent to the thioester. Intramolecular displacement of the g-Cl group yields the cyclopropyl ring. The chlorination of L-allo-Ile tethered to CmaD is cryptic in the overall pathway of cyclopropyl ring formation. Other biosynthetic clusters that form amino-carboxy-cyclopropane moieties should be inspected for a similar enzymatic strategy. Indeed, we have found such an enzyme sequence in the biogenesis of the apoptosis-inducing cytotrienin A (M. Ueki, F.H.V., S. Garneau, E.Y., D.A.V., H. Osada and C.T.W., unpublished work). Similarly, other members of the non-haem Fe2\u00fe , a-KG-dependent enzyme superfamily may be explored for halogenase activity. We have detected halogenase activity in enzyme family member SyrB2 generating the 4-Cl-L-Thr-S-enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of syringomycin22. Nature uses both FADH2-dependent and non-haem Fe 2\u00fe enzymes for hydroxylation, each titrated to the reactivity of the specific substrates23\u201325. It seems that a similar two-pronged strategy is employed for the halogenation of amino acids. For electron-rich aromatic substrates, FADH2-dependent monooxygenases generate FAD-OOH, which is sufficiently reactive for electrophilic oxygen transfer26. FADH2-dependent halogenases may form FAD-O-Cl as the proximal chlorinating agent for aromatic substrates27. For unacti-vated aliphatic carbon centres, a more potent oxygen gun in the form of high-valent oxo-iron intermediates is required and generated by Fe2\u00fe oxygenases14. For the non-haem Fe2\u00fe halogenase described here, we presume that the more potent Fe4\u00fe\u00bcO oxygen gun also becomes a more potent halogen gun. O2 undergoes reductive fragmentation in all these reactions. For substrate chlorination, O2 fragmentation is used to generate an oxidized form of chloride ion as the reactive chlorinating agent in the active site. The CMA pathway demonstrates Nature\u2019s elegant chemical logic for converting an unactivated methyl group to the methylene moiety of a cyclopropane by a cryptic chlorination strategy using five dedicated proteins. METHODS Chemicals. L-[14C]Val (250 mCi mmol21) and Na36Cl (16 mCi g21 Cl) were from American Radiolabelled Chemicals, Inc. L-[3H]allo-Ile (1 Ci mmoll21) was from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. a-[1-14C]ketoglutaric acid, sodium salt (54.5 mCi mmol2 1) and [32P]pyrophosphate were from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Inc. Coronamic acid was a gift from Ronald J. Parry. g-Cl-L-valine, g-Cl-L-allo-isoleucine and norCMA were synthesized as described in Sup-plementary Methods. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Construction of plasmids and overexpression and purification of proteins. The cmaA, cmaB, cmaC, cmaD and cmaE genes were amplified from genomic DNA of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomatoDC3000 prepared with the Bactozol kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). The oligonucleotide pairs used for PCR amplification are described in Supplementary Table S1. His-tagged Cma proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with their respective overexpression plasmids. His-tagged CmaA, CmaD and CmaE proteins were purified with Ni2\u00fe-nitrilotriacetate (Ni2\u00fe-NTA) agarose followed by gel filtration. For the CmaB and CmaC proteins, all cell-free preparations were manipulated under an inert atmosphere with an Mbraun Labmaster glovebox maintained at 2 p.p.m. O2 or less. His-tagged CmaB and CmaC were purified by Ni2\u00fe-NTA affinity chroma-tography. After proteolytic cleavage of the His tag, further purification was Figure 4 | Proposed mechanisms of CmaB and CmaC. a, Proposed mechanism of halogenation catalysed by CmaB. b, Proposed mechanism of cyclopropane formation catalysed by CmaC.

Metal analysis. The metal content of the CmaB and CmaC protein preparations was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) performed by Phytronix Technologies. In reconstitution experiments, iron concentrations were determined colorimetrically with Ferene S (ref. 29). Reconstitution of CmaB in vitro. Apo-CmaB was reconstituted anaerobically in the presence or absence of a-KG. CmaB was incubated with 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.75 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 for 30 min. The protein was desalted on a Bio-Gel P6-DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 to remove dithiothreitol and excess iron. When present, a-KG was added at 2 mM in both the initial incubation and the final storage buffer. Aminoacylation assays for self-loading of CmaA and in trans loading of CmaD. Aminoacylation of CmaA and CmaD was monitored with two methods. In the first approach, the amino acid, ATP and proteins were mixed, a time course was performed and the reaction was quenched at different time points followed by liquid-scintillation counting of the resuspended pellets. In the second approach, SDS\u2013PAGE gels of different reaction time points were performed, followed by autoradiography to measure the extent of protein labelling with L-[14C]Val. The loading of holo-CmaD was investigated in the presence and absence of CmaE with CmaA. These assays were also performed with the CmaA(S542A) and CmaE(C105A) protein variants. CmaB and CmaC activity assays. The reactions catalysed by CmaB and CmaC were investigated by incubating the enzymes with loaded CmaA with or without loaded CmaD. In incubations with loaded CmaA only, CmaA loaded with L-[3H]allo-Ile was incubated with a-KG and CmaB with or without CmaC. Chloride was present in the reaction mixture. In incubations with loaded CmaD, the latter was prepared by incubating holo-CmaA with L-[3H]allo-Ile or L-[14C]Val, CmaE and ATP. a-KG and CmaB with or without CmaC were then added. Chloride was present in the reaction mixture. The resulting reactions were transferred to 0.5 ml Ultrafree centrifugal devices equipped with a 5-kDa membrane cut-off (Millipore). The extra amino acids were removed by using four wash steps with 0.5 ml of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5. The resulting protein solution was incubated with the TycF type II thioesterase11 (5mM) to release the loaded amino acids. The amino acids were separated from the proteins by centrifuging the filter devices. The amino acids were then derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (OPA reagent) as described previously in amino acid analysis30 and analysed by radio-HPLC on a Beckman System Gold HPLC equipped with a Beckman 171 radioisotope detector and compared with authentic standards. The activities of CmaB and CmaC were also investigated on the free amino acids at a concentration of 100mM with a-KG, O2 and MgCl2 present. a-KG, Fe, O2 and chloride dependence of the CmaB reaction. The a-KG, Fe, O2 and chloride dependence of the CmaB reaction were investigated as described in Supplementary Methods. Reaction product identificationwith LC\u2013MS.The masses of the released L-allo-Ile, g-Cl-L-allo-isoleucine and coronamic acid from CmaD using the TycF thioesterase were monitored after derivatization with the OPA reagent. Reactions (300ml) of 100mM CmaD were performed with CmaB with or without CmaC. The amino acids were hydrolysed as noted above and analysed by LC\u2013MS (positive mode).

        "Enzymatic incorporation of chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms occurs during the biosynthesis of more than 4,000 natural products1. Halogenation can have significant consequences for the bioactivity of these products so there is great interest in understanding the biological catalysts that perform these reac-tions. Enzymes that halogenate unactivated aliphatic groups have not previously been characterized. Here we report the activity of five proteins\u2014CmaA, CmaB, CmaC, CmaD and CmaE\u2014in the construction of coronamic acid (CMA; 1-amino-1-carboxy-2-ethylcyclopropane), a constituent of the phytotoxin coronatine synthesized by the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae2. CMA derives from L-allo-isoleucine, which is covalently attached to CmaD through the actions of CmaA, a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase module, and CmaE, an unusual acyltransfer-ase. We show that CmaB, a member of the non-haem Fe21 , a-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme superfamily, is the first of its class to show halogenase activity, chlorinating the g-position of L-allo-isoleucine. Another previously undescribed enzyme, CmaC, catalyses the formation of the cyclopropyl ring from the g-Cl-L-allo-isoleucine product of the CmaB reaction. Together, CmaB and CmaC execute g-halogenation followed by intramol-ecular g-elimination, in which biological chlorination is a cryptic strategy for cyclopropyl ring formation.",

        "toxin containing CMA, a cyclopropyl amino acid, itself derived from the non-proteinogenic allo diastereomer of L-isoleucine3,4 (Fig. 1a). A variant of coronatine containing norcoronamic acid (norCMA) derived from L-valine is also produced in low quantities5. Although the source of L-allo-Ile in P. syringae is not known, a cluster of cma genes2,6 is responsible for generating CMA from L-allo-Ile by using non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules (Fig. 1b). Multimodular NRPS enzymes sequester amino-acid monomers through thioester linkage to the phosphopantetheinyl prosthetic group of carrier-protein domains. Downstream domains or dedi-cated tailoring enzymes may then catalyse modifications of the tethered monomer or peptide bond formation between monomers. Previously, CmaA, which contains NRPS adenylation (A) and thiolation (T) domains, was shown to activate L-allo-Ile as the AMP ester and install it on the 10-kDa T domain6. We now assign functions to CmaB, CmaC, CmaD and CmaE and reveal the underlying enzymatic logic by which unactivated carbon centres are functionalized by halogenation to facilitate cyclopropyl formation.",
        "CmaD is a stand-alone 8-kDa T domain that lacks a corresponding",
        "A domain but may be aminoacylated in trans by the A domain of CmaA (see Supplementary Table S2 for kinetic data of the CmaA A domain). After heterologous expression, apo-CmaD is modified post-translationally with the phosphopantetheine arm to generate",
        "the holo form of the carrier domain. However, CmaA was unable to transfer L-allo-[3H]Ile or L-[14C]Val in the presence of ATP to CmaD, because no radioactivity was associated with the acid-precipitated protein. However, after the addition of CmaE, a 32-kDa protein with homology to the a/b hydrolase superfamily, covalent attachment of these amino acids to CmaD was detected. Autoradiography of the labelled proteins shows time-dependent labelling of CmaA followed by transfer of L-[14C]Val to CmaD by the action of CmaE (Fig. 2a; see Supplementary Methods for detailed assay protocol). A functional CmaA T domain is required because no labelling of CmaD was observed when the S542A variant of CmaA was used for transfer (Ser 542 is the site of modification for the phosphopantetheine attachment; Fig. 2b). CmaE is a previously undescribed acyltransfer-ase that shuttles amino acid groups between T domains. Because",

        "CmaE itself becomes labelled during the reaction, formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate through the active-site cysteine (Cys 105) is probably involved. Consistent with this was our observation that loading of CmaD in trans is abolished when the variant C105A of CmaE is tested for transfer (Fig. 2b). As discussed below, CmaD, but not the T domain of CmaA, is able to present aminoacyl groups for subsequent transformation by CmaB and CmaC.",
        "A second previously undescribed enzyme in this pathway is CmaB, which has homology to a-ketoglutarate (a-KG)-dependent non-haem Fe2\u00fe enzymes that use one Asp/Glu and two His side chains as ligands to oxygen-labile Fe2\u00fe (refs 7, 8). These enzymes typically perform oxygenation reactions, but CmaB has the highest degree of homology with other genes potentially involved in the halogenation of syringomycin E and barbamide9,10. N-His-tagged CmaB was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified under anaerobic conditions as the apo protein. After cleavage of the His tag with protease, the enzyme was reconstituted with Fe2\u00fe and a-KG. The Fe2\u00fe content of the holo protein was 81%. After in trans loading of CmaD with L-allo-[3H]Ile or L-[14C]Val, the aminoacyl-S-CmaD was incubated with reconstituted CmaB in the presence ofa-KG, Cl2 and O2. The product was released by thioesterase cleavage 11, deriva-tized to the o-phthalaldehyde/3-mercaptopropionate adduct, and analysed by radio-HPLC. Instead of the cyclopropane-containing CMA (from L-allo-Ile) or norCMA (from L-Val), g-Cl-L-allo-Ile or g-Cl-L-Val, respectively, was formed as judged by co-elution with authentic standards (Fig. 3a\u2013c; see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1 for protocols and synthesis of standards) and liquid chromatography (LC)\u2013MS mass determination of the o-phthalaldehyde/3-mercaptopropionate-derivatized amino acid (Fig. 3e). When L-allo-[3H]Ile or L-[14C]Val was presented on the carrier-protein domain of CmaA, no chlorinated product could be detected. CmaB specifically recognizes aminoacyl thioester sub-strates presented on the carrier protein CmaD. Chlorinated product formation by CmaB was dependent on Fe2\u00fe , a-KG, O2 and Cl 2 (Fig. 3c). When Cl2 was provided as Na36Cl, both the released g-Cl-L-allo-Ile product (Fig. 3c) and g-Cl-L-allo-Ile-S-CmaD protein (Fig. 3d) became labelled. CmaB is therefore a non-haem Fe2\u00fe , a-KG-dependent halogenase.",
        "Non-haem Fe2\u00fe , a-KG-dependent oxygenases have been well characterized12,13. CmaB also requires O2 and a-KG for its reaction",
        "but performs chlorination rather than oxygenation at unactivated g positions of the aminoacyl substrate. A radical pathway is likely, involving the prototypic high-valent oxoiron14,15 (FeIV\u00bcO) generated in the CmaB active site from O2-dependent decarboxyla-tion of a-KG. Abstraction of a hydrogen atom, H z, from the substrate\u2019s g-position would yield the methylene radical of the substrate and a Fe3\u00fe species that could transfer Cl z or OH z to yield a halogenase (Fig. 4a) or oxygenase outcome. Transfer of a hydroxyl or chlorine radical could depend on the orientation of the proposed substrate\u2019s CH2 z (g-position) in the transition state and the placement of the OH and Cl substituents on or near the Fe. A reaction of chromyl chloride with cyclohexane gives an equal yield of Clz and OH z transfer16,17, whereas a model iron compound that probably forms an oxoiron species reacts with cyclohexane to yield the chlorinated product specifically18. The detection of substrate and chlorine radicals and identification of the iron-based chlorinating agent will be some of the future challenges for this halogenase class. In the CmaB reaction, no hydroxylation product was detected. It was not possible to determine whether substrate hydroxylation would occur in the absence of available chloride ions, because a small amount of chlorinated product is obtained even when the reaction is",

The g-chlorination of L-allo-Ile and L-Val requires that the amino acids be presented as thioesters tethered to the carrier protein CmaD because free L-allo-Ile and L-Val were not chlorinated. A detailed kinetic analysis is complicated by the protein-bound linkages of substrate and product. However, by monitoring the consumption of a-[1-14C]KG, CmaB was active for 16 ^ 6 turnovers on L-allo-Ile-S-CmaD as its substrate. How CmaB recognizes the T domain of CmaD but not the T domain of CmaA remains unclear.",
        "Because formation of the a,g-cyclopropane ring in CMA and",
        "norCMA was shown to proceed through a g-chloroaminoacyl-S-CmaD intermediate, we continued our search for a catalyst that would complete the conversion of the g-chloroaminoacyl intermedi-ate to CMA or norCMA. CmaC shows sequence homology to methylmalonyl-CoA epimerases19, a member of the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily20,21, which uses the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad7,8 for binding of an active-site Co2\u00fe to generate a thioester enolate. When CmaC was overproduced and purified from E. coli, it contained a mixture of bound-metal cations in the following ratio: 0.30 equiv. Fe, 0.24 equiv. Zn, 0.11 equiv. Mn, 0.06 equiv. Ni, 0.01 equiv. Cu and 0 equiv. Co. On addition of CmaC to the CmaB-generated g-chloroaminoacyl-S-CmaD product, CMA and norCMA were formed from L-allo-[3H]Ile and L-[14C]Val, respectively (Fig. 3a, b). CmaC alone was sufficient to perform this reaction because active CmaB was not required for the final transformation. Although mechanistic analysis remains to be conducted on CmaC, including the role of divalent metal cations, it is very likely that the cyclopropane ring is formed by intramolecular attack of an enzyme-stabilized Ca carbanion on Cg to displace the chloride ion (Fig. 4b).",
        "The molecular logic of the CmaA/CmaB/CmaC/CmaD/CmaE pathway, including three previously unknown reactions, is now revealed (Fig. 1b). The A domain of CmaA activates L-allo-Ile or L-Val as an aminoacyl-AMP and then installs it by means of a thioester linkage onto the CmaA T domain. CmaE transfers the aminoacyl group from the T domain of CmaA to a second T domain, CmaD, a protein scaffold that is recognized by CmaB. Thus, the aminoacyl substrate is effectively sequestered on a dedicated carrier protein for subsequent enzymatic transformations. The chemical problem of activating the g-position of aliphatic amino acids is solved by CmaB, a unique non-haem Fe2\u00fe halogenase. By a pre-sumptive radical mechanism, enabled by the prototypic Fe4\u00fe oxo intermediate of this enzyme class, CmaB regiospecifically chlorinates the substrate at Cg. The g-Cl-aminoacyl product remains tethered to CmaD for the final enzyme, CmaC, to generate the kinetically stabilized Ca carbanion adjacent to the thioester. Intramolecular displacement of the g-Cl group yields the cyclopropyl ring. The chlorination of L-allo-Ile tethered to CmaD is cryptic in the overall pathway of cyclopropyl ring formation. Other biosynthetic clusters that form amino-carboxy-cyclopropane moieties should be inspected for a similar enzymatic strategy. Indeed, we have found such an enzyme sequence in the biogenesis of the apoptosis-inducing cytotrienin A (M. Ueki, F.H.V., S. Garneau, E.Y., D.A.V., H. Osada and C.T.W., unpublished work). Similarly, other members of the non-haem Fe2\u00fe , a-KG-dependent enzyme superfamily may be explored for halogenase activity. We have detected halogenase activity in enzyme family member SyrB2 generating the 4-Cl-L-Thr-S-enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of syringomycin22. Nature uses both FADH2-dependent and non-haem Fe 2\u00fe enzymes for hydroxylation, each titrated to the reactivity of the specific substrates23\u201325. It seems that a similar two-pronged strategy is employed for the halogenation of amino acids. For electron-rich aromatic substrates, FADH2-dependent monooxygenases generate FAD-OOH, which is sufficiently reactive for electrophilic oxygen transfer26. FADH2-dependent halogenases may form FAD-O-Cl as the proximal chlorinating agent for aromatic substrates27. For unacti-vated aliphatic carbon centres, a more potent oxygen gun in the form of high-valent oxo-iron intermediates is required and generated by Fe2\u00fe oxygenases14. For the non-haem Fe2\u00fe halogenase described here, we presume that the more potent Fe4\u00fe\u00bcO oxygen gun also becomes a more potent halogen gun. O2 undergoes reductive fragmentation in all these reactions. For substrate chlorination, O2 fragmentation is used to generate an oxidized form of chloride ion as the reactive chlorinating agent in the active site. The CMA pathway demonstrates Nature\u2019s elegant chemical logic for converting an unactivated methyl group to the methylene moiety of a cyclopropane by a cryptic chlorination strategy using five dedicated proteins. METHODS Chemicals. L-[14C]Val (250 mCi mmol21) and Na36Cl (16 mCi g21 Cl) were from American Radiolabelled Chemicals, Inc. L-[3H]allo-Ile (1 Ci mmoll21) was from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. a-[1-14C]ketoglutaric acid, sodium salt (54.5 mCi mmol2 1) and [32P]pyrophosphate were from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Inc. Coronamic acid was a gift from Ronald J. Parry. g-Cl-L-valine, g-Cl-L-allo-isoleucine and norCMA were synthesized as described in Sup-plementary Methods. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Construction of plasmids and overexpression and purification of proteins. The cmaA, cmaB, cmaC, cmaD and cmaE genes were amplified from genomic DNA of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomatoDC3000 prepared with the Bactozol kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). The oligonucleotide pairs used for PCR amplification are described in Supplementary Table S1. His-tagged Cma proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with their respective overexpression plasmids. His-tagged CmaA, CmaD and CmaE proteins were purified with Ni2\u00fe-nitrilotriacetate (Ni2\u00fe-NTA) agarose followed by gel filtration. For the CmaB and CmaC proteins, all cell-free preparations were manipulated under an inert atmosphere with an Mbraun Labmaster glovebox maintained at 2 p.p.m. O2 or less. His-tagged CmaB and CmaC were purified by Ni2\u00fe-NTA affinity chroma-tography. After proteolytic cleavage of the His tag, further purification was",

Metal analysis. The metal content of the CmaB and CmaC protein preparations was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) performed by Phytronix Technologies. In reconstitution experiments, iron concentrations were determined colorimetrically with Ferene S (ref. 29). Reconstitution of CmaB in vitro. Apo-CmaB was reconstituted anaerobically in the presence or absence of a-KG. CmaB was incubated with 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.75 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 for 30 min. The protein was desalted on a Bio-Gel P6-DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 to remove dithiothreitol and excess iron. When present, a-KG was added at 2 mM in both the initial incubation and the final storage buffer. Aminoacylation assays for self-loading of CmaA and in trans loading of CmaD. Aminoacylation of CmaA and CmaD was monitored with two methods. In the first approach, the amino acid, ATP and proteins were mixed, a time course was performed and the reaction was quenched at different time points followed by liquid-scintillation counting of the resuspended pellets. In the second approach, SDS\u2013PAGE gels of different reaction time points were performed, followed by autoradiography to measure the extent of protein labelling with L-[14C]Val. The loading of holo-CmaD was investigated in the presence and absence of CmaE with CmaA. These assays were also performed with the CmaA(S542A) and CmaE(C105A) protein variants. CmaB and CmaC activity assays. The reactions catalysed by CmaB and CmaC were investigated by incubating the enzymes with loaded CmaA with or without loaded CmaD. In incubations with loaded CmaA only, CmaA loaded with L-[3H]allo-Ile was incubated with a-KG and CmaB with or without CmaC. Chloride was present in the reaction mixture. In incubations with loaded CmaD, the latter was prepared by incubating holo-CmaA with L-[3H]allo-Ile or L-[14C]Val, CmaE and ATP. a-KG and CmaB with or without CmaC were then added. Chloride was present in the reaction mixture. The resulting reactions were transferred to 0.5 ml Ultrafree centrifugal devices equipped with a 5-kDa membrane cut-off (Millipore). The extra amino acids were removed by using four wash steps with 0.5 ml of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5. The resulting protein solution was incubated with the TycF type II thioesterase11 (5mM) to release the loaded amino acids. The amino acids were separated from the proteins by centrifuging the filter devices. The amino acids were then derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (OPA reagent) as described previously in amino acid analysis30 and analysed by radio-HPLC on a Beckman System Gold HPLC equipped with a Beckman 171 radioisotope detector and compared with authentic standards. The activities of CmaB and CmaC were also investigated on the free amino acids at a concentration of 100mM with a-KG, O2 and MgCl2 present. a-KG, Fe, O2 and chloride dependence of the CmaB reaction. The a-KG, Fe, O2 and chloride dependence of the CmaB reaction were investigated as described in Supplementary Methods. Reaction product identificationwith LC\u2013MS.The masses of the released L-allo-Ile, g-Cl-L-allo-isoleucine and coronamic acid from CmaD using the TycF thioesterase were monitored after derivatization with the OPA reagent. Reactions (300ml) of 100mM CmaD were performed with CmaB with or without CmaC. The amino acids were hydrolysed as noted above and analysed by LC\u2013MS (positive mode).
