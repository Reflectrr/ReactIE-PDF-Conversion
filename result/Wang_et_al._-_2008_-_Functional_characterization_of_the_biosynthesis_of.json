The RAL radicicol is a nanomolar inhibitor of the chaperone Hsp90, whose repression leads to a combinatorial blockade of cancer-causing path-ways. Clustered genes for radicicol biosynthesis were identified and functionally characterized from the endophytic fungus Chaetomium chiversii, and compared to recently described RAL biosynthetic gene clusters. Radicicol production is abolished upon targeted inactivation of a putative cluster-spe-cific regulator, or either of the two polyketide syn-thases that are predicted to collectively synthesize the radicicol polyketide core. Genomic evidence supports the existence of flavin-dependent halo-genases in fungi: inactivation of such a putative hal-ogenase from the C. chiversii radicicol locus yields dechloro-radicicol (monocillin I). Inactivation of a cy-tochrome P450 epoxidase furnishes pochonin D, a deepoxy-dihydro radicicol analog. INTRODUCTION Fungal polyketides sharing the resorcylic acid lactone (RAL) scaffold display an impressive array of biological activities (Wins-singer and Barluenga, 2007). Zearalenone (4) (Figure 1), isolated from different Fusaria (teleomorph: Gibberella) species, is an es-trogen agonist used for growth promotion in cattle (Winssinger and Barluenga, 2007). Hypothemycin (5) (Figure 1) and similar RALs with a cis-enone moiety are highly specific inhibitors of a subset of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that co-ordinate the responses of the cell to its environment (Winssinger and Barluenga, 2007). Radicicol (1) and its natural analogs, monocillin I (2) and pochonin D (3) (Figure 1), bind to the Ber-gerat-fold ATP-binding pocket of the GHKL superfamily pro-teins, including heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (Roe et al., 1999). The chaperone Hsp90 is essential for the folding and ac-tivation of a wide range of oncogenic proteins but processes very few housekeeping enzymes. Inhibition of Hsp90 promotes the degradation of the oncogenic clients and leads to the combina-torial blockade of multiple cancer-causing pathways (McDonald et al., 2006). Hsp90 inhibitors also reduce protein aggregation in models of several neurodegenerative diseases (Luo et al., 2007) and increase thermotolerance in plants (McLellan et al., 2007). Radicicol and geldanamycin (Figure 1), a bacterial ansamycin whose derivatives are undergoing clinical trials, are competitive inhibitors binding to the same target (Roe et al., 1999). Radicicol is the most potent inhibitor of Hsp90 in vitro, but the reactivity of its epoxide group, and the sensitivity of its conjugated double bonds to Michael additions, renders it inactive in vivo (Wins-singer and Barluenga, 2007). Intensive synthetic efforts are di-rected at radicicol-like RALs that might overcome this metabolic instability (Dakas et al., 2007; Winssinger and Barluenga, 2007). Fungal polyketides are biosynthesized from malonyl-CoA pre-cursors by polyketide synthases (PKS) that resemble a single module of a bacterial type I PKS (Cox, 2007). Fungal PKSs incor-porate a single ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain for the recursive decarboxylative condensations of the precursors, covalently loaded as acyl thioesters onto the acyl carrier protein (ACP) do-main(s) by a single acyltransferase (AT) domain. Fungal nonre-ducing PKSs (nrPKSs) producing unreduced polyketide chains additionally feature an N-terminal starter unit acyltransferase (SAT) domain (Crawford et al., 2006), a centrally located product templating (PT) domain (Crawford et al., 2008a), and a C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain. Fungal highly reducing PKSs (hrPKSs) producing reduced polyketide chains do not contain SAT, PT, or TE domains but house single catalytic domains with ketoacyl reductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoyl reductase (ER) ac-tivities. Fungal nrPKSs and hrPKSs orchestrate recursive bio-synthetic processes involving the iterative use of their catalytic domains, where the programming rules that determine polyke-tide chain length, reduction (if any) of the b-ketoacyls, and the re-giospecific cyclization of the final polyketide products remain obscure (Cox, 2007). Fungal RALs contain a resorcylate moiety (derived from an unreduced polyketide chain) bridged by a 12-or 14-member macrolactone ring (derived from a reduced polyketide chain). 1328 Chemistry & Biology 15, 1328\u20131338, December 22, 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis Whereas most fungal polyketides are biosynthesized by a single PKS, the assembly of RALs requires both an hrPKS and an nrPKS, encoded by clustered genes (Gaffoor and Trail, 2006; Kim et al., 2005; Reeves et al., 2008). Thus, the zearalenone hrPKS (PKS4) was proposed to biosynthesize a reduced hexa-ketide, corresponding to C18\u2013C7. This advanced starter unit is condensed with three additional malonyl-CoA extender units on the cognate nrPKS (PKS13). The formation of the acyl resor-cylate by aldol condensation, and the release of the macrolac-tone by intramolecular ester bond formation, are also carried out by the nrPKS. The results of the recent enzymatic character-ization of PKS13 are congruent with this model, and show that PKS13 is a versatile resorcylic acid macrolactone synthase (Zhou et al., 2008). While this manuscript was in review, a report on the characterization of the hypothemycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Hypomyces subiculosus and the sequencing of a pu-tative radicicol biosynthetic locus from Pochonia chlamydospo-ria has been published, proposing similar biosynthetic models (Reeves et al., 2008). The presence of a chlorine atom at C6 contributes to the cyto-toxicity of radicicol (1) but has only a small influence on Hsp90 binding (Turbyville et al., 2006). In contrast, the dechloro analog of pochonin D (3) is attenuated in its binding to Hsp90 (Moulin et al., 2005). Although halogenated small-molecule natural prod-ucts are abundant in nature, substrate-and regiospecific halo-genase enzymes have only recently been characterized from various prokaryotic secondary metabolite producers (Neumann et al., 2008; van Pee et al., 2006). Flavin-dependent halogenases that generate hypohalite equivalents are prevalent among these enzymes (Hornung et al., 2007). Although sequence similarities indicated that the putative radicicol biosynthetic locus of P. chla-mydosporia encodes a deduced halogenase (Reeves et al., 2008), no flavin-dependent or any other substrate-and regiospe-cific halogenase enzymes have been functionally characterized from fungi. In a screening program for Hsp90 inhibitors from fungal iso-lates of the Sonoran desert, we have reisolated radicicol from Chaetomium chiversii, an endophyte of the Mormon tea (Ephe-dra fasciculata), and monocillin I from Paraphaeosphaeria quadriseptata, occurring in the rhizosphere of the Christmas cactus (Opuntia leptocaulis) (Turbyville et al., 2006). Both Figure 1. Structures of RALs and Geldana-Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis (Orf2 and Orf4) and a tricarboxylate transporter (Orf5) are also encoded in the sequenced locus (Table 1). CcRADS1, CcRADS2, and RadR Are Essential for Radicicol Biosynthesis To ascertain the function of the putative radicicol biosynthetic cluster, internal fragments of the putative PKSs ccRads1 and ccRads2, as well as the disconnected ccPks01, were replaced on the C. chiversii genome with the hph hygromycin resistance marker gene using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Zhang et al., 2003). The radR gene encoding a putative clus-ter-specific regulator was similarly targeted for gene replace-ment. Only 1%\u20135% of the hygromycin-resistant progeny origi-nated from double-homologous recombination in the targeted Table 1. Similarities of the Deduced Proteins from the C. chiversii Radicicol Biosynthetic Locus Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis genes (Figures 3A and 3B). All transformants with ectopic or ho-mologous integration of the disruption cassettes showed unal-tered morphology. Radicicol production was unaffected by ectopic integration of any of the disruption cassettes. Similarly, radicicol production was undisturbed by the targeted disruption of the ccPks01 gene (Figure 3D). However, radicicol production was completely and specifically abolished in all the isolates with the ccRads1, ccRads2 (Figures 3E and 3F), or the radR knock-outs (data not shown). Thus, the CcRADS1 and CcRADS2 PKSs and the putative RadR regulator, but not the CcPKS01 PKS, are necessary for radicicol biosynthesis in C. chiversii. Whereas the recombinant zearalenone nrPKS PKS13 was re-ported to accept short-chain fatty-acid starters from primary metabolism to produce acyl resorcylates in vivo (Zhou et al., 2008), no significant amounts of shunt products were seen to be produced by either C. chiversii RADS knockout strains. The deduced CcRADS1 (Figure 2B) is a 2431 amino acid, 263.5 kDa enzyme belonging to the fungal clade I hrPKSs (Baker et al., 2006), with 61% identity and 76% similarity to PKS4, the zearalenone biosynthetic hrPKS (ABB90283). CcRADS1 also shows 60% identity and 75% similarity to Hpm8, the hypothemy-cin hrPKS from H. subicolosus (ACD39758), and 68% identity and 81% similarity to Rdc5, the putative radicicol biosynthetic hrPKS from P. chlamydosporia (ACD39774), both described concurrently with our work (Reeves et al., 2008). These RAL hrPKSs all share identical domain compositions: KS-AT-DH-ER-KR-ACP. Their reductive domains are predicted to be fully active based on their conserved amino acid sequence motifs and the structures of the reduced polyketide portions of their RAL products. Thus, the DH domains feature the HxxxGxxxxP active site motif that encompasses part of the catalytic His/Glu dyad (Khosla et al., 2007), albeit with the central Gly shifted one amino acid to the N terminus (CcRADS1: amino acids 973\u2013985). The ER and KR domains house well-conserved NADPH-binding motifs (CcRADS1: amino acids 1848\u20131857 and 2055\u20132064, respectively), with the KR domains carrying Figure 2. The Radicicol Biosynthetic Locus Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis conserved in all RAL nrPKSs (CcRADS2: eaDHleM, amino acids 2106\u20132112; PKS13: PaDHleM, amino acids 2006\u20132012) as part of a Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad (CcRADS2: S1930, D1957, H2109) (Fujii et al., 2001; Khosla et al., 2007). The deduced RadR is a 453 amino acid protein showing sim-ilarities to various hypothetical fungal transcription factors with the pfam00170 basic region leucine zipper domain near their N terminus (RadR: amino acids 28\u201378). RadR is also similar to ZEB2 (ABB90285, 24% identity/39% similarity) that was shown to act as a transcriptional regulator for zearalenone biosynthesis in Gibberella zeae (Kim et al., 2005). Interestingly, neither the H. subicolosus hypothemycin nor the putative P. chlamydosporia radicicol biosynthetic gene cluster (Figure 2A) encodes similar regulators (Reeves et al., 2008). The amino acid sequence of RadR and the abolishment of radicicol biosynthesis in the knock-out strain are consistent with RadR being a cluster-specific pos-itive regulator for radicicol biosynthesis in C. chiversii. radH Encodes a Fungal Flavin-Dependent Halogenase The C. chiversii radicicol biosynthetic gene cluster also encodes enzymes with potential roles in post-PKS tailoring. Thus, radH encodes a 520 amino acid, 56.4 kDa protein that is highly similar to unidentified fungal proteins with the pfam04820 conserved domain like EAQ86388 of C. globosum (54% identity/70% simi-larity), and to the putative halogenase Rdc2 from P. chlamydo-sporia (ACD39771, 74% identity/84% similarity). RadH also dis-plays clear similarities to bacterial halogenases like CrpH from Nostoc sp. (ABM21576, 38% identity/58% similarity). RadH shares with bacterial flavin-dependent halogenases a FAD-bind-ing domain (pfam01494) with the nucleotide-binding motif GxGxxG (amino acids 13\u201318), and the partially overlapping pfam04820 (tryptophan) halogenase conserved domain with the WxWxIP active site cavity motif (amino acids 234\u2013239). The bulky Trp side chains have been proposed to distance the enzyme-bound substrate from the flavin hydroperoxide to Figure 3. Insertional Inactivation of ccRads1 and ccRads2 Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis prevent a direct monooxygenase reaction (Neumann et al., 2008; van Pee et al., 2006). Instead, a chloride ion bound near the co-factor attacks the oxidized flavin to produce hypochlorous acid, captured by the strictly conserved Lys (RadH: K74) as a lysine chloramine that reacts with high regiospecificity with the sub-strate (Neumann et al., 2008). Because no fungal halogenases have been experimentally characterized to date to the best of our knowledge, we sought experimental proof for the involvement of RadH in the chlorina-tion of the polyketide scaffold of radicicol by performing a di-rected gene knockout of radH. The production of radicicol was found undisturbed in isolates with ectopic integration of the dis-ruption cassette. However, radicicol production was completely abolished, and a new HPLC peak with similar, but not identical mobility to radicicol was detected in all fermentation extracts with the radH knockout isolates (Figure 4C). Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS; Fig-ure 4E) and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Supplemental Data) of the isolated compound proved that this product is 6-dechloro-radi-cicol, identical with monocillin I (2) previously isolated from vari-ous fungi (Winssinger and Barluenga, 2007). No other RAL prod-uct was detected in these fermentations. The production of the biogenetically unrelated eugenitin (peak c, Figure 4B) was also increased in many transformants, irrespective of their origin from ectopic or homologous integration. Monocillin I could not be con-verted to radicicol by feeding the isolated compound to the ccRads1 or ccRads2 knockout strains during fermentations, or during attempts to reconstitute the halogenation reaction using crude extracts prepared from these strains (Supplemental Data). However, the amino acid sequence of RadH and the production of the dechloro-radicicol analog in the corresponding knockout strain are consistent with RadH being a flavin-dependent Figure 4. Insertional Inactivation of radH and radP Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis substrate-and regiospecific halogenase that installs the chlorine atom at C6 of radicicol. radP Encodes a Putative CYP Epoxidase Another deduced tailoring enzyme found encoded in the radici-col biosynthetic cluster is RadP, a 501 amino acid, 57.2 kDa putative protein with the pfam00067 cytochrome P450 (CYP) do-main. The deduced RadP shows high similarity to a variety of CYP monooxygenases including EDU51262 from Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (43% identity/62% similarity), and the putative radicicol hydroxylase Rdc4 from P. chlamydosporia (ACD39773, 69% identity/80% similarity). RadP features the conserved Thr (T307) implicated in O2 binding (Buchatskii et al., 2001), as well as the conserved E/DxxR motif (amino acids 359\u2013362) and the conserved FxxGxHxCxGxxxA motif with the invariable Cys (amino acids 437\u2013450, C444), both involved in heme binding. Radicicol features an epoxide moiety at C14(15) that might be expected, in analogy with epothilone biosynthesis (Molna\u0301r et al., 2000), to be installed by a CYP epoxidase acting on a PKS-generated double bond. To establish the role of RadP as radicicol epoxidase, the radP gene was inactivated by di-rected gene knockout. Ectopic integrants, representing more than 99% of the transformants in this case, produced radicicol undisturbed. However, radicicol production was completely abolished in all radP knockout isolates, with the concomitant ap-pearance of a single new RAL with decreased chromatographic mobility (Figure 4D) and a significant red shift compared to radicicol (from 276 to 314 nm). This new RAL was isolated and subjected to FTICR-MS (Figure 4F), 1H NMR, and DQF-COSY spectroscopy (Supplemental Data). Although the limited amount of isolated material precluded us from obtaining 13C NMR spec-tra, the above data revealed this product to be 14(15)-deepoxy-12(13)-dihydro-radicicol, identical to pochonin D (3) previously isolated from P. chlamydosporia (Hellwig et al., 2003). Pochonin D could not be converted to radicicol by feeding the isolated compound to the ccRads1 or ccRads2 knockout strains during fermentations, or during attempts to reconstitute the epoxidation reaction using crude extracts prepared from these strains (Sup-plemental Data). However, the amino acid sequence of RadP and the production of a deepoxy-radicicol analog in the corre-sponding knockout strain are consistent with the proposed role of RadP as the radicicol C14(15) CYP epoxidase. DISCUSSION The current work describes the functional characterization of the genes for the biosynthesis of radicicol, an Hsp90 inhibitor RAL polyketide, from the endophytic fungus C. chiversii. Clustered genes encoding two PKSs, a halogenase, and a CYP were iden-tified by exploiting the expected similarity of the radicicol biosyn-thetic genes to bacterial flavin-dependent halogenases and the nrPKS and hrPKS genes for the biosynthesis of the RAL zearale-none. Targeted disruptions of the nrPKS, the hrPKS, and a puta-tive transcriptional regulator specifically abolished radicicol bio-synthesis, whereas knockout of the putative halogenase led to the production of the dechloro analog of radicicol (monocillin I). Targeted disruption of the CYP furnished a deepoxy analog that was also devoid of the C12-C13 cis double bond. Disruption of orf3 encoding a putative cystathionine g-synthase/b-lyase led to no change in radicicol production, establishing the right bor-der of the C. chiversii cluster (data not shown). Attempts to dis-rupt orf1 encoding a putative trehalose-6-phosphate synthetase at the left flank of the cluster were unsuccessful and not pursued further. The putative P. chlamydosporia radicicol biosynthetic cluster whose sequencing coincided with our work (Reeves et al., 2008) contains orthologous genes to the C. chiversii cluster (Table 1) but appears to be scrambled by two inversions (Figure 2A). The C. chiversii cluster-specific regulator, encoded by radR, is missing from the sequenced P. chlamydosporia locus. The radicicol biosynthetic machineries in both fungi must recruit an NAD(P)H-dependent flavin reductase to provide reduced cofactor for the halogenase, and a NADPH-dependent CYP re-ductase to supply electrons to the CYP. Because neither halo-genases nor CYPs require exclusive reductase partners (Molna\u0301r et al., 2005; van Pee et al., 2006), these two functions must be provided by housekeeping enzymes. No significant synteny of the C. chiversii radicicol locus was detected with the completely sequenced C. globosum genome (http://www.broad.mit.edu/ annotation/fungi/fgi/). The overwhelming majority of fungal polyketides are produced by single PKS enzymes with one set of active site domains that are used iteratively in a programmed recursive biosynthetic pro-cess. Remarkably, the biosynthesis of fungal RALs, as shown for zearalenone (Gaffoor and Trail, 2006; Kim et al., 2005), hypothe-mycin (Reeves et al., 2008), and now for radicicol, exploits both an hrPKS and an nrPKS for the biosynthesis of a single continu-ous polyketide chain. With the nrPKS utilizing the product of the hrPKS as a starter unit, the collaborating RAL PKSs represent a conceptual step toward modularity. A close parallel to RAL bio-synthesis is the assembly of norsolorinic acid, where a special-ized fatty-acid synthase (a PKS equivalent) produces a hexa-noate starter extended by an nrPKS (Crawford et al., 2008b). The biosynthesis of T toxin requires two hrPKSs to build a single linear polyketide chain (Baker et al., 2006). In contrast, the two PKS systems for lovastatin, compactin and squalestatin, pro-duce two separate polyketide chains that are conjoined via ester bonds by post-PKS tailoring enzymes (Cox, 2007). The nonaketide backbone of zearalenone and hypothemycin were proposed to be assembled, on the basis of their reduction patterns, through three rounds of nonreductive chain exten-sions on nrPKSs that use a reduced hexaketide starter from their hrPKS partners (Gaffoor and Trail, 2006; Reeves et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008). The structure of radicicol does not al-low for a similarly clear prediction. Thus, it is currently unknown whether CcRADS2 (and the putative Rdc1 from P. chlamydo-sporia) extends a b-keto hexaketide starter unit using three malonyl-CoA building blocks, or elaborates a pentaketide starter unit with four malonyl-CoA extenders (Figure 2B). A cor-relation was previously proposed between the primary se-quences of the SAT domains and their starter unit substrates (Cox, 2007; Crawford et al., 2008b), and separately between the sequences of PT domains and the number of chain exten-sions performed by the nrPKSs (Cox, 2007). The sequences of the SAT domains of the zearalenone, hypothemycin, and the two radicicol nrPKSs are remarkably similar to each other while distinct from known C2 and C6 acceptors (Crawford et al., 2008b). Similarly, the PT domains of these nrPKSs 1334 Chemistry & Biology 15, 1328\u20131338, December 22, 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis show high mutual identities, but are removed from known hex-aketide synthases like those that produce 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxy-naphthalene (BAA18956), heptaketide synthases like those that yield YWA1 (AAC39471), or octaketide synthases like those that produce norsolorinic acid (AAS66004). However, the limited number of nrPKSs with characterized starter units and product chain length specificities limits the scope of these comparisons and denies insight into the division of labor between the radici-col PKS partners. Although the first halogenating enzyme (a nonspecific chloro-peroxidase) was isolated from a filamentous fungus, no sub-strate-and regiospecific halogenases were functionally charac-terized previously from any fungal sources (van Pee et al., 2006). The radicicol biosynthetic gene clusters from C. chiversii and P. chlamydosporia each encode a putative enzyme (RadH and Rdc2, respectively) with high similarity to characterized flavin-dependent bacterial halogenases with the pfam04820 (trypto-phan) halogenase conserved domain. The targeted disruption of RadH from C. chiversii leads to the production of the 6-dech-loro analog of radicicol, monocillin I, providing to our knowledge the first functional evidence for a flavin-dependent halogenase in a fungal strain. Bacterial flavin-dependent halogenases form two subfamilies: PrnC-type halogenases acting on phenol and pyrrole moieties, and PrnA-type halogenases processing trypto-phan residues (Neumann et al., 2008; van Pee et al., 2006). A further correlation between the phylogenetic divergence of PrnC-type halogenases and their substrate chemotypes has also been noted (Hornung et al., 2007). A survey of the available 34 fungal genome sequences (http://www.broad.mit.edu/ annotation/fungi/fgi/) revealed 29 uncharacterized conserved proteins with the pfam04820 conserved domain. A phyloge-nomic analysis (Figure S1) indicates an intimate clustering of the deduced fungal pfam04820 proteins with selected bacterial PrnC-and PrnA-type halogenases (Hornung et al., 2007) with multiple clades supported by significant bootstrap values. PrnA-type bacterial halogenases acting on free Trp (Yeh et al., 2005) form the first clade basal to all other sequences, reflecting the low sequence similarity of PrnA-and PrnC-type enzymes (van Pee et al., 2006). The next clade contains selected bacterial and fungal oxidoreductases with the PRK10015 conserved do-main: PRK10015 and pfam04820 proteins belong to the same protein fold superfamily. The small fungal clade I contains pfam04820 enzymes with no functionally characterized mem-bers. Present in the Aspergillus cluster (Eurotiomycetes), Magna-porthe grisea (Sordariomycetes), Botrytis cinerea and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (both Leotiomycetes), these putative enzymes share conserved motifs with, but branch basal to, the bacterial PrnC-type halogenases. The first clade of bacterial PrnC-type halogenases includes proteins similar to the anabaenopeptolide tyrosine halogenase (CAC01605) acting on a carrier protein-bound substrate (Rouhiainen et al., 2000). The bacterial PrnC clade II includes enzymes acting on free pyrrole substrates, as well as chlorinases from the tetracycline and neocarzilin clusters modifying polyketides. The RadH radicicol halogenase (as well as the putative Rdc2 from P. chlamydosporia) belongs to the fun-gal clade II enzymes: these proteins might modify polyketides or other secondary metabolites. The phylogenetic distribution of these putative fungal halogenases is sporadic: they are present in Coprinus cinerea (Homobasidiomycetes), the Aspergillus clus-ter, and in Chaetomium and Pochonia spp. (Sordariomycetes), but are apparently absent in other Sordariomycetes like the Fusarium cluster. Finally, the bacterial clade III PrnC halogenases tailor carrier protein-bound polyketides and nonribosomal pep-tides or their CoA-bound precursors (Dorrestein et al., 2005). The only biosynthetic step not accounted for by the radicicol clusters is the synthesis of the cis double bond at C12-C13. Although PKSs almost always produce E double bonds, different mechanisms for Z double-bond formation by prokaryotic modu-lar PKS systems have been proposed (Alhamadsheh et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2004). Conceptually, the biosynthesis of cis double bonds by the iterative fungal hrPKSs is even more problematic, because a single set of active sites should yield both geometries. With only a single KR domain, the formation of cis double bonds cannot be dictated by the configuration of the hydroxyl moieties as proposed for separate A-or B-type KR domains in bacteria (Caffrey, 2003). Indeed, the KR sequences from the two radicicol hrPKSs (CcRADS1 and Rdc5) broadly correspond to B-type bacterial KRs present in modules producing E double bonds. However, a polyketide carbon chain rotation during an \u2018\u2018out of register\u2019\u2019 dehydration, as proposed for epothilone biosynthesis (Tang et al., 2004), cannot be excluded. In other prokaryotic systems, Z double-bond formation was proposed to be the result of accessory proteins that modulate the DH activity (Ikeda et al., 1999). Further, a \u2018\u2018tailoring\u2019\u2019 glutathione S-transferase was shown to equilibrate E and Z double bonds in hypothemycin analogs (Reeves et al., 2008). However, no such accessory or tailoring activities are encoded in the radicicol biosynthetic gene clusters. A comparative metabolic analysis leads us to propose a unify-ing scheme for the biosynthesis of RALs and their isocoumarin congeners in C. chiversii, P. chlamydosporia, and Pa. quadrisep-tata (Hellwig et al., 2003; Wijeratne et al., 2006). The hrPKS and the nrPKS collectively produce an ACP-bound 12(13)-dihydro-14(15)-deepoxy nonaketide (Figure 2B). After the resorcylic acid moiety is templated on the nrPKS, TE-catalyzed intramolec-ular ester bond formation yields RALs, or spontaneous or TE-catalyzed hydrolysis releases isocoumarins (Figure 5). The absence of conversion of purified pochonin D and monocillin I by PKS knockout mutants of C. chiversii or their crude protein extracts leaves open the question of whether the ACP-bound re-sorcylate thioesters or the free RALs and isocoumarins serve as substrates for the subsequent tailoring reactions (Dorrestein et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2008). Notably, in vitro reconstitution of the CYP-mediated hydroxylation of hypothemycin was similarly unsuccessful with free substrates, but proceeded in vivo using PKS-generated substrates (Reeves et al., 2008). Either way, the first tailoring reaction is an optional C6 chlorination to yield pochonin D, to our knowledge the first detected natural product from the pochonin-radicicol/chaetochiversin series. Skipping the halogenation step shunts the pathway toward the production of monocillins and paraphaeosphaerins. C14(15) epoxide forma-tion provides the known natural products monocillin III and pochonin A, still without the C12(13) cis double bond. The production of C12 a-hydroxylated natural products by Pa. quad-riseptata (hydroxymonocillin III and paraphaeosphaerin C), and the biosynthesis of pochonin B by P. chlamydosporia suggest a regio-and stereospecific hydroxylation reaction. The absence of natural RALs (or their isocoumarin analogs) with C12-OH but Chemistry & Biology 15, 1328\u20131338, December 22, 2008 \u00aa2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1335 Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis without the C14(15) epoxide moiety suggests the precedence of epoxidation over C12 hydroxylation. Because C12 corresponds to an a carbon of the relevant polyketide chain extension unit, the C12-OH cannot be derived by the PKS. It is possible, however, that RadP and its equivalents catalyze C12 hydroxylation in ad-dition to C14(15) epoxide formation: a single CYP performing two distinct but specific tailoring steps is known in pikromycin/me-thymycin biosynthesis (Xue et al., 1998). Finally, elimination of water yields the C12(13) Z double bond in the cis RALs monocillin I and radicicol, and in the cis isocoumarins paraphaeosphaerin A and chaetochiversin A. The lack of acidity of the proton at C13 in the C12-OH RALs excludes spontaneous dehydration and sug-gests that this dehydration is catalyzed by an unidentified en-zyme. The natural occurrence of the E isocoumarins para-phaeosphaerin B and chaetochiversin B suggests that these trans isocoumarins derive from a spontaneous cis/trans isomer-ization during fermentations and/or the workup of the extracts. SIGNIFICANCE The resorcylic acid lactone (RAL) scaffold constitutes a rich pharmacophore whereby different RALs act as specific in-hibitors of the stress chaperone Hsp90 or mitogen-activated protein kinases, and ligands for hormone receptors. Impor-tantly, the inhibition of the evolutionarily conserved chaper-one Hsp90 by the RAL radicicol leads to a combinatorial blockade of multiple cancer-causing pathways in vitro. The metabolic instability of radicicol, however, prevents its de-ployment for broad-spectrum cancer chemotherapy, and led to extensive combinatorial synthetic efforts to produce more stable radicicol analogs. The cloning and functional analysis of clustered genes for the biosynthesis of radicicol from the endophytic fungus Chaetomium chiversii will facil-itate combinatorial biosynthetic strategies to derive unnatu-ral radicicol analogs and other RALs. The functional identifi-cation of a pair of highly reducing and nonreducing PKSs that are predicted to collaborate in the production of a single polyketide chain for the radicicol core raises interesting questions about the evolution of modularity in PKSs, and on the programming rules that determine b-keto group re-duction, starter unit choice, product chain length, and the folding and cyclization of the nascent polyketide in fungal it-erative PKSs. The functional identification of a regiospecific chlorinase encoded in the radicicol biosynthetic cluster highlights a group of conserved proteins in sequenced fungal genomes that might similarly be involved in sub-strate-and regiospecific halogenation reactions. These fun-gal proteins share conserved active site architecture and a conserved cofactor-binding domain with bacterial flavin-dependent halogenases. Hitherto described only from pro-karyotes, the existence of flavin-dependent halogenases is now documented, to our knowledge, for the first time in the kingdom of fungi. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Strains and Culture Conditions Chaetomium chiversii CS-36-62 (Turbyville et al., 2006) was maintained on po-tato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco). Agar surface culture fermentations were done Figure 5. Model for the Biosynthetic \u2018\u2018Tailoring\u2019\u2019 of Radicicol-type RALs and Biogenetically Related Isocoumarins Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis by growing C. chiversii or its derivatives on PDA plates at 28NoneC for 7 days. Escherichia coli Epi300 and fosmid pCCFOS1 (Epicenter) were used for C. chiversii genomic library construction, and E. coli DH10B and plasmid pJET1 (Fermentas) served for routine cloning and sequencing. Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 (Invitrogen) with the plasmid pAg1-H3 (Zhang et al., 2003) was used for C. chiversii transformation. Cloning, Sequencing, and Sequence Analysis Putative PKS-and halogenase-encoding sequences were amplified by PCR from C. chiversii total DNA as the template, and used to isolate overlapping fosmids from a genomic DNA library as described in Supplemental Data. Over-lapping fragments of None2 kb in size were generated from the selected fosmids by partial HaeIII digests, and cloned into pJET1 to produce double-stranded templates for DNA sequencing. Sequencher 4.7 (Gene Codes) and the Vec-torNTI suite 9.0 (Invitrogen) were used for sequence assembly and analysis. HMM-based gene models were built with FGENESH (Softberry). Additional exon/intron boundary predictions from SPLICEVIEW (http://l25.itba.mi.cnr.it/ Nonewebgene/wwwspliceview.html/) and multiple sequence alignments were also considered for the refinement of the initial gene models. The UMA algo-rithm was used to predict domain boundaries in PKSs (Udwary et al., 2002). The sequences of the radicicol biosynthetic locus (EU980390) and the ccPks01 (EU980392) and ccHmt genes (EU980391) appear in GenBank. Phylogenomic Analysis of Trp Halogenase Superfamily Proteins Twenty-nine deduced proteins annotated as pfam04820 Trp halogenase and five deduced proteins annotated as PRK10015 oxidoreductase were collected from the currently (May 2008) available 34 fungal genome sequences at the Fungal Genome Initiative (FGI) website (http://www.broad.mit.edu/ annotation/fungi/fgi/). Selected bacterial PrnC-type (Hornung et al., 2007) and PrnA-type halogenases (all with the pfam04820 conserved domain) and bacterial PRK10015 oxidoreductases were also included. A multiple sequence alignment of these sequences with the C. chiversii RadH, the putative halogenase-methyltransferase bifunctional protein ccHmt, and the putative P. chlamydosporia Rdc2 radicicol halogenase were generated in VectorNTI. Bootstrapped trees were calculated in CLUSTALX with the neighbor-joining method using 1000 repeats, and the phylogram was plotted with NJPlot (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/njplot.html/). Gene Disruptions in C. chiversii The constructions of the gene disruption vectors for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Zhang et al., 2003) are described in Supplemental Data. Putative transformants were selected on PDA plates supplemented with 350 mg/ml hygromycin and 500 mg/ml carbenicillin (final concentrations) after 5\u20137 days of incubation at 28NoneC. Correct integration of the disruption cassettes at both the 50 and the 30 flanking DNA regions were validated by Southern hy-bridizations using the digoxigenin-labeled (Roche Applied Science) hph gene as the probe. Three ectopic integrant and three homologous replacement iso-lates were evaluated independently for RAL production for each gene knock-out experiment. Extraction and Analysis of RALs Radicicol, monocillin I, and pochonin D were isolated from C. chiversii agar surface fermentations (Turbyville et al., 2006). HPLC analyses and reverse-phase preparative HPLC were done on an HP-1050 equipped with a Kromasil C18 column (5 mm, 250 mm 3 4.6 mm); MeOH:H2O = 60:40 at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min; detection at 220 nm. Accurate mass measurements, 1H NMR, and DQF-COSY spectra for isolated RALs are reported in Supplemental Data.

        "SUMMARY",
        "Fungal polyketides with the resorcylic acid lactone (RAL) scaffold are of interest for growth stimulation, the treatment of cancer, and neurodegenerative dis-eases. The RAL radicicol is a nanomolar inhibitor of the chaperone Hsp90, whose repression leads to a combinatorial blockade of cancer-causing path-ways. Clustered genes for radicicol biosynthesis were identified and functionally characterized from the endophytic fungus Chaetomium chiversii, and compared to recently described RAL biosynthetic gene clusters. Radicicol production is abolished upon targeted inactivation of a putative cluster-spe-cific regulator, or either of the two polyketide syn-thases that are predicted to collectively synthesize the radicicol polyketide core. Genomic evidence supports the existence of flavin-dependent halo-genases in fungi: inactivation of such a putative hal-ogenase from the C. chiversii radicicol locus yields dechloro-radicicol (monocillin I). Inactivation of a cy-tochrome P450 epoxidase furnishes pochonin D, a deepoxy-dihydro radicicol analog.",
        "INTRODUCTION",
        "Fungal polyketides sharing the resorcylic acid lactone (RAL) scaffold display an impressive array of biological activities (Wins-singer and Barluenga, 2007). Zearalenone (4) (Figure 1), isolated from different Fusaria (teleomorph: Gibberella) species, is an es-trogen agonist used for growth promotion in cattle (Winssinger and Barluenga, 2007). Hypothemycin (5) (Figure 1) and similar RALs with a cis-enone moiety are highly specific inhibitors of a subset of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that co-ordinate the responses of the cell to its environment (Winssinger and Barluenga, 2007). Radicicol (1) and its natural analogs, monocillin I (2) and pochonin D (3) (Figure 1), bind to the Ber-gerat-fold ATP-binding pocket of the GHKL superfamily pro-teins, including heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (Roe et al.,",
        "1999). The chaperone Hsp90 is essential for the folding and ac-tivation of a wide range of oncogenic proteins but processes very few housekeeping enzymes. Inhibition of Hsp90 promotes the degradation of the oncogenic clients and leads to the combina-torial blockade of multiple cancer-causing pathways (McDonald et al., 2006). Hsp90 inhibitors also reduce protein aggregation in models of several neurodegenerative diseases (Luo et al., 2007) and increase thermotolerance in plants (McLellan et al., 2007). Radicicol and geldanamycin (Figure 1), a bacterial ansamycin whose derivatives are undergoing clinical trials, are competitive inhibitors binding to the same target (Roe et al., 1999). Radicicol is the most potent inhibitor of Hsp90 in vitro, but the reactivity of its epoxide group, and the sensitivity of its conjugated double bonds to Michael additions, renders it inactive in vivo (Wins-singer and Barluenga, 2007). Intensive synthetic efforts are di-rected at radicicol-like RALs that might overcome this metabolic instability (Dakas et al., 2007; Winssinger and Barluenga, 2007). Fungal polyketides are biosynthesized from malonyl-CoA pre-cursors by polyketide synthases (PKS) that resemble a single module of a bacterial type I PKS (Cox, 2007). Fungal PKSs incor-porate a single ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain for the recursive decarboxylative condensations of the precursors, covalently loaded as acyl thioesters onto the acyl carrier protein (ACP) do-main(s) by a single acyltransferase (AT) domain. Fungal nonre-ducing PKSs (nrPKSs) producing unreduced polyketide chains additionally feature an N-terminal starter unit acyltransferase (SAT) domain (Crawford et al., 2006), a centrally located product templating (PT) domain (Crawford et al., 2008a), and a C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain. Fungal highly reducing PKSs (hrPKSs) producing reduced polyketide chains do not contain SAT, PT, or TE domains but house single catalytic domains with ketoacyl reductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoyl reductase (ER) ac-tivities. Fungal nrPKSs and hrPKSs orchestrate recursive bio-synthetic processes involving the iterative use of their catalytic domains, where the programming rules that determine polyke-tide chain length, reduction (if any) of the b-ketoacyls, and the re-giospecific cyclization of the final polyketide products remain obscure (Cox, 2007). Fungal RALs contain a resorcylate moiety (derived from an unreduced polyketide chain) bridged by a 12-or 14-member macrolactone ring (derived from a reduced polyketide chain).",

        "Chemistry & Biology Radicicol Biosynthesis Whereas most fungal polyketides are biosynthesized by a single PKS, the assembly of RALs requires both an hrPKS and an nrPKS, encoded by clustered genes (Gaffoor and Trail, 2006; Kim et al., 2005; Reeves et al., 2008). Thus, the zearalenone hrPKS (PKS4) was proposed to biosynthesize a reduced hexa-ketide, corresponding to C18\u2013C7. This advanced starter unit is condensed with three additional malonyl-CoA extender units on the cognate nrPKS (PKS13). The formation of the acyl resor-cylate by aldol condensation, and the release of the macrolac-tone by intramolecular ester bond formation, are also carried out by the nrPKS. The results of the recent enzymatic character-ization of PKS13 are congruent with this model, and show that PKS13 is a versatile resorcylic acid macrolactone synthase (Zhou et al., 2008). While this manuscript was in review, a report on the characterization of the hypothemycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Hypomyces subiculosus and the sequencing of a pu-tative radicicol biosynthetic locus from Pochonia chlamydospo-ria has been published, proposing similar biosynthetic models (Reeves et al., 2008).",
        "The presence of a chlorine atom at C6 contributes to the cyto-toxicity of radicicol (1) but has only a small influence on Hsp90 binding (Turbyville et al., 2006). In contrast, the dechloro analog of pochonin D (3) is attenuated in its binding to Hsp90 (Moulin et al., 2005). Although halogenated small-molecule natural prod-ucts are abundant in nature, substrate-and regiospecific halo-genase enzymes have only recently been characterized from various prokaryotic secondary metabolite producers (Neumann et al., 2008; van Pee et al., 2006). Flavin-dependent halogenases that generate hypohalite equivalents are prevalent among these enzymes (Hornung et al., 2007). Although sequence similarities indicated that the putative radicicol biosynthetic locus of P. chla-mydosporia encodes a deduced halogenase (Reeves et al., 2008), no flavin-dependent or any other substrate-and regiospe-cific halogenase enzymes have been functionally characterized from fungi.",

Whereas the recombinant zearalenone nrPKS PKS13 was re-ported to accept short-chain fatty-acid starters from primary metabolism to produce acyl resorcylates in vivo (Zhou et al., 2008), no significant amounts of shunt products were seen to be produced by either C. chiversii RADS knockout strains.",

The deduced RadP shows high similarity to a variety of CYP monooxygenases including EDU51262 from Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (43% identity/62% similarity), and the putative radicicol hydroxylase Rdc4 from P. chlamydosporia (ACD39773, 69% identity/80% similarity). RadP features the conserved Thr (T307) implicated in O2 binding (Buchatskii et al., 2001), as well as the conserved E/DxxR motif (amino acids 359\u2013362) and the conserved FxxGxHxCxGxxxA motif with the invariable Cys (amino acids 437\u2013450, C444), both involved in heme binding. Radicicol features an epoxide moiety at C14(15) that might be expected, in analogy with epothilone biosynthesis (Molna\u0301r et al., 2000), to be installed by a CYP epoxidase acting on a PKS-generated double bond. To establish the role of RadP as radicicol epoxidase, the radP gene was inactivated by di-rected gene knockout. Ectopic integrants, representing more than 99% of the transformants in this case, produced radicicol undisturbed. However, radicicol production was completely abolished in all radP knockout isolates, with the concomitant ap-pearance of a single new RAL with decreased chromatographic mobility (Figure 4D) and a significant red shift compared to radicicol (from 276 to 314 nm). This new RAL was isolated and subjected to FTICR-MS (Figure 4F), 1H NMR, and DQF-COSY spectroscopy (Supplemental Data). Although the limited amount of isolated material precluded us from obtaining 13C NMR spec-tra, the above data revealed this product to be 14(15)-deepoxy-12(13)-dihydro-radicicol, identical to pochonin D (3) previously isolated from P. chlamydosporia (Hellwig et al., 2003). Pochonin D could not be converted to radicicol by feeding the isolated compound to the ccRads1 or ccRads2 knockout strains during fermentations, or during attempts to reconstitute the epoxidation reaction using crude extracts prepared from these strains (Sup-plemental Data).

        "DISCUSSION",
        "The current work describes the functional characterization of the genes for the biosynthesis of radicicol, an Hsp90 inhibitor RAL polyketide, from the endophytic fungus C. chiversii. Clustered genes encoding two PKSs, a halogenase, and a CYP were iden-tified by exploiting the expected similarity of the radicicol biosyn-thetic genes to bacterial flavin-dependent halogenases and the nrPKS and hrPKS genes for the biosynthesis of the RAL zearale-none. Targeted disruptions of the nrPKS, the hrPKS, and a puta-tive transcriptional regulator specifically abolished radicicol bio-synthesis, whereas knockout of the putative halogenase led to the production of the dechloro analog of radicicol (monocillin I). Targeted disruption of the CYP furnished a deepoxy analog that was also devoid of the C12-C13 cis double bond. Disruption of orf3 encoding a putative cystathionine g-synthase/b-lyase led",
        "to no change in radicicol production, establishing the right bor-der of the C. chiversii cluster (data not shown). Attempts to dis-rupt orf1 encoding a putative trehalose-6-phosphate synthetase at the left flank of the cluster were unsuccessful and not pursued further. The putative P. chlamydosporia radicicol biosynthetic cluster whose sequencing coincided with our work (Reeves et al., 2008) contains orthologous genes to the C. chiversii cluster (Table 1) but appears to be scrambled by two inversions (Figure 2A). The C. chiversii cluster-specific regulator, encoded by radR, is missing from the sequenced P. chlamydosporia locus. The radicicol biosynthetic machineries in both fungi must recruit an NAD(P)H-dependent flavin reductase to provide reduced cofactor for the halogenase, and a NADPH-dependent CYP re-ductase to supply electrons to the CYP. Because neither halo-genases nor CYPs require exclusive reductase partners (Molna\u0301r et al., 2005; van Pee et al., 2006), these two functions must be provided by housekeeping enzymes. No significant synteny of the C. chiversii radicicol locus was detected with the completely sequenced C. globosum genome (http://www.broad.mit.edu/ annotation/fungi/fgi/). The overwhelming majority of fungal polyketides are produced by single PKS enzymes with one set of active site domains that are used iteratively in a programmed recursive biosynthetic pro-cess. Remarkably, the biosynthesis of fungal RALs, as shown for zearalenone (Gaffoor and Trail, 2006; Kim et al., 2005), hypothe-mycin (Reeves et al., 2008), and now for radicicol, exploits both an hrPKS and an nrPKS for the biosynthesis of a single continu-ous polyketide chain. With the nrPKS utilizing the product of the hrPKS as a starter unit, the collaborating RAL PKSs represent a conceptual step toward modularity. A close parallel to RAL bio-synthesis is the assembly of norsolorinic acid, where a special-ized fatty-acid synthase (a PKS equivalent) produces a hexa-noate starter extended by an nrPKS (Crawford et al., 2008b). The biosynthesis of T toxin requires two hrPKSs to build a single linear polyketide chain (Baker et al., 2006). In contrast, the two PKS systems for lovastatin, compactin and squalestatin, pro-duce two separate polyketide chains that are conjoined via ester bonds by post-PKS tailoring enzymes (Cox, 2007). The nonaketide backbone of zearalenone and hypothemycin were proposed to be assembled, on the basis of their reduction patterns, through three rounds of nonreductive chain exten-sions on nrPKSs that use a reduced hexaketide starter from their hrPKS partners (Gaffoor and Trail, 2006; Reeves et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008). The structure of radicicol does not al-low for a similarly clear prediction. Thus, it is currently unknown whether CcRADS2 (and the putative Rdc1 from P. chlamydo-sporia) extends a b-keto hexaketide starter unit using three malonyl-CoA building blocks, or elaborates a pentaketide starter unit with four malonyl-CoA extenders (Figure 2B). A cor-relation was previously proposed between the primary se-quences of the SAT domains and their starter unit substrates (Cox, 2007; Crawford et al., 2008b), and separately between the sequences of PT domains and the number of chain exten-sions performed by the nrPKSs (Cox, 2007). The sequences of the SAT domains of the zearalenone, hypothemycin, and the two radicicol nrPKSs are remarkably similar to each other while distinct from known C2 and C6 acceptors (Crawford et al., 2008b). Similarly, the PT domains of these nrPKSs",

However, the limited number of nrPKSs with characterized starter units and product chain length specificities limits the scope of these comparisons and denies insight into the division of labor between the radici-col PKS partners.",
        "Although the first halogenating enzyme (a nonspecific chloro-peroxidase) was isolated from a filamentous fungus, no sub-strate-and regiospecific halogenases were functionally charac-terized previously from any fungal sources (van Pee et al., 2006). The radicicol biosynthetic gene clusters from C. chiversii and P. chlamydosporia each encode a putative enzyme (RadH and Rdc2, respectively) with high similarity to characterized flavin-dependent bacterial halogenases with the pfam04820 (trypto-phan) halogenase conserved domain. The targeted disruption of RadH from C. chiversii leads to the production of the 6-dech-loro analog of radicicol, monocillin I, providing to our knowledge the first functional evidence for a flavin-dependent halogenase in a fungal strain. Bacterial flavin-dependent halogenases form two subfamilies: PrnC-type halogenases acting on phenol and pyrrole moieties, and PrnA-type halogenases processing trypto-phan residues (Neumann et al., 2008; van Pee et al., 2006). A further correlation between the phylogenetic divergence of PrnC-type halogenases and their substrate chemotypes has also been noted (Hornung et al., 2007). A survey of the available 34 fungal genome sequences (http://www.broad.mit.edu/ annotation/fungi/fgi/) revealed 29 uncharacterized conserved proteins with the pfam04820 conserved domain. A phyloge-nomic analysis (Figure S1) indicates an intimate clustering of the deduced fungal pfam04820 proteins with selected bacterial PrnC-and PrnA-type halogenases (Hornung et al., 2007) with multiple clades supported by significant bootstrap values. PrnA-type bacterial halogenases acting on free Trp (Yeh et al., 2005) form the first clade basal to all other sequences, reflecting the low sequence similarity of PrnA-and PrnC-type enzymes (van Pee et al., 2006). The next clade contains selected bacterial and fungal oxidoreductases with the PRK10015 conserved do-main: PRK10015 and pfam04820 proteins belong to the same protein fold superfamily. The small fungal clade I contains pfam04820 enzymes with no functionally characterized mem-bers. Present in the Aspergillus cluster (Eurotiomycetes), Magna-porthe grisea (Sordariomycetes), Botrytis cinerea and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (both Leotiomycetes), these putative enzymes share conserved motifs with, but branch basal to, the bacterial PrnC-type halogenases. The first clade of bacterial PrnC-type halogenases includes proteins similar to the anabaenopeptolide tyrosine halogenase (CAC01605) acting on a carrier protein-bound substrate (Rouhiainen et al., 2000). The bacterial PrnC clade II includes enzymes acting on free pyrrole substrates, as well as chlorinases from the tetracycline and neocarzilin clusters modifying polyketides. The RadH radicicol halogenase (as well as the putative Rdc2 from P. chlamydosporia) belongs to the fun-gal clade II enzymes: these proteins might modify polyketides or other secondary metabolites. The phylogenetic distribution of these putative fungal halogenases is sporadic: they are present in Coprinus cinerea (Homobasidiomycetes), the Aspergillus clus-",
        "ter, and in Chaetomium and Pochonia spp. (Sordariomycetes), but are apparently absent in other Sordariomycetes like the Fusarium cluster. Finally, the bacterial clade III PrnC halogenases tailor carrier protein-bound polyketides and nonribosomal pep-tides or their CoA-bound precursors (Dorrestein et al., 2005). The only biosynthetic step not accounted for by the radicicol clusters is the synthesis of the cis double bond at C12-C13. Although PKSs almost always produce E double bonds, different mechanisms for Z double-bond formation by prokaryotic modu-lar PKS systems have been proposed (Alhamadsheh et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2004). Conceptually, the biosynthesis of cis double bonds by the iterative fungal hrPKSs is even more problematic, because a single set of active sites should yield both geometries. With only a single KR domain, the formation of cis double bonds cannot be dictated by the configuration of the hydroxyl moieties as proposed for separate A-or B-type KR domains in bacteria (Caffrey, 2003). Indeed, the KR sequences from the two radicicol hrPKSs (CcRADS1 and Rdc5) broadly correspond to B-type bacterial KRs present in modules producing E double bonds. However, a polyketide carbon chain rotation during an \u2018\u2018out of register\u2019\u2019 dehydration, as proposed for epothilone biosynthesis (Tang et al., 2004), cannot be excluded. In other prokaryotic systems, Z double-bond formation was proposed to be the result of accessory proteins that modulate the DH activity (Ikeda et al., 1999). Further, a \u2018\u2018tailoring\u2019\u2019 glutathione S-transferase was shown to equilibrate E and Z double bonds in hypothemycin analogs (Reeves et al., 2008). However, no such accessory or tailoring activities are encoded in the radicicol biosynthetic gene clusters. A comparative metabolic analysis leads us to propose a unify-ing scheme for the biosynthesis of RALs and their isocoumarin congeners in C. chiversii, P. chlamydosporia, and Pa. quadrisep-tata (Hellwig et al., 2003; Wijeratne et al., 2006). The hrPKS and the nrPKS collectively produce an ACP-bound 12(13)-dihydro-14(15)-deepoxy nonaketide (Figure 2B). After the resorcylic acid moiety is templated on the nrPKS, TE-catalyzed intramolec-ular ester bond formation yields RALs, or spontaneous or TE-catalyzed hydrolysis releases isocoumarins (Figure 5). The absence of conversion of purified pochonin D and monocillin I by PKS knockout mutants of C. chiversii or their crude protein extracts leaves open the question of whether the ACP-bound re-sorcylate thioesters or the free RALs and isocoumarins serve as substrates for the subsequent tailoring reactions (Dorrestein et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2008). Notably, in vitro reconstitution of the CYP-mediated hydroxylation of hypothemycin was similarly unsuccessful with free substrates, but proceeded in vivo using PKS-generated substrates (Reeves et al., 2008). Either way, the first tailoring reaction is an optional C6 chlorination to yield pochonin D, to our knowledge the first detected natural product from the pochonin-radicicol/chaetochiversin series. Skipping the halogenation step shunts the pathway toward the production of monocillins and paraphaeosphaerins. C14(15) epoxide forma-tion provides the known natural products monocillin III and pochonin A, still without the C12(13) cis double bond. The production of C12 a-hydroxylated natural products by Pa. quad-riseptata (hydroxymonocillin III and paraphaeosphaerin C), and the biosynthesis of pochonin B by P. chlamydosporia suggest a regio-and stereospecific hydroxylation reaction.

        "without the C14(15) epoxide moiety suggests the precedence of epoxidation over C12 hydroxylation. Because C12 corresponds to an a carbon of the relevant polyketide chain extension unit, the C12-OH cannot be derived by the PKS. It is possible, however, that RadP and its equivalents catalyze C12 hydroxylation in ad-dition to C14(15) epoxide formation: a single CYP performing two distinct but specific tailoring steps is known in pikromycin/me-thymycin biosynthesis (Xue et al., 1998). Finally, elimination of water yields the C12(13) Z double bond in the cis RALs monocillin I and radicicol, and in the cis isocoumarins paraphaeosphaerin A and chaetochiversin A. The lack of acidity of the proton at C13 in the C12-OH RALs excludes spontaneous dehydration and sug-gests that this dehydration is catalyzed by an unidentified en-zyme. The natural occurrence of the E isocoumarins para-phaeosphaerin B and chaetochiversin B suggests that these trans isocoumarins derive from a spontaneous cis/trans isomer-ization during fermentations and/or the workup of the extracts.",

The functional identifi-cation of a pair of highly reducing and nonreducing PKSs that are predicted to collaborate in the production of a single polyketide chain for the radicicol core raises interesting questions about the evolution of modularity in PKSs, and on the programming rules that determine b-keto group re-duction, starter unit choice, product chain length, and the folding and cyclization of the nascent polyketide in fungal it-erative PKSs. The functional identification of a regiospecific chlorinase encoded in the radicicol biosynthetic cluster highlights a group of conserved proteins in sequenced fungal genomes that might similarly be involved in sub-strate-and regiospecific halogenation reactions. These fun-gal proteins share conserved active site architecture and a conserved cofactor-binding domain with bacterial flavin-dependent halogenases.

Gene Disruptions in C. chiversii The constructions of the gene disruption vectors for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Zhang et al., 2003) are described in Supplemental Data. Putative transformants were selected on PDA plates supplemented with 350 mg/ml hygromycin and 500 mg/ml carbenicillin (final concentrations) after 5\u20137 days of incubation at 28NoneC. Correct integration of the disruption cassettes at both the 50 and the 30 flanking DNA regions were validated by Southern hy-bridizations using the digoxigenin-labeled (Roche Applied Science) hph gene as the probe. Three ectopic integrant and three homologous replacement iso-lates were evaluated independently for RAL production for each gene knock-out experiment. Extraction and Analysis of RALs Radicicol, monocillin I, and pochonin D were isolated from C. chiversii agar surface fermentations (Turbyville et al., 2006). HPLC analyses and reverse-phase preparative HPLC were done on an HP-1050 equipped with a Kromasil C18 column (5 mm, 250 mm 3 4.6 mm); MeOH:H2O = 60:40 at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min; detection at 220 nm. Accurate mass measurements, 1H NMR, and DQF-COSY spectra for isolated RALs are reported in Supplemental Data. SUPPLEMENTAL DATA Supplemental Data include Supplemental Experimental Procedures, one figure, and Supplemental References and can be found with this article online at http://www.cell.com/chemistry-biology/supplemental/S1074-5521 (08)00408-0/.",
