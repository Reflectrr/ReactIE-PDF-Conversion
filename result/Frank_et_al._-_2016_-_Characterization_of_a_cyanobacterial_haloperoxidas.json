We report the cloning, purification, and characterization of a functional VHPO from the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina (AmVHPO), including its structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Compared to other VHPOs, the AmVHPO features a unique set of disulfide bonds that stabilize the do-decameric assembly of the protein. Easy access by high-yield recombinant expression, as well as resistance towards organic solvents and temperature, together with a distinct halogena-tion reactivity, make this enzyme a promising starting point for the development of biocatalytic transformations. A halogen substituent is often an essential structural feature of natural products, drugs, or signaling molecules and improves their biological properties.[1] Within the large number of over 5000 halogenated compounds described so far,[2] the majority contain bromine or chlorine, whereas iodine and fluorine are rare. Nature has evolved exquisite methods to introduce halo-gen atoms into organic compounds by the use of halogenat-ing enzymes. Among these, the class of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (VHPOs) has attracted increasing attention be-cause of the enzymes\u2019 biocatalytic properties.[3, 4] These include an unusual stability and tolerance to heat and organic sol-vents.[5] An additional advantage is the more flexible substrate scope compared to other halogenating enzymes, such as flavin-dependent halogenases. Some members of the VHPO family, in particular the chloroperoxidases from Actinomycete species, even display high regio-and stereoselectivities in their halogenation reactions.[1c,d,g] VHPOs contain vanadate as a pros-thetic group and catalyze the oxidation of halides (Cl@ , Br@ , or I@)[6] in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Over the course of this reaction, a peroxo intermediate is formed (Figure 1). Unlike the heme-dependent haloperoxidases,[1c, 3d\u2013f] the cofactor here is redox-neutral and thus does not suffer from oxidative inactivation during turnover. A classification according to the most electronegative halide they are able to oxidize differentiates between chloroperoxidases (VCPOs), bro-moperoxidases (VBPOs), and iodoperoxidases (VIPOs). Structural and mechanistic studies of this class of enzymes have been carried out, but there remain unanswered questions regarding the defined substrate binding site or the origin of substrate specificity. The first functional VHPO from a cyanobac-terium was recently identified in the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. CC9311.[7] As this VHPO appears to be part of a cluster of horizontally transferred genes, it was postulated that the epiphytic cyanobacterium might have acquired the enzyme from a red seaweed species or vice versa. In view of the significant catalytic potential observed for VBPOs, we de-cided to focus on a new bacterial member of this family (EC 1.11.X). Our aim was to discover and characterize a prokary-otic alternative to the existing catalysts. In addition to a natural variation in substrate scope and halogenation activities, this may provide a platform for diverse protein engineering efforts and thus an opportunity to establish a new chemoenzymatic halogenation tool in the future. A BLAST search[8] using the characterized enzymes from Cor-allina species as a query identified a designated VBPO from the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017 (AmVHPO) with 47 % sequence identity to both C. pilulifera and C. officinalis and 35 % to Synechococcus sp. CC9311. After in-serting the codon-optimized synthetic gene into a pET28 ex-pression vector, we were able to produce up to 30 mg L@1 of soluble, recombinant protein in an Escherichia coli host system. Following affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, the puri-fied VHPO remained stable and active for several weeks. The enzyme\u2019s dodecameric structure was determined to a resolution of 3.1 a (Rwork/Rfree = 20.7/24.9 %) by X-ray crystallog-raphy, using the Corallina pilulifera VBPO coordinates (PDB ID: 1UP8) for Patterson search calculations[9] (Table 1). Structure analysis with the protein assembly tool PISA[10] calculated a buried surface area of 3340 a2 for each monomer in the 840 kD protein, which was also in line with retention times ob-served during size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 2 A and Figure S14 in the Supporting Information). The tertiary and quarternary structure of AmVHPO is domi-nated by so-called helix bundles (Figure S9). For the algal en-Figure 1. Simplified mechanism of oxidative halogenations catalyzed by zymes, two bundles of neighboring subunits associate closely and jointly contribute to the wider active site spheres. This arrangement has been implicated in multimerization and is found in dimers of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum, as well as in the dodecamers of Corallina species.[11] Although helical bundles are present in other eubacterial haloperoxidases, the AmVHPO is, to the best of our knowledge, the first bacterial enzyme showing this particular type of ar-rangement. A second unexpected feature that stabilizes the monomer, dimer, and, ultimately, the hexamer of dimers, is the presence of intra-and intermolecular disulfide bonds. These occur between Cys206/308 and Cys341 of two neighboring monomers, respectively (Figure 2 c, Figure S10), and are likely to contribute to the enzyme\u2019s significant tolerance to heat and solvents as described below. On a monomeric level, each sub-unit consists of a single, compact a+b type domain with a short N-terminal helix protruding out of the core peptide. Again, this architecture does not resemble any of the bacterial VHPO structures determined to date but is highly similar to the homologous enzymes from red and brown seaweed spe-cies. Structural alignment of AmVHPO with the C. pilulifera, C. officinalis, and A. nodosum VHPOs yields accordingly low root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 0.7, 0.6, and 1.1 a, re-spectively. This strong resemblance in folding and multimeric assembly raises interesting questions about their evolutionary relation-ship. All species share a similar marine environment, and cya-nobacteria are frequently found in symbiotic relationships with algal species.[12] As a result, horizontal gene transfer may have contributed to the distribution of VHPOs, even between differ-ent kingdoms. A closer inspection of the phylogenetic tree (Figure S7) shows separate branches for marine and terrestrial VHPO-producing organisms, which further supports this hy-pothesis. A second possibility is that the cyanobacterial halo-peroxidase genes were acquired by algae through an early process of endocytosis.[13] The latter has been suggested for the evolutionary origin of various plastid types and would account for the observed similarities more convincingly than simple convergent evolution. Although the protein was crystallized in the presence of excess vanadate, an isosteric phosphate obtained from the re-servoir solution replaced the cofactor in the crystal structure. It is bound in a small, defined pocket and protected from solvent by the close assembly of the monomer with its neighboring two subunits. This substructure also forms an access tunnel to Table 1. Crystallographic data processing and refinement parameters for the cofactor and active site cavity (Figure 2 B). Most of the pro-tein\u2019s key catalytic residues involved in cofactor binding and coordination of the peroxo intermediate are conserved in their position and orientation within this class of enzymes (Fig-ure 2 D).[9, 11, 14] Interestingly, if the alignment of the AmVHPO active site is extended to homologous structures of the A. nodosum VBPO and various known VCPOs, small differences become apparent. These include the presence of an additional histidine residue in VBPOs (phenylalanine in VCPOs) and the substitution of a vanadate-coordinating arginine with a trypto-phan, which has been suggested to be involved in halogen specificity (Figures 2 D, S8, and S12).[15] Such comparisons, as well as the substantially higher bromide affinity observed for several VCPOs compared to designated VBPOs (Table 2), hint at a more complex mode of action than suggested by the simple classification into bromo-and chloroperoxidases. The enzyme was subsequently analyzed with respect to its halogenation potential. As recombinant expression yielded the AmVHPO apo form, pre-incubation with K3VO4 was necessary to restore its activity prior to enzymatic assays. Colorimetric assays served as a preliminary qualitative proof for halogenat-ing activity.[3a, 16] Optimal turnover was observed at a pH of 6. The kinetics of VHPOs follow a complex bi\u2013bi ping-pong mech-anism due to sequential reaction with several substrates, such as H2O2 and X @ .[17] When using saturating levels of one of the employed substrates, however, enzyme activities could be sim-plified to pseudo-first order kinetics. As shown in Table 2, the determined kinetic parameters were comparable with those of other VBPOs. In addition to iodination and bromination activi-ties, generally assigned to VBPOs, even the unexpected oxida-tive chlorination was achieved by AmVHPO. It was not surpris-ing that, in the latter case, the detected activity was notably lower than that for the corresponding bromination. Similar findings were described for VBPOs from A. nodosum[18] and C. pilulifera.[19] Because of the high chloride concentration needed to achieve sufficient turnover, the kinetic parameters for chlorination were not determined. In order to confirm that the observed activity indeed stemmed from chlorination and not from bromination, caused, for example, by impurities of the applied KCl or the buffer salts, we conducted ESI MS inves-tigations of the reaction mixture. The chlorinated products 4, 6, and 8 were unequivocally identified (Scheme 1, see the Sup-porting Information for details). Although the specificity con-stant (kcatKM @1) of fungal VCPOs is much higher for bromination than that of our bacterial halogenating enzyme, the intrinsic ability to catalyze chlorination, combined with all of the other versatile properties exhibited by AmVHPO (see below), consti-tutes a valuable starting point for further protein engineering and investigation of the structure\u2013function relationship. Remarkably, AmVHPO is stable for several days in a number of commonly used organic solvents, such as alcohols, acetoni-trile, and acetone, even at concentrations of 75 vol % (Fig-ure S4). In addition, significant thermostability was detected: the activity of the enzyme decreased by 60 % after heating to 65 8C for 30 min, but was fully recovered after cooling to 4 8C. In the dimeric A. nodosum VHPO, disulfide bonds were sug-gested to contribute to the enzyme\u2019s stability.[11e] While the same is likely to apply to AmVHPO, the effect may be en-hanced even further by its dodecameric state. The hexamer of stable dimers increases the percentage of protein interfaces protected from solvent, simply by interactions between neigh-boring monomers (Figure S11). VHPOs are commonly inactivated by high H2O2 concentra-tions, but this limitation is generally circumvented by sequen-tial addition of the oxidant.[20] Initial experiments showed that exposure of AmVHPO to high H2O2 concentrations (100 mm) for 7 h led to a significant decrease in activity (90 %; Figure S5). However, the inactivation appeared to be reversible upon H2O2 consumption. This striking feature became evident, as no sig-nificant difference in the halogenation activity was observed, regardless of whether the oxidant was added slowly or in one addition. As no halogenated natural products have been isolated from A. marina to date,[21] we started our investigation with bromocyclizations of terpenes, as this is the preferred reaction of VHPOs originating from Corallina species.[11f] To our surprise, we observed no conversion for these substrates, either in the presence or absence of organic co-solvents. Halogenation of dicarbonyl compounds such as 1 and activated arenes 3\u201312, however, proceeded smoothly. Further studies of aromatic bro-mination showed that monobrominated products 10 a and 11 a were generated with excellent conversions and regioselec-Table 2. Comparison of Michaelis\u2013Menten constants, turnover numbers, and specific activity. tivities (Scheme 1 B). Optimum results were achieved with equi-molar amounts of KBr and H2O2 at pH 6. [22] The regioisomeric ratios obtained from the bromination of methoxy arenes 5 and 9 closely resemble those achieved by oxidative brominations simply applying NH4VO3 (see the Supporting Information). Nev-ertheless, the biocatalytic method is still preferable to the abio-tic one, as significantly milder conditions are applicable and thus, in principle, a broader substrate range can be addressed. For example, the enzymatic synthesis of 10 a and 11 a pro-ceeds smoothly at pH 6, whereas NH4VO3-mediated halogena-tion requires strongly acidic conditions and is only operative at pH 1. In addition, higher levels of conversion were observed using the enzyme. Interestingly, AmVHPO also worked in a highly chemoselective manner, even allowing differentiation between electron-rich aryl compounds, such as anisole (no conversion) and dimethoxy benzene 9, a task that is hard to accomplish with standard synthetic halogenation procedures. The distinct reactivity displayed by AmVHPO is particularly beneficial when employed in late-stage halogenation, for ex-ample, of a specific, activated aromatic subunit in a structurally complex target compound. Application of our chemoenzymat-ic bromination was likewise possible using the monoterpene thymol (12). Halogenated thymol derivatives possess antibac-terial and antifungal properties, making their synthesis valua-ble for a number of applications in the pharmaceutical indus-try.[23] With AmVHPO as a catalyst, p-bromothymol (13 a) was predominantly formed (88 % yield), with the o-isomer (13 b) being only a minor product. This result is in clear contrast to the conversion obtained by applying the VBPO from A. nodo-sum,[4b] and, in this case, rather resembles the unusual product selectivity of fungal VCPOs.[4a] In summary, the structural and functional characterization of AmVHPO has revealed an unusually robust biocatalyst that is available in high yield using a recombinant E. coli expression system. The structural similarities found between this cyano-bacterial haloperoxidase and its eukaryotic homologues show a fascinating evolutionary relationship between VHPOs from two different kingdoms of life. The enzyme\u2019s successful bromi-nation of aromatic substrates, as well as its ability to chlorinate, point to a promiscuous substrate tolerance combined with se-lective halogenation activities. These properties enable protein engineering and evolution strategies so as to improve this catalyst\u2019s activity, widen its substrate scope, and contribute to more-selective, sustainable, and environmentally benign halo-genations in the future.

        "A halogen substituent is often an essential structural feature of natural products, drugs, or signaling molecules and improves their biological properties.[1] Within the large number of over 5000 halogenated compounds described so far,[2] the majority contain bromine or chlorine, whereas iodine and fluorine are rare. Nature has evolved exquisite methods to introduce halo-gen atoms into organic compounds by the use of halogenat-ing enzymes. Among these, the class of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (VHPOs) has attracted increasing attention be-cause of the enzymes\u2019 biocatalytic properties.[3, 4] These include an unusual stability and tolerance to heat and organic sol-vents.[5] An additional advantage is the more flexible substrate scope compared to other halogenating enzymes, such as flavin-dependent halogenases. Some members of the VHPO family, in particular the chloroperoxidases from Actinomycete species, even display high regio-and stereoselectivities in their halogenation reactions.[1c,d,g] VHPOs contain vanadate as a pros-thetic group and catalyze the oxidation of halides (Cl@ , Br@ , or I@)[6] in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Over the course of this reaction, a peroxo intermediate is formed (Figure 1). Unlike the heme-dependent haloperoxidases,[1c, 3d\u2013f] the cofactor here is redox-neutral and thus does not suffer from oxidative inactivation during turnover. A classification according to the most electronegative halide they are able to oxidize differentiates between chloroperoxidases (VCPOs), bro-moperoxidases (VBPOs), and iodoperoxidases (VIPOs).",
        "Structural and mechanistic studies of this class of enzymes have been carried out, but there remain unanswered questions regarding the defined substrate binding site or the origin of substrate specificity. The first functional VHPO from a cyanobac-terium was recently identified in the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. CC9311.[7] As this VHPO appears to be part of a cluster of horizontally transferred genes, it was postulated that the epiphytic cyanobacterium might have acquired the enzyme from a red seaweed species or vice versa. In view of the significant catalytic potential observed for VBPOs, we de-cided to focus on a new bacterial member of this family (EC 1.11.X). Our aim was to discover and characterize a prokary-otic alternative to the existing catalysts. In addition to a natural variation in substrate scope and halogenation activities, this may provide a platform for diverse protein engineering efforts and thus an opportunity to establish a new chemoenzymatic halogenation tool in the future.",
        "A BLAST search[8] using the characterized enzymes from Cor-allina species as a query identified a designated VBPO from the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017 (AmVHPO) with 47 % sequence identity to both C. pilulifera and C. officinalis and 35 % to Synechococcus sp. CC9311. After in-serting the codon-optimized synthetic gene into a pET28 ex-pression vector, we were able to produce up to 30 mg L@1 of soluble, recombinant protein in an Escherichia coli host system. Following affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, the puri-fied VHPO remained stable and active for several weeks.",
        "The enzyme\u2019s dodecameric structure was determined to a resolution of 3.1 a (Rwork/Rfree = 20.7/24.9 %) by X-ray crystallog-raphy, using the Corallina pilulifera VBPO coordinates (PDB ID: 1UP8) for Patterson search calculations[9] (Table 1). Structure analysis with the protein assembly tool PISA[10] calculated a buried surface area of 3340 a2 for each monomer in the 840 kD protein, which was also in line with retention times ob-served during size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 2 A and Figure S14 in the Supporting Information).",
        "The tertiary and quarternary structure of AmVHPO is domi-nated by so-called helix bundles (Figure S9). For the algal en-",
        "Figure 1. Simplified mechanism of oxidative halogenations catalyzed by",
        "zymes, two bundles of neighboring subunits associate closely and jointly contribute to the wider active site spheres. This arrangement has been implicated in multimerization and is found in dimers of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum, as well as in the dodecamers of Corallina species.[11]",
        "Although helical bundles are present in other eubacterial haloperoxidases, the AmVHPO is, to the best of our knowledge, the first bacterial enzyme showing this particular type of ar-rangement. A second unexpected feature that stabilizes the monomer, dimer, and, ultimately, the hexamer of dimers, is the presence of intra-and intermolecular disulfide bonds. These occur between Cys206/308 and Cys341 of two neighboring monomers, respectively (Figure 2 c, Figure S10), and are likely to contribute to the enzyme\u2019s significant tolerance to heat and solvents as described below. On a monomeric level, each sub-unit consists of a single, compact a+b type domain with a short N-terminal helix protruding out of the core peptide. Again, this architecture does not resemble any of the bacterial VHPO structures determined to date but is highly similar to the homologous enzymes from red and brown seaweed spe-cies. Structural alignment of AmVHPO with the C. pilulifera, C. officinalis, and A. nodosum VHPOs yields accordingly low root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 0.7, 0.6, and 1.1 a, re-spectively.",
        "This strong resemblance in folding and multimeric assembly raises interesting questions about their evolutionary relation-ship. All species share a similar marine environment, and cya-nobacteria are frequently found in symbiotic relationships with algal species.[12] As a result, horizontal gene transfer may have contributed to the distribution of VHPOs, even between differ-ent kingdoms. A closer inspection of the phylogenetic tree (Figure S7) shows separate branches for marine and terrestrial VHPO-producing organisms, which further supports this hy-pothesis. A second possibility is that the cyanobacterial halo-peroxidase genes were acquired by algae through an early process of endocytosis.[13] The latter has been suggested for the evolutionary origin of various plastid types and would account for the observed similarities more convincingly than simple convergent evolution.",
        "Although the protein was crystallized in the presence of excess vanadate, an isosteric phosphate obtained from the re-servoir solution replaced the cofactor in the crystal structure. It is bound in a small, defined pocket and protected from solvent by the close assembly of the monomer with its neighboring two subunits. This substructure also forms an access tunnel to",
        "Table 1. Crystallographic data processing and refinement parameters for",
        "the cofactor and active site cavity (Figure 2 B). Most of the pro-tein\u2019s key catalytic residues involved in cofactor binding and coordination of the peroxo intermediate are conserved in their position and orientation within this class of enzymes (Fig-ure 2 D).[9, 11, 14] Interestingly, if the alignment of the AmVHPO active site is extended to homologous structures of the A. nodosum VBPO and various known VCPOs, small differences become apparent. These include the presence of an additional histidine residue in VBPOs (phenylalanine in VCPOs) and the substitution of a vanadate-coordinating arginine with a trypto-phan, which has been suggested to be involved in halogen specificity (Figures 2 D, S8, and S12).[15] Such comparisons, as well as the substantially higher bromide affinity observed for several VCPOs compared to designated VBPOs (Table 2), hint at a more complex mode of action than suggested by the simple classification into bromo-and chloroperoxidases.",
        "The enzyme was subsequently analyzed with respect to its halogenation potential. As recombinant expression yielded the AmVHPO apo form, pre-incubation with K3VO4 was necessary to restore its activity prior to enzymatic assays. Colorimetric assays served as a preliminary qualitative proof for halogenat-ing activity.[3a, 16] Optimal turnover was observed at a pH of 6. The kinetics of VHPOs follow a complex bi\u2013bi ping-pong mech-anism due to sequential reaction with several substrates, such as H2O2 and X @ .[17] When using saturating levels of one of the employed substrates, however, enzyme activities could be sim-plified to pseudo-first order kinetics. As shown in Table 2, the determined kinetic parameters were comparable with those of other VBPOs. In addition to iodination and bromination activi-ties, generally assigned to VBPOs, even the unexpected oxida-tive chlorination was achieved by AmVHPO. It was not surpris-ing that, in the latter case, the detected activity was notably lower than that for the corresponding bromination. Similar findings were described for VBPOs from A. nodosum[18] and C. pilulifera.[19] Because of the high chloride concentration needed to achieve sufficient turnover, the kinetic parameters for chlorination were not determined. In order to confirm that the observed activity indeed stemmed from chlorination and not from bromination, caused, for example, by impurities of the applied KCl or the buffer salts, we conducted ESI MS inves-tigations of the reaction mixture. The chlorinated products 4, 6, and 8 were unequivocally identified (Scheme 1, see the Sup-porting Information for details). Although the specificity con-stant (kcatKM @1) of fungal VCPOs is much higher for bromination than that of our bacterial halogenating enzyme, the intrinsic ability to catalyze chlorination, combined with all of the other versatile properties exhibited by AmVHPO (see below), consti-tutes a valuable starting point for further protein engineering and investigation of the structure\u2013function relationship.",
        "Remarkably, AmVHPO is stable for several days in a number of commonly used organic solvents, such as alcohols, acetoni-trile, and acetone, even at concentrations of 75 vol % (Fig-ure S4). In addition, significant thermostability was detected: the activity of the enzyme decreased by 60 % after heating to 65 8C for 30 min, but was fully recovered after cooling to 4 8C. In the dimeric A. nodosum VHPO, disulfide bonds were sug-gested to contribute to the enzyme\u2019s stability.[11e] While the same is likely to apply to AmVHPO, the effect may be en-hanced even further by its dodecameric state. The hexamer of stable dimers increases the percentage of protein interfaces protected from solvent, simply by interactions between neigh-boring monomers (Figure S11).",
        "VHPOs are commonly inactivated by high H2O2 concentra-tions, but this limitation is generally circumvented by sequen-tial addition of the oxidant.[20] Initial experiments showed that exposure of AmVHPO to high H2O2 concentrations (100 mm) for 7 h led to a significant decrease in activity (90 %; Figure S5). However, the inactivation appeared to be reversible upon H2O2 consumption. This striking feature became evident, as no sig-nificant difference in the halogenation activity was observed, regardless of whether the oxidant was added slowly or in one addition.",
        "As no halogenated natural products have been isolated from A. marina to date,[21] we started our investigation with bromocyclizations of terpenes, as this is the preferred reaction of VHPOs originating from Corallina species.[11f] To our surprise, we observed no conversion for these substrates, either in the presence or absence of organic co-solvents. Halogenation of dicarbonyl compounds such as 1 and activated arenes 3\u201312, however, proceeded smoothly. Further studies of aromatic bro-mination showed that monobrominated products 10 a and 11 a were generated with excellent conversions and regioselec-",
        "Table 2. Comparison of Michaelis\u2013Menten constants, turnover numbers, and specific activity.",
        "tivities (Scheme 1 B). Optimum results were achieved with equi-molar amounts of KBr and H2O2 at pH 6. [22] The regioisomeric ratios obtained from the bromination of methoxy arenes 5 and 9 closely resemble those achieved by oxidative brominations simply applying NH4VO3 (see the Supporting Information). Nev-ertheless, the biocatalytic method is still preferable to the abio-tic one, as significantly milder conditions are applicable and thus, in principle, a broader substrate range can be addressed. For example, the enzymatic synthesis of 10 a and 11 a pro-ceeds smoothly at pH 6, whereas NH4VO3-mediated halogena-tion requires strongly acidic conditions and is only operative at pH 1. In addition, higher levels of conversion were observed using the enzyme. Interestingly, AmVHPO also worked in a highly chemoselective manner, even allowing differentiation between electron-rich aryl compounds, such as anisole (no conversion) and dimethoxy benzene 9, a task that is hard to accomplish with standard synthetic halogenation procedures.",
        "The distinct reactivity displayed by AmVHPO is particularly beneficial when employed in late-stage halogenation, for ex-ample, of a specific, activated aromatic subunit in a structurally complex target compound. Application of our chemoenzymat-ic bromination was likewise possible using the monoterpene thymol (12). Halogenated thymol derivatives possess antibac-terial and antifungal properties, making their synthesis valua-ble for a number of applications in the pharmaceutical indus-try.[23] With AmVHPO as a catalyst, p-bromothymol (13 a) was predominantly formed (88 % yield), with the o-isomer (13 b) being only a minor product. This result is in clear contrast to the conversion obtained by applying the VBPO from A. nodo-sum,[4b] and, in this case, rather resembles the unusual product selectivity of fungal VCPOs.[4a]",
        "In summary, the structural and functional characterization of AmVHPO has revealed an unusually robust biocatalyst that is available in high yield using a recombinant E. coli expression system. The structural similarities found between this cyano-bacterial haloperoxidase and its eukaryotic homologues show a fascinating evolutionary relationship between VHPOs from two different kingdoms of life. The enzyme\u2019s successful bromi-nation of aromatic substrates, as well as its ability to chlorinate, point to a promiscuous substrate tolerance combined with se-lective halogenation activities. These properties enable protein engineering and evolution strategies so as to improve this catalyst\u2019s activity, widen its substrate scope, and contribute to more-selective, sustainable, and environmentally benign halo-genations in the future.",
