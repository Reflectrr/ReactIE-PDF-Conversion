WalshDepartment of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston,Massachusetts, 02115Abstract The biosynthetic gene cluster for the kutzneride family of hexapeptidolactones includes the four-gene cassette ktzABCD postulated to generate a nonproteinogenic amino acid. Encoded by thiscassette are the nonheme FeII-dependent halogenase KtzD and the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-likeflavoprotein KtzA, proposed to work in conjunction with adenylating protein KtzB and carrier proteinKtzC. In the present work, we report the in vitro reconstitution of this four-protein system and identifythe final product as (1S, 2R)-allocoronamic acid bound in thioester linkage to KtzC. Further analysisof KtzD and KtzA support a biosynthetic pathway that involves KtzD-mediated generation of a \u03b3-chloroisoleucyl intermediate which is cyclized to the final product by KtzA without redoxparticipation of the bound flavin cofactor. This work introduces a new monomer for potentialincorporation into nonribosomal peptides and validates the unique strategy for its biosynthesis.Nonribosomal peptides constitute a diverse class of secondary metabolites with importantbiological activities.1 In addition to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids, nonribosomalpeptide synthetases make use of a large number of modified amino acid and hydroxy acidbuilding blocks.2 Understanding the chemical pathways and mechanisms used in thebiosyntheses of these monomers is a first step towards expanding the pool of new moleculesavailable through metabolic engineering.Towards this end, we recently used halogenase-directed probes to clone the gene cluster3responsible for the biosynthesis of a series of hexadepsipeptides, kutznerides, isolated fromthe soil actinomycete kutzneria4,5 (Figure S1). These molecules contain a number of unusualChristopher_Walsh@hms.harvard.edu. NIH Public AccessAuthor ManuscriptJ Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October 29.Published in final edited form as:J Am Chem Soc. 2008 October 29; 130(43): 14022\u201314023. doi:10.1021/ja8064667.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript monomers whose biosyntheses have not been described. Bioinformatic analysis of the genecluster identified three potential halogenases. KtzQ and KtzR are shown in separate work tobe flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases which can generate the 6,7-dichlorotryptophanresidue postulated in kutzneride biosynthesis.6 KtzD was predicted to be an FeII-dependenthalogenase capable of chlorinating an unactivated carbon center.The four-protein cassette KtzABCD could potentially function to generate a novel amino acidvia a cryptic chlorination pathway. KtzC and KtzB were assigned roles as carrier protein andadenylation protein, respectively. KtzA is a flavoprotein homologous to members of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) family of enzymes. We initially hypothesized that these fourproteins produce the nonproteinogenic amino acid 2-(1-methylcyclopropyl)glycine (MecPG),3,7 a component of all kutzernide molecules reported to date. Herein, we report the biochemicalcharacterization of KtzABCD and demonstrate that they instead function to produce analternative cyclopropyl-containing amino acid, (1S, 2R)-allocoronamic acid (alloCMA),tethered to KtzC. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of alloCMA in a naturalsource. To study the role of the KtzABCD cassette, the individual genes were cloned into E. coliexpression vectors as His-tag fusions. Overexpression and Ni-NTA purification providedsoluble protein for each construct. The carrier protein KtzC was isolated in apo form andphosphopantetheinylated via incubation with coenzyme A and Sfp. KtzA was isolated withFAD bound at 50% occupancy. After initial purification of the halogenase KtzD, the His tagwas proteolytically cleaved and the enzyme purified by gel filtration and reconstitutedanaerobically with FeII and \u03b1-ketoglutarate to obtain the active form of the protein.In accordance with its previously described adenylating activity,3 KtzB efficiently activatesand loads both L-Ile and L-allo-Ile to holo-KtzC as the phosphopantetheinyl thioesters. Theprotein-tethered amino acids can be identified by enzymatic hydrolysis with the Type IIthioesterase TycF8 and conversion to readily detectable isoindole derivatives using establishedprocedures.9 Incubation of L-Ile-S-KtzC with KtzD for 1 hour results in complete consumptionof starting material and production of a new aminoacyl thioester product (Figure 1A). MSanalysis on the released isoindole derivative shows this product results from a singlechlorination event. Treatment of L-allo-Ile-S-KtzC with KtzD does not lead to the formationof a new product (Figure S3), illustrating the substrate specificity of the halogenase.Exposure of the chlorinated intermediate to KtzA again leads to complete conversion to a newproduct. MS analysis shows the released amino acid product to have a m/z ratio consistent withdehydrochlorination of the intermediate and net two-electron oxidation of the startingisoleucine. Supplementing the reaction with excess FAD had no effect on product formation(data not shown). To confirm the structure of the final product, the isoindole derivative waspurified by HPLC and analyzed by 1H-and COSY-NMR. Additionally, 13C6-Ile was used asthe starting material, and the isotope-enriched product analyzed by HMQC and 1H-NMRspectroscopy. The spectral data support the atom connectivity of alloCMA (Figures S7/S8,Table S1).The stereochemistry of the product was deduced from two observations. First, the observedproduct fails to co-elute with an authentic sample of coronamic acid under the typical HPLCconditions (Figure S9). Second, the \u03b3-CH2 protons show 1H-NMR resonances at 1.47 and -0.14ppm. The unusual upfield resonance is best explained by strong shielding of the proton as aresult of its location directly above the aromatic ring of the isoindole group. For this to occuron the rigid cyclopropyl skeleton, the ethyl side chain and isoindole group must be in a cisarrangement. Based on the observed alloCMA structure, we propose a biosynthetic schemeNeumann and WalshPage 2J Am Chem Soc.

Treatmentof Ile-d6-S-KtzC with KtzD produces a chlorinated product that retains all deuterium labels.Identical treatment of Ile-d3-S-KtzC produces a chlorinated product which retains only twodeuterium labels (Figure 2). Additionally, analysis of the reaction at partial conversion showsthat the rate of chlorination of Ile-d3 is retarded relative to Ile and Ile-d6 (Figure S4). Thiskinetic isotope effect for H/D abstraction is consistent with the isotope effect observed instopped flow studies of the related halogenase CytC3.10Cyclization of 2 to alloCMA-S-KtzC is mediated by the ACAD-like flavoprotein KtzA.ACADs catalyze dehydrogenation of acyl/aminoacyl CoA thioesters by abstraction of theacidic \u03b1-proton and transfer of a \u03b2-hydride to the FAD cofactor to yield the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturatedthioester and FADH2.11 In contrast, KtzA need only abstract the alpha proton of 2 to generatea stabilized thioester enolate which can collapse by intramolecular attack at C\u03b3 to form thecyclopropane. Loss of Cl-constitutes the two-electron oxidation of substrate and avoidsformation of the FADH2 oxidation state.12 To verify that KtzA can catalyze reversible \u03b1-protonabstraction as the initial event in cyclization, unlabeled Ile-S-KtzC was incubated with KtzAin the presence of D2O. Recovery of the amino acid and analysis by HPLC and MS showedincorporation of a single deuterium atom (Figures S5/S6). The yield is similar to that foruntreated Ile-S-KtzC indicating that there is no significant loss of amino acid throughhydrolysis of a dehydrogenated intermediate. Attempts to generate apo-KtzA by treatment ofNi-bound protein with 2M KBr and 2M urea gave negligible yields of protein; thus it is possiblethe flavin cofactor is needed to maintain the tertiary structure of KtzA.The rerouting of a carbanion intermediate in a flavoprotein active site to intramolecularelimination rather than two-electron transfer to the FAD coenzyme has previously beenobserved for the flavoprotein D-alanine oxidase when presented with a non-natural substrate.13 In that case, \u03b2-chloroalanine can be partitioned between \u03b1\u03b2-dehydrochlorination todehydroalanine and C\u03b1 oxidation to \u03b2-chloro-iminopyruvate. In KtzA catalysis, the net removalof H\u03b1 and Cl\u03b3 appears to be the physiological reaction. We have previously reported a relatedfour protein pathway in coronamic acid biosynthesis where L-allo-Ile is comparably convertedto (1S,2S)-coronamic acid via the same cryptic \u03b3-chlorination strategy, but in that case thecyclization catalyst is the Zn-dependent enzyme CmaC.9,14 KtzA and CmaC thus representtwo distinct enzymatic strategies for generation of the thioester enolate needed to initiatecyclopropane formation.In conclusion, we have characterized the activities of the KtzABCD proteins and identified thenovel metabolite alloCMA as the protein-tethered product of these enzymes. Deuterium-labeling studies confirm the regioselective chlorination of L-Ile-S-KtzC at the \u03b3-CH3 positionby KtzD and support the unusual role of the flavoprotein KtzA as the catalytic base whichinduces cyclization without redox participation of bound FAD. This cassette provides abiosynthetic route to a novel amino acid monomer that is a stereochemical complement to thepreviously described coronamic acid. At the same time, the results suggest future directionsfor research on kutzneria. Identifying additional nonribosomal peptides which may containalloCMA and locating the gene cassette which provides for MecPG biosynthesis are now keyavenues for metabolomic and genomic approaches.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Neumann and WalshPage 3J Am Chem Soc.
