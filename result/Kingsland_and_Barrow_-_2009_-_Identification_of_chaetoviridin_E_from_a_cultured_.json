Email: rab@anu.edu.au Chaetoviridins E (1) and B (2) are antibiotic active components isolated from the mycelial extract of an elicited laboratory-cultured coprophilous fungus, Chaetomium sp. obtained from the scat of an emu. The structure of chaetoviridin E was determined to be diastereomeric with the known compound chaetoviridin A, whereas a structure revision of chaetoviridins B and D (10) is proposed, reassigning them to be bicyclic lactol-lactones. The structures of chaetoviridins B and E were determined by detailed spectroscopic analysis, while the revision of chaetoviridin D is through analogy. Manuscript received: 18 June 2008. Final version: 29 January 2009. As a consequence of our ongoing studies of secondary metabo-lites associated with cultured fungi, our attention was drawn to a Chaetomium sp. that displayed differential antibiotic activity against a panel of bacterial pathogens. Of particular inter-est to us was the observed activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphy-lococcus aureus (MRSA) in assays conducted on the crude extract. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanolic extract derived from the filtered mycelial mass returned a remarkable diversity of compounds, produced by a variety of biosyn-thetic pathways. The compounds identified were the new fungal metabolite chaetoviridin E (1) along with the known compound chaetoviridin B (2),[1] in addition to the known fungal metabo-lites cochliodinol (3) and xanthoquinodin A1 (4).[2,3] A fifth compound was isolated from the lyophilized broth and identified as the known metabolite (+)-aureonitol (5).[4] Takahashi and coworkers first reported the isolation and identification of four new angular-type azaphilones from the fungus Chaetomium globosum var. flavo-viride in 1990, and subsequently named them chaetoviridins A\u2013D (6\u20139).[1] The absolute stereochemistry of chaetoviridin A (6) was determined as 5-chloro-9-[(2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxobutyl]-6a-(S)-methyl-3-[(S)-3-methyl-1-pentenyl]-6H-furo[2,3-h]-2-benzo-pyran-6,8-(6aH)-dione; however, neither relative nor absolute stereochemistry were ascribed for chaetoviridins B\u2013D. In our study, we found that chaetoviridin E showed a quasi-molecular ion at m/z 433 displaying a distinctive chlorine isotope pattern. High resolution fast atom bombardment (HRFAB)-MS data indicated a molecular formula of C23H25O6Cl, implying 11 degrees of unsaturation. Fourteen resonances were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, integrating for the 25 protons indi-cated by the molecular formula, whereas the 13C NMR spectrum showed the expected 23 resonances implied by the calculated molecular formula (Table 1). Three of the 11 degrees of unsatu-ration were accounted for by carbonyl moieties with intense IR absorptions at 1770, 1685, and 1620 cm-1.A further five degrees of unsaturation were accounted for by the presence of double bonds indicated by 10 olefinic carbon resonances (Table 1). This suggested the existence of three rings. The resonances at 6.08 and 6.60 ppm were identified as a trans-disposed pair of olefinic protons from their chemical shifts and mutual coupling constant of 3J 15.8 Hz. 1H\u20131H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and coupling constants facilitated the elu-cidation of the 3-methyl-1(E)-pentenyl spin system. A second fragment was readily identified employing 1H\u20131H COSY and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectroscopy in association with a strong IR absorption at 3400 cm-1 as 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-oxo-butane. We recognized the presence of a modified sclerotiorin-type, 5-chloro-isochromene-6,8-dione, ring system through our previ-ous work on molecules bearing this structural motif.[5] Based on interpretation of HMBC data, we proposed a chaetoviridin-type molecular structure, which was rapidly confirmed on com-parison of our data with literature.[1] Notably, our NMR data (Table 1) for chaetoviridin E (1) were found to be consistent with those reported for chaetoviridin A (6); however, the opti-cal rotation, while of similar magnitude, was of opposite sign (chaetoviridin E: [\u03b1]D -102 (c 0.11, CHCl3); chaetoviridin A: [\u03b1]D +98 (c 0.05, CHCl3)). The equal magnitude and oppo-site sign of the specific rotations was preliminary evidence that the two compounds may have been enantiomers; however, the circular dichroism (CD) data negated this, suggesting the same (7S) configuration about the C7 stereocentre (None\u03b5409 -0.5) with an overall similarity between the two spectra.[6] Given the congruence of the NMR data between the two compounds and ruling out the possibility of enantiomers, we propose that chaetoviridin E is diastereomeric with chaetoviridin A. As such, it is reasonable to suggest that the difference is in the con-figuration of the remote stereochemistry at C11, suggesting a molecule possessing (4\u2032S,5\u2032R,7S,11R) stereochemistry.

NMR data, (CDCl3) Identification of Chaetoviridin E from a Cultured Microfungus, Chaetomium sp. and Structural Reassignment of Chaetoviridins B and D 271 structure determination of compound (2) and the congruence of these data with those reported for Takahashi\u2019s chaetoviridin B (7),[1] including optical data, [\u03b1]D -104 (c 0.13, CHCl3) for chaetoviridin B and [\u03b1]D -119 (c 0.16, CHCl3) for com-pound (2), we recommend that a structural revision is warranted. Thus we present a revised structure for chaetoviridin B from the \u03b4-hydroxy acid (7) proposed by Takahashi et al.[1] to the tetra-cyclic isochromenone-lactol-lactone (2) as shown. Given this recommended structural revision, it follows that the structure of chaetoviridin D (9) is also in error and therefore revision to reflect the heterocyclic ring system as presented in the revised structure for chaetoviridin D (10) should be applied (Fig. 1). On surveying the literature, we were comforted by the realiza-tion that similar heterocyclic systems had been assigned for the structures of luteusins C (11) and D (12) isolated from the fun-gusTalaromyces luteus[7] and chaetomugilinsA (13), B (14), and C (15) isolated from the fungus Chaetomium globosum.[8] The relative stereochemistry of the tetracyclic fragment of chaetoviridin B (2) could be deduced based on consideration of NOE and coupling data. Reciprocated NOE correlations between the H8 and 7-CH3 resonances were observed, indicat-ing a cis orientation between the tetrahydrofuran (lactol) and isochromenone skeleton. A 3J 9.8 Hz coupling between H8 and H2\u2032 was ambiguous in supporting either a cis or trans orientation of these two protons; however, a trans configuration of the two protons was inferred based on further NOE correlations. Most notably, the previously mentioned reciprocated NOEs between H5\u2032 and H8 could only be achieved by imposing a trans H8/H2\u2032 geometry.Additionally, on irradiation of H5\u2032, further NOEs were observed to 4\u2032-CH3, H6\u2032, and 7-CH3. This requires the \u03b4-lactone ring to adopt a twist-boat conformation, creating a highly con-cave face to the molecule to facilitate the observed NOEs. The lactol hydroxyl group is placed on the \u03b1 surface to create the concave face, thereby allowing a close interspatial relationship to be established between 7-CH3, H8, and H5\u2032. Finally, an appar-ent trans diaxial relationship exists between H4\u2032 and H5\u2032 as judged by the 3J 10.5 Hz coupling between them.The orientation depicted for chaetoviridin B (2) was chosen based on Whal-ley\u2019s assertion that it is the configuration at C7 that dictates the sign of optical rotation,[9] although it is quite apparent that this observation does not hold true in the more stereochemically com-plex isochromene metabolites shown here. Yamada\u2019s structure of chaetomugilin B (14),[8] determined through single-crystal X-ray analysis, supports our assignment of stereochemistry in chaetoviridin B (2). Examination of the data about the lactol-lactone ring system, common to both structures, demonstrates an extremely close match in both 1H and 13C NMR resonances and supports our claim, used in assigning a structure for chaetoviridin E (1), that a remote centre would have little effect on these resonances.[8,10] Despite the fact that chaetomugilin A (13) identified by Yamada and chaetoviridin D identified by Takahashi as 9 and revised here by us as 10 possess the same 2D structure, it is apparent from analysis of the respective NMR data that these compounds must be diastereomeric.Although 1H NMR presents a close match, 13C NMR data demonstrate large discrepan-cies. Additionally, the specific rotations of the two molecules, chaetomugilin A and chaetoviridin D, are not comparable. Both chaetoviridin E and B demonstrated activity against S. aureus and E. faecalis; however, minimum inhibitory con-centrations (MICs) were demonstrated to be greater than 100 \u00b5g mL-1. Of the compounds isolated from the fungus, xanthoquinodin A1 and cochliodinol showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, possessing MICs against the aforemen-tioned bacterial pathogens at >50 but <100 \u00b5g mL-1. In sum-mary, the structure of one new compound, chaetoviridin E (1), and the structural revision of two compounds, chaetoviridins B (2) and D (10), have been determined. Experimental General Experimental Procedures NMR spectra (\u03b4) in ppm were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz (1H) or 125 MHz (13C). All assignments are supported by analysis of 2D NMR spectra (COSY, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), HMBC); IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin\u2013Elmer 1600 Series Fourier-transform (FT)-IR as a thin film on NaCl plates. UV spectra were recorded on a Cary 4G UV-visible spectropho-tometer as a solution in the solvents indicated. ESI-MS spectra were recorded on a Fisons VG Quattro II mass spectrometer, with positive ion detection or a Bruker Apex 3 mass spectrom-eter. High resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS) were recorded on the Bruker Apex 3 mass spec-trometer. HRFAB-MS were recorded on aVG ZAB-SEQ4F mass spectrometer. Circular dichroisms were measured using a Jobin Yvon CD 6 circular dichroism spectrophotometer, while spe-cific rotations were measured on a Perkin\u2013Elmer 241 polarimeter measured at 24\u25e6C in the solvents indicated. Fungus Isolation and Fermentation A 50-mm \u03c6 malt extract agar (MEA) plate was inoculated from thawed glycerol stocks of MINAP-0017, originally isolated from emu scat, and incubated at 26\u25e6C to give a filamentous cul-ture of the fungus. Two 250 mL flasks containing 125 mL of malt extract broth (MEB) were autoclaved and allowed to cool before being inoculated with 2 \u00d7 1 cm2 of solid culture each. These cultures were then maintained in an aerobic environment with mechanical stirring (125 rpm) at 26\u25e6C for 10 days before they were used to seed 1.5 L of MEB in 2 \u00d7 2 L flasks, where they were maintained at 26\u25e6C in an aerobic environment for 27 days with mechanical stirring (125 rpm). After the lag phase and before the idiophase of the ferment, we employed a tech-nique common in our laboratory for the elicitation of secondary metabolite production.[11] On Day 4, lysed cells of S. aureus (0.5 mL L-1 of broth) derived from the autoclaving of a 5 mL suspension of cells grown on a nutrient agar plate (50 mm\u03c6) were added to the growing cultures and the fermentations allowed to proceed for a further 23 days. The mycelia of each flask were mechanically separated from the broth by filtration through a layer of cheese-cloth, while the filtrate was lyophilized. In the absence of elicitation, only compounds 3, 4, and 5 were observed. The mycelia were extracted with EtOH (150 mL) for 24 h before the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to return 0.32 g of a yellow-brown gum that was suspended in distilled water (30 mL) and extracted with petroleum spirit (60\u2013 80\u25e6C, 30 mL), then with CH2Cl2 (30 mL) and EtOAc (30 mL) in succession. Bioassays showed the CH2Cl2 fraction to be most active and it was subsequently concentrated under reduced pres-sure to yield 0.155 g of an orange oil. This was fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography (290 \u00d7 28 mm internal dia-meter (i.d.)), eluting with MeOH. Three distinctive coloured bands were collected. The first was a bright yellow band con-taining chaetoviridins E and B (elution volume 210\u2013260 mL). 272 S. R. Kingsland and R. A.

Revised structures of chaetoviridin B (2) and chaetoviridin D (10). Identification of Chaetoviridin E from a Cultured Microfungus, Chaetomium sp. and Structural Reassignment of Chaetoviridins B and D 273 TLC (silica, 40:60 petroleum spirit/EtOAc) indicated the pres-ence of several compounds including chaetoviridin E (1), Rf 0.5, and chaetoviridin B (2), Rf 0.3. The fraction was concen-trated under reduced pressure and further purified by HPLC (Phenomenex LUNA 5\u00b5 C18(2), 250 \u00d7 10 mm i.d.) eluting with 70% aqueous MeOH increasing to 100% over 40 min. Chaetoviridin E (1) (24.5 mg) eluted at Rt 27.9 min, as a bright yellow compound, whereas chaetoviridin B (2) (6.6 mg), elut-ing at 25.4 min, was obtained as a fluorescent yellow-green pigment. The second distinctive yellow band, (elution volume 320\u2013 380 mL), yielded xanthoquinodin A1 (4), which was concen-trated under reduced pressure to yield a brown solid, 12.9 mg. Cochliodinol (3) was collected as a third distinctive, slow-moving brown band (elution volume 720\u2013770 mL), which returned a purple solid, 7.4 mg, on removal of solvent. The broth lyophilisate was extracted with EtOH/CH2Cl2 (9:1, 200 mL) for 2 h and the suspension subsequently sonicated for 12 min before the insoluble material was separated by vacuum filtration. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the extract suspended in 45 mL of water and the aqueous phase extracted successively with 45 mL each of petroleum spirit, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The CH2Cl2 partition was fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography (290 \u00d7 28 mm i.d.), eluting with MeOH to return an intense yellow band (elution volume 185\u2013200 mL), which was shown to be (+)-aureonitol (5), a yellow powder, 9.8 mg.

The structure of chaetoviridin E was determined to be diastereomeric with the known compound chaetoviridin A, whereas a structure revision of chaetoviridins B and D (10) is proposed, reassigning them to be bicyclic lactol-lactones.

        "As a consequence of our ongoing studies of secondary metabo-lites associated with cultured fungi, our attention was drawn to a Chaetomium sp. that displayed differential antibiotic activity against a panel of bacterial pathogens. Of particular inter-est to us was the observed activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphy-lococcus aureus (MRSA) in assays conducted on the crude extract. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanolic extract derived from the filtered mycelial mass returned a remarkable diversity of compounds, produced by a variety of biosyn-thetic pathways. The compounds identified were the new fungal metabolite chaetoviridin E (1) along with the known compound chaetoviridin B (2),[1] in addition to the known fungal metabo-lites cochliodinol (3) and xanthoquinodin A1 (4).[2,3] A fifth compound was isolated from the lyophilized broth and identified as the known metabolite (+)-aureonitol (5).[4]",
        "Takahashi and coworkers first reported the isolation and identification of four new angular-type azaphilones from the fungus Chaetomium globosum var. flavo-viride in 1990, and subsequently named them chaetoviridins A\u2013D (6\u20139).[1] The absolute stereochemistry of chaetoviridin A (6) was determined as 5-chloro-9-[(2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxobutyl]-6a-(S)-methyl-3-[(S)-3-methyl-1-pentenyl]-6H-furo[2,3-h]-2-benzo-pyran-6,8-(6aH)-dione; however, neither relative nor absolute stereochemistry were ascribed for chaetoviridins B\u2013D.",
        "In our study, we found that chaetoviridin E showed a quasi-molecular ion at m/z 433 displaying a distinctive chlorine isotope pattern. High resolution fast atom bombardment (HRFAB)-MS data indicated a molecular formula of C23H25O6Cl, implying 11 degrees of unsaturation. Fourteen resonances were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, integrating for the 25 protons indi-cated by the molecular formula, whereas the 13C NMR spectrum showed the expected 23 resonances implied by the calculated molecular formula (Table 1). Three of the 11 degrees of unsatu-ration were accounted for by carbonyl moieties with intense IR absorptions at 1770, 1685, and 1620 cm-1.A further five degrees of unsaturation were accounted for by the presence of double bonds indicated by 10 olefinic carbon resonances (Table 1). This suggested the existence of three rings.",
        "The resonances at 6.08 and 6.60 ppm were identified as a trans-disposed pair of olefinic protons from their chemical shifts and mutual coupling constant of 3J 15.8 Hz. 1H\u20131H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and coupling constants facilitated the elu-cidation of the 3-methyl-1(E)-pentenyl spin system. A second fragment was readily identified employing 1H\u20131H COSY and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectroscopy in association with a strong IR absorption at 3400 cm-1 as 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-oxo-butane.",
        "We recognized the presence of a modified sclerotiorin-type, 5-chloro-isochromene-6,8-dione, ring system through our previ-ous work on molecules bearing this structural motif.[5] Based on interpretation of HMBC data, we proposed a chaetoviridin-type molecular structure, which was rapidly confirmed on com-parison of our data with literature.[1] Notably, our NMR data (Table 1) for chaetoviridin E (1) were found to be consistent with those reported for chaetoviridin A (6); however, the opti-cal rotation, while of similar magnitude, was of opposite sign (chaetoviridin E: [\u03b1]D -102 (c 0.11, CHCl3); chaetoviridin A: [\u03b1]D +98 (c 0.05, CHCl3)). The equal magnitude and oppo-site sign of the specific rotations was preliminary evidence that the two compounds may have been enantiomers; however, the circular dichroism (CD) data negated this, suggesting the same (7S) configuration about the C7 stereocentre (None\u03b5409 -0.5) with an overall similarity between the two spectra.[6] Given the congruence of the NMR data between the two compounds and ruling out the possibility of enantiomers, we propose that chaetoviridin E is diastereomeric with chaetoviridin A. As such, it is reasonable to suggest that the difference is in the con-figuration of the remote stereochemistry at C11, suggesting a molecule possessing (4\u2032S,5\u2032R,7S,11R) stereochemistry.

        "structure determination of compound (2) and the congruence of these data with those reported for Takahashi\u2019s chaetoviridin B (7),[1] including optical data, [\u03b1]D -104 (c 0.13, CHCl3) for chaetoviridin B and [\u03b1]D -119 (c 0.16, CHCl3) for com-pound (2), we recommend that a structural revision is warranted. Thus we present a revised structure for chaetoviridin B from the \u03b4-hydroxy acid (7) proposed by Takahashi et al.[1] to the tetra-cyclic isochromenone-lactol-lactone (2) as shown. Given this recommended structural revision, it follows that the structure of chaetoviridin D (9) is also in error and therefore revision to reflect the heterocyclic ring system as presented in the revised structure for chaetoviridin D (10) should be applied (Fig. 1). On surveying the literature, we were comforted by the realiza-tion that similar heterocyclic systems had been assigned for the structures of luteusins C (11) and D (12) isolated from the fun-gusTalaromyces luteus[7] and chaetomugilinsA (13), B (14), and C (15) isolated from the fungus Chaetomium globosum.[8]",
        "The relative stereochemistry of the tetracyclic fragment of chaetoviridin B (2) could be deduced based on consideration of NOE and coupling data. Reciprocated NOE correlations between the H8 and 7-CH3 resonances were observed, indicat-ing a cis orientation between the tetrahydrofuran (lactol) and isochromenone skeleton. A 3J 9.8 Hz coupling between H8 and H2\u2032 was ambiguous in supporting either a cis or trans orientation of these two protons; however, a trans configuration of the two protons was inferred based on further NOE correlations. Most notably, the previously mentioned reciprocated NOEs between H5\u2032 and H8 could only be achieved by imposing a trans H8/H2\u2032 geometry.Additionally, on irradiation of H5\u2032, further NOEs were observed to 4\u2032-CH3, H6\u2032, and 7-CH3. This requires the \u03b4-lactone ring to adopt a twist-boat conformation, creating a highly con-cave face to the molecule to facilitate the observed NOEs. The lactol hydroxyl group is placed on the \u03b1 surface to create the concave face, thereby allowing a close interspatial relationship to be established between 7-CH3, H8, and H5\u2032. Finally, an appar-ent trans diaxial relationship exists between H4\u2032 and H5\u2032 as judged by the 3J 10.5 Hz coupling between them.The orientation depicted for chaetoviridin B (2) was chosen based on Whal-ley\u2019s assertion that it is the configuration at C7 that dictates the sign of optical rotation,[9] although it is quite apparent that this observation does not hold true in the more stereochemically com-plex isochromene metabolites shown here. Yamada\u2019s structure of chaetomugilin B (14),[8] determined through single-crystal X-ray analysis, supports our assignment of stereochemistry in chaetoviridin B (2). Examination of the data about the lactol-lactone ring system, common to both structures, demonstrates an extremely close match in both 1H and 13C NMR resonances and supports our claim, used in assigning a structure for chaetoviridin E (1), that a remote centre would have little effect on these resonances.[8,10]",
        "Despite the fact that chaetomugilin A (13) identified by Yamada and chaetoviridin D identified by Takahashi as 9 and revised here by us as 10 possess the same 2D structure, it is apparent from analysis of the respective NMR data that these compounds must be diastereomeric.Although 1H NMR presents a close match, 13C NMR data demonstrate large discrepan-cies. Additionally, the specific rotations of the two molecules, chaetomugilin A and chaetoviridin D, are not comparable.",
        "Both chaetoviridin E and B demonstrated activity against S. aureus and E. faecalis; however, minimum inhibitory con-centrations (MICs) were demonstrated to be greater than 100 \u00b5g mL-1. Of the compounds isolated from the fungus, xanthoquinodin A1 and cochliodinol showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, possessing MICs against the aforemen-tioned bacterial pathogens at >50 but <100 \u00b5g mL-1. In sum-mary, the structure of one new compound, chaetoviridin E (1), and the structural revision of two compounds, chaetoviridins B (2) and D (10), have been determined.",
        "Experimental General Experimental Procedures NMR spectra (\u03b4) in ppm were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz (1H) or 125 MHz (13C). All assignments are supported by analysis of 2D NMR spectra (COSY, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), HMBC); IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin\u2013Elmer 1600 Series Fourier-transform (FT)-IR as a thin film on NaCl plates. UV spectra were recorded on a Cary 4G UV-visible spectropho-tometer as a solution in the solvents indicated. ESI-MS spectra were recorded on a Fisons VG Quattro II mass spectrometer, with positive ion detection or a Bruker Apex 3 mass spectrom-eter. High resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS) were recorded on the Bruker Apex 3 mass spec-trometer. HRFAB-MS were recorded on aVG ZAB-SEQ4F mass spectrometer. Circular dichroisms were measured using a Jobin Yvon CD 6 circular dichroism spectrophotometer, while spe-cific rotations were measured on a Perkin\u2013Elmer 241 polarimeter measured at 24\u25e6C in the solvents indicated.",
        "Fungus Isolation and Fermentation A 50-mm \u03c6 malt extract agar (MEA) plate was inoculated from thawed glycerol stocks of MINAP-0017, originally isolated from emu scat, and incubated at 26\u25e6C to give a filamentous cul-ture of the fungus. Two 250 mL flasks containing 125 mL of malt extract broth (MEB) were autoclaved and allowed to cool before being inoculated with 2 \u00d7 1 cm2 of solid culture each. These cultures were then maintained in an aerobic environment with mechanical stirring (125 rpm) at 26\u25e6C for 10 days before they were used to seed 1.5 L of MEB in 2 \u00d7 2 L flasks, where they were maintained at 26\u25e6C in an aerobic environment for 27 days with mechanical stirring (125 rpm). After the lag phase and before the idiophase of the ferment, we employed a tech-nique common in our laboratory for the elicitation of secondary metabolite production.[11] On Day 4, lysed cells of S. aureus (0.5 mL L-1 of broth) derived from the autoclaving of a 5 mL suspension of cells grown on a nutrient agar plate (50 mm\u03c6) were added to the growing cultures and the fermentations allowed to proceed for a further 23 days. The mycelia of each flask were mechanically separated from the broth by filtration through a layer of cheese-cloth, while the filtrate was lyophilized. In the absence of elicitation, only compounds 3, 4, and 5 were observed.",
        "The mycelia were extracted with EtOH (150 mL) for 24 h before the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to return 0.32 g of a yellow-brown gum that was suspended in distilled water (30 mL) and extracted with petroleum spirit (60\u2013 80\u25e6C, 30 mL), then with CH2Cl2 (30 mL) and EtOAc (30 mL) in succession. Bioassays showed the CH2Cl2 fraction to be most active and it was subsequently concentrated under reduced pres-sure to yield 0.155 g of an orange oil. This was fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography (290 \u00d7 28 mm internal dia-meter (i.d.)), eluting with MeOH. Three distinctive coloured bands were collected. The first was a bright yellow band con-taining chaetoviridins E and B (elution volume 210\u2013260 mL).",
