The introduction of a halogen into a molecule can be used to modulate bioactivity, bioavailability and metabolic stability1\u20133. Traditional chemical methods of halogenating aromatic substrates generally employ highly reactive reagents and generate harmful waste. As traditional reagents lack components that enable the tuning of product selectivity, they often generate products in which either only the most nucleophilic positions are halogenated or mixtures of products are produced. Conversely, biosynthetic (enzymatic) halogenation is mild, highly selective and uses simple salts such as NaCl or NH4Br as a halide source whereas oxygen serves as the oxidant1\u20133. Consequently, the discovery and structural characterization of flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs) that are capable of selectively forming C\u2013Cl and C\u2013Br bonds4,5 and the dis-covery of an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent fluorinase6 that is able to mediate nucleophilic C\u2013F bond formation attracted consid-erable attention. A FDH that is capable of generating C\u2013I bonds was not discovered and characterized until recently7.The FDHs that have previously been studied are predominantly drawn from a limited number of well-known phyla2,3,7,8. It may be seen through branching analysis of protein sequences that a correla-tion exists between the protein sequence and substrate preference. Such preference includes the presentation of the substrate; that is, whether or not it is covalently tethered to an associated enzyme (Fig. 1). Almost all previously discovered FDHs have been deter-mined due to their role in the generation of halogenated natural products2\u20139. Many of these metabolites arise from well-studied bac-teria (especially actinomycetes) or fungi. As halogenases only from a very limited series of organisms have been explored so far, their natural substrate specificity has been limited. Considerable effort has been invested into the rational redesign and directed evolution of these enzymes to expand or change the substrate specificity10\u201314.Results and discussionBioinformatics-based discovery of VirX1. We adopted a bioin-formatics-based approach to break from this trend in halometab-olite-led identification of enzymes. Having compiled data from all fully biochemically and structurally characterized FDH enzymes, sequence alignment enabled us to see both of the known GxGxxG and WxWxIP motifs4, as well as a previously unnoticed Fx.Px.Sx.G motif (where \u2018x\u2019 is any amino acid and each \u2018.\u2019 independently repre-sents the number of x between each conserved residue and can be any number: 0, 1, 2 and so on)15. Although GxGxxG and WxWxIP motifs have hitherto been used to indicate the presence of FDHs, GxGxxG could as readily indicate flavin-monooxygenase-related enzymes and the WxWxIP motif is known to be absent in more unusual FDHs such as Bmp516. The Fx.Px.Sx.G motif may be used by itself to mine for halogenases from uncurated genome sequences15.Using our motif as a probe, we revealed the presence of an open reading frame\u2014deposited as \u2018hypothetical protein CPUG_00131\u2019\u2014in the cyanophage Syn10, a broad host range cyanophage with a 177 kbp genome that is known to infect Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus17; we named the encoded protein VirX1. Aligned against known halogenases, VirX1 shows low similarity to the well-studied tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA and RebH (29% and 31% respectively). It may therefore be classified as being in the twilight zone of sequence similarity18. Generation of a homology structural model of VirX1 using Phyre219 and comparative analysis of this to PrnA and all other structurally characterized halogenases revealed a pyramid-and-box-shape structure that is characteristic of tryp-tophan halogenases4. However, the model of VirX1 indicated the A marine viral halogenase that iodinates diverse substratesDanai S. Gkotsi1,2, Hannes Ludewig1,2,9, Sunil V. Sharma1,2,9, Jack A.

Goss\u200a\u200a1,2* Oceanic cyanobacteria are the most abundant oxygen-generating phototrophs on our planet and are therefore important to life. These organisms are infected by viruses called cyanophages, which have recently shown to encode metabolic genes that modulate host photosynthesis, phosphorus cycling and nucleotide metabolism. Herein we report the characterization of a wild-type flavin-dependent viral halogenase (VirX1) from a cyanophage. Notably, halogenases have been previously associated with secondary metabolism, tailoring natural products. Exploration of this viral halogenase reveals it capable of regioselective halo-genation of a diverse range of substrates with a preference for forming aryl iodide species; this has potential implications for the metabolism of the infected host. Until recently, a flavin-dependent halogenase that is capable of iodination in\u00a0vitro had not been reported. VirX1 is interesting from a biocatalytic perspective as it shows strikingly broad substrate flexibility and a clear preference for iodination, as illustrated by kinetic analysis. These factors together render it an attractive tool for synthesis.NATURe CHeMiSTRY | VOL 11 | DECEMBER 2019 | 1091\u20131097 | www.nature.com/naturechemistry1091 Articles Nature Chemistrypresence of a higher number of loops in the C-terminal domain of VirX1, potentially enabling larger conformational changes follow-ing substrate binding and enhanced substrate specificity compared with typical tryptophan halogenases. The active site could be iden-tified from the position of the Fx.Px.Sx.G motif as well as the co-factor binding site GxGxxG.Iodination activity, substrate scope and kinetics of VirX1. We set out to explore whether the encoded protein was indeed an active halogenase and, if so, whether it might show useful biocatalytic utility, including substrate flexibility. To this end, we screened the halogenase against a 400-member library containing substrates that would sterically and electronically challenge the potential catalyst, using liquid chromatography\u2013high resolution mass spectrom-etry (LC\u2013HRMS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) to validate the generation of new halogenated products. Under the conditions of our assay, the enzyme showed very poor activity in chlorinating substrates, but good bromination activity and a surprising preference for iodination. The wild-type enzyme demonstrated striking substrate flexibility (Fig. 2). From this 400-member library, it was determined that 32 sterically and elec-tronically diverse compounds could be accepted as substrates with 1\u201395% conversion (Fig. 2). For each substrate that was processed, LC\u2013HRMS analysis indicated that biotransformative halogenation only resulted in the formation of a monoiodinated product. For the majority of substrates, only a single regioisomer was observed. Enzymatic halogenation could be seen to be mediated on several less reactive or challenging substrates (including (poly)heterocycles (5)20, azaspirocycles (14)21 or bathophenanthroline (30)) that were not readily iodinated using synthetic conditions at room tempera-ture. Fourteen of these products were selected on the basis of both structural interest and conversion level for further analysis, includ-ing spectroscopic structural characterization. This analysis revealed that although halogenation was often mediated at the most chemi-cally reactive position, this was not always the case; for example, enzymatic products 3, 5, 7, 8, 12 and 14 did not match with syn-thetic iodostandards that were prepared by electrophilic iodination, indicating the possibility of different regioisomers being formed (Fig. 2). Steady-state kinetic analysis of the enzyme-catalysed reac-tion was carried out for twelve of these substrates (Table 1).Kinetic analysis revealed the enzyme to have preference for iodide over bromide (Table 1). This is unprecedented as there has been no previous characterization of FDHs with a clear natural pref-erence for iodination in\u00a0vitro. Previous reports exploring whether RebH might mediate iodination revealed through halide competi-tion assays that the introduction of NaI prevented the formation of any chlorinated product, yet no iodinated product was observed22. Conversely, in the competition assays that we explored with VirX1 using equivalent concentrations of NaI, NaBr and NaCl, only the iodinated product could be detected (Supplementary Fig. 17). Under the conditions of our assay, and with all substrates explored, the preference for the halide shown by VirX1 is I > Br > Cl, which corresponds to the decreasing oxidative potential of the halide.PltM halogenase7 has recently been reported to be flexible in terms of halide versatility, permissibly enabling iodination of phe-nolic substrates. Spectroscopic characterization of the iodinated compounds produced by PltM was not reported (possibly due to the notorious instability of iodinated compounds precluding isolation) nor were any kinetics reported for the reaction as the enzyme was seen to precipitate in the presence of NaI, indicating poor tolerance to this halide19. This versatility of halide utilization observed for PltM\u2014in which iodination is permissible\u2014is perhaps more exten-sive. In this study, we showed that although PrnA could not iodin-ate its natural substrate tryptophan, discernible levels of iodination were evident with a number of its unnatural substrates, though typically at ~1% conversion (Supplementary Table 6). We explored whether PrnA might also mediate halogenation of substrates that are processed by VirX1. We saw that PrnA could process many of the substrates to a low level. It may be that many of the FDHs\u2014in addition to PrnA and PltM\u2014could be capable of very limited or trace iodination in the presence of certain substrates.VirX1, however, shows very clear iodination activity. Specifically, iodination by VirX1 of a modest/non-native substrate 6-azaindole (1) proceeds with a kcat of 5 min-1 (kcat/Km of 0.18 min-1 \u00b5M-1) whereas PrnA\u2019s chlorination of its natural substrate progresses more slowly with a kcat of 0.093 min-1 (kcat/Km of 0.0006 min-1 \u00b5M-1)4. Synthetic halogenation of 6-azaindole (1) with free hypohalous acid, at a low concentration in phosphate buffer, unsurprisingly results in the VirX1 viral FDHNon-FDH flavoenzymes (outgroup)Tryptophan FDHsSingle-component non-FDH flavoenzymes (outgroup) Single-component FDHTethered pyrrole/phenolFree pyrrole/phenolVirX1 PyrH KtzR Bmp5 FMO DM AM BV MO CH ex MPr nC H al BP ltMP ltAH rm Q H al YAclH A oiQRdc2 Arm H 1TiaM VhaA BhaA Stal Tcp21 CndH Clohal ChIA Bmp2 MIC AL KM O_ HS KM O_ Pf PH BH St yA V A O W 2M H pa B K rm l MibH B rvH Thal R ebH KtzQ PrnA SttH Th-Hal Fig. 1 | A protein-based branching analysis of VirX1 against known FDHs and other non-FDH flavoenzymes that reveals the functional relationship, known substrate utilization and branching order between protein clusters. The viral iodinase VirX1 (highlighted in purple alongside the arrow) is predicted to branch away from the tryptophan chlorinases and brominases while still being associated with their cluster. The analysis highlights the evolved differences in the halide preference and correspondingly grouped substrate preferences of these FDHs. The diagram is represented as an unrooted circular phylogram in which nodes (shown as coloured circles) represent each individual amino acid sequence analysed, and the branches (the lines connecting them) represent the degree of evolutionary divergence (for example, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions that have occurred between connected branch points). A global alignment of the full-length amino acid sequences of VirX1 with other known FDHs and non-FDH flavoenzymes (used as an outgroup) was used to construct the branching diagram (through application of the neighbour-joining method), applying the Kimura algorithm for protein distance measurements. Bootstrapping analysis was performed in 100 replicates.NATURe CHeMiSTRY | VOL 11 | DECEMBER 2019 | 1091\u20131097 | ArticlesNature Chemistrygeneration of a diiodinated product (with HOI) and a series of other products; for example, in reaction with HOBr, a dimer of bromo-6-azaindole was observed by LCMS (Supplementary Scheme 1). Conversely the VirX1 catalysed reaction yields only the monoiodin-ated or monobrominated product as a single regioisomer.The structure of VirX1. We next sought to structurally investigate VirX1. Purification of the protein enabled X-ray crystallographic analysis of the apo structure that revealed six monomers of VirX1 in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 3a), all of which showed the highest structural similarity to the PrnA E450K structure (Dali search; highest Z-score = 47.1; PDB ID: 4Z43) that shares the box and pyramid architecture in agreement with our bioinformatics predic-tions4,23. The six monomers in the asymmetric unit are predicted by jsPISA 2.0.5 (ref. 24) to form two stable trimeric assemblies (Fig. 3b; \u0394Gdiss = ~42.6 kcal mol-1, where \u0394Gdiss is the Gibbs energy of dissociation) with protein\u2013protein interfaces that cover an area of 10,486.4 \u00c52 per trimer (Fig. 3). The trimeric state of VirX1 was confirmed by analytical size exclusion chromatography, revealing an apparent molecular weight of VirX1 of around 180 kDa in solu-tion, as well as by size-excluion chromatography multiangle light scattering (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 4) NH2 N OH 26 (15%)N H N 23 (35%)O O OMe OMe 31 (20%)24 (10%)N OH SMe 25 (20%)N O O O 18 (10%)N H NH2 19 (50%)HO O 15 (20%)N H N OMeO 16 (35%)N N O Me 17 (30%)N N 29 (>1%)O O O HO OH 30 (>1%)H N H2N 27 (15%)MeO N O 28 (>1%)NHMe 20 (70%)N N H N 22 (15%)21 (>1%)HO OH O O 32 (5%)NHO HO HN 4 (65%)N O 5 (30%)N O 14 (15%)N NH2N 2 (30%)O N H2N 9 (30%)N HO 10 (70%)N H2N 11 (20%)N NH2 N N HO 13 (10%)12 (15%)N OH 6 (65%)N N H 1 (95%)O N OH 3 (>5%)O NH2 NH2 7 (25%)N N H2N 8 (20%)I I I I I I I I I * I * I * I * I I * * Fig. 2 | The diverse substrate scope of VirX1. Biocatalytic halogenation using VirX1 on a 400-member compound library revealed 32 compounds that were accepted as substrates. The enzyme is shown to monohalogenate a diverse range of sterically and electronically different substrates. Fourteen substrates (boxed) were selected on the basis of both interest in the product and their stability for further verification by either scale-up and spectroscopic characterization of their product or by comparison to synthetic standards that we generated and fully characterized. Iodinated products 1 and 2 were isolated from VirX1 biotransformations, whereas the regiochemistries for 3\u201314 were determined by comparison with synthetic standards. The asterisks denote hypothesized halogenation sites by VirX1 where the enzymatic product did not match with synthetic standards. Conversion levels to the iodinated product are reported, as estimated by LC-HRMS or UPLC analysis.NATURe CHeMiSTRY | VOL 11 | DECEMBER 2019 | 1091\u20131097 | www.nature.com/naturechemistry1093 Articles Nature Chemistryand analytical ultracentrifugation (Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Table 5). The trimer forms a bowl-shaped assembly, with one substrate binding site per monomer that flanks the insides of the bowl (Fig. 3c,d).The structure of VirX1 shows many similarities to other FDHs with the box-shaped flavin binding module (required for flavin binding and generation of the hypohalous acid electrophile) being almost identically folded (Fig. 4a). Both K79 and E358, implicated in haloamine formation and in deprotonation of the Wheland inter-mediate, respectively, occupy similar positions to K79 and E346 in the active site of PrnA (Fig. 4b). The positionings of F99 and Y97 are similar to those seen for F103 and H101 in PrnA complexing the tryptophan (Trp), Cl and FAD (PDB ID: 2AQJ) ligands, which are believed to stabilize the Wheland intermediate4. Assay with mono-chlorodimedone4 indicated that the halogenating species must be enzyme bound (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to identify key catalytic residues, and although the mutants K79A, K79R, F353A, S359A and P356A all yielded soluble proteins (that eluted in a very similar manner to wild-type VirX1, suggesting correct folding of these mutants), each of these mutants were determined to be completely inactive in cata-lysing halogenation of 6-azaindole (1) with either NaI or NaBr, rein-forcing the importance of these residues for the enzyme\u2019s catalytic activity (Supplementary Fig. 16).As anticipated, with all key catalytic residues in place, the \u03b1-helical pyramid-shaped substrate module displays a different arrangement of secondary structure elements to its closest structural homologue PrnA (Fig. 4a). Key differences include the absence of the \u03b1-helical lid that is required for tryptophan halogenases (T435-W455 in PrnA) to close off the tryptophan binding site (as seen in BrvH)25 (Fig. 4c). The substrate binding site of VirX1 displays an even wider opening than BrvH, providing a possible explanation for the wide substrate scope, and the ability to accommodate a halide with a larger van\u00a0der Waals radius (Fig. 4c). Further expansion of the puta-tive substrate binding site is enabled by the increased distance of \u03b117 and \u03b118 from the catalytic residues in it. A further key difference to PrnA, RebH and BrvH is an additional loop (P432-Q442) taking part in the trimer interface through a hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 3b), opening up access to the substrate binding site (Fig. 4).To further explore the VirX1 substrate binding mode, many attempts were made to crystallize VirX1 in complex with various substrates. However, these did not yield sufficiently diffracting crystals for structural analysis, therefore in silico methods were explored instead. Given the subjectivity of in silico small-molecule protein docking experiments, several complementary approaches were explored with both rigid and flexible models of VirX1. Compounds 1\u201314 were docked within a 47.25 \u00d7 47.25 \u00d7 47.25 \u00c5 (105,488 \u00c53) search space centered on rigid VirX1 (chain a), which identified a substrate binding cleft in similar position to other FDHs that harbour K79 and E358. These results informed further docking experiments restricted to this cleft, conducted with rigid and flexible amino acid residues. The flexible docking experi-ments yielded conformations with a decreased binding energy (~5 kcal mol-1) for all substrates compared with docking into the rigid VirX1 pocket (Supplementary Table 2). The choice of hypo-thetical binding modes (Supplementary Figs. 1\u201311) was mainly informed by proximity of the putatively halogenated carbon to K79 that would form and position the iodamine for reaction with the substrate and E358, which would stabilize the Wheland inter-mediate. Through this analysis, three residues were identified to be involved in substrate binding across all docked substrates: Y97, P98 and F99, with the two aromatic resides often seen to be sand-wiching the substrate (Supplementary Figs. 1\u201312). Other residues such as L53, I82 and G100 were also frequently implicated in bind-ing the docked compounds, with the predicted binding mainly comprising hydrophobic contacts (Supplementary Figs. 1\u201312). The docking experiments support binding in a cleft with access to K79 and E358, similarly to characterized complex structures of FDH-substrate complexes4. Several further residues implicated in binding reinforced the extensive active site cavity that enable the strikingly broad substrate flexibility (Supplementary Fig. 12). It is likely that oxidation potential dictates the preference for halide utilization (as indicated by I > Br > Cl) and that it is this enlarged cavity that enables halogenation through a bulky iodamine species. Conclusions Our results reveal catalytically notable regioselective halogenations by an FDH, with a viral-derived enzyme demonstrating a prefer-ence for iodination. Notably, we also show that by extending the substrate scope of PrnA, iodination in this system may also be permissible. We demonstrate that VirX1 possesses a very broad substrate flexibility and is able to process sterically and electroni-cally demanding substrates in addition to series of nitrogen and Table 1 | Kinetic parameters for iodination and bromination reactions that are catalysed by VirX1 with selected substratesCompound Nai NaBr kcat (min-1)Km (\u03bc\u039c)kcat/Km (min-1\u2009\u03bc\u039c)kcat (min-1)Km (\u03bc\u039c)kcat/Km (min-1\u2009\u03bc\u039c)1 5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 28\u2009\u00b1\u20092 0.179\u2009\u00b1\u20090.004 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 53\u2009\u00b1\u20093 0.044\u2009\u00b1\u20090.008 2 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 145\u2009\u00b1\u20099 0.021\u2009\u00b1\u20090.004 1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 201\u2009\u00b1\u20096 0.004\u2009\u00b1\u20090.001 3 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 190\u2009\u00b1\u20096 0.006\u2009\u00b1\u20090.001 N.D.

This may be attributed to the relatively large and accessible active site that was revealed by the crystal structure, and the high level of conformational flexibility predicted by our modelling studies. We reveal a system that may be used as a bio-catalytic tool that enables enzyme-catalysed iodination, selective C\u2013H activation and the generation of highly reactive species that could be used for further functionalization. It is envisioned to be a potentially very powerful tool for enabling modification of natural products in the presence of the living host organism through a liv-ing GenoChemetics approach26.The role that marine viruses play in manipulating the metabolism of the cyanobacteria they infect has recently been postulated27, and the discovery of an efficient viral halogenase with broad substrate flexibility is therefore interesting. Halogenation of a molecule can subtantially perturb its bioactivity and bioavailability, and iodin-ation can render a molecule highly chemically reactive. Although the levels of iodide in the oceans are very low compared to those for bromide and chloride (0.05 ppm versus 65 ppm and 18,980 ppm, respectively), marine algae and bacteria have been shown to accu-mulate and use iodide28,29. The naturally broad substrate specificity of this enzyme\u2014encoded in a virus that naturally infects the two most abundant photosynthetic organisms on the planet\u2014is fasci-nating and leads one to wonder as to what its natural role might be. We are taking steps to explore the impact of this iodinase on cyanobacterial metabolism.Data availabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available in this Article and its Supplementary Information, or are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

        "rjmg@st-andrews.ac.ukThe selective formation of carbon\u2013halogen (C\u2013X) bonds is of great importance to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries1,2. The introduction of a halogen into a molecule can be used to modulate bioactivity, bioavailability and metabolic stability1\u20133. Traditional chemical methods of halogenating aromatic substrates generally employ highly reactive reagents and generate harmful waste. As traditional reagents lack components that enable the tuning of product selectivity, they often generate products in which either only the most nucleophilic positions are halogenated or mixtures of products are produced. Conversely, biosynthetic (enzymatic) halogenation is mild, highly selective and uses simple salts such as NaCl or NH4Br as a halide source whereas oxygen serves as the oxidant1\u20133. Consequently, the discovery and structural characterization of flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs) that are capable of selectively forming C\u2013Cl and C\u2013Br bonds4,5 and the dis-covery of an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent fluorinase6 that is able to mediate nucleophilic C\u2013F bond formation attracted consid-erable attention. A FDH that is capable of generating C\u2013I bonds was not discovered and characterized until",
        "recently7.The FDHs that have previously been studied are predominantly drawn from a limited number of well-known phyla2,3,7,8. It may be seen through branching analysis of protein sequences that a correla-tion exists between the protein sequence and substrate preference. Such preference includes the presentation of the substrate; that is, whether or not it is covalently tethered to an associated enzyme (Fig. 1). Almost all previously discovered FDHs have been deter-mined due to their role in the generation of halogenated natural products2\u20139. Many of these metabolites arise from well-studied bac-teria (especially actinomycetes) or fungi. As halogenases only from a very limited series of organisms have been explored so far, their natural substrate specificity has been limited. Considerable effort has been invested into the rational redesign and directed evolution of these enzymes to expand or change the substrate",
        "specificity10\u201314.Results and discussionBioinformatics-based discovery of VirX1. We adopted a bioin-formatics-based approach to break from this trend in halometab-olite-led identification of enzymes. Having compiled data from all fully biochemically and structurally characterized FDH enzymes, sequence alignment enabled us to see both of the known GxGxxG and WxWxIP motifs4, as well as a previously unnoticed Fx.Px.Sx.G motif (where \u2018x\u2019 is any amino acid and each \u2018.\u2019 independently repre-sents the number of x between each conserved residue and can be any number: 0, 1, 2 and so on)15. Although GxGxxG and WxWxIP motifs have hitherto been used to indicate the presence of FDHs, GxGxxG could as readily indicate flavin-monooxygenase-related enzymes and the WxWxIP motif is known to be absent in more unusual FDHs such as Bmp516. The Fx.Px.Sx.G motif may be used by itself to mine for halogenases from uncurated genome",

Aligned against known halogenases, VirX1 shows low similarity to the well-studied tryptophan 7-halogenases PrnA and RebH (29% and 31% respectively). It may therefore be classified as being in the twilight zone of sequence similarity18. Generation of a homology structural model of VirX1 using Phyre219 and comparative analysis of this to PrnA and all other structurally characterized halogenases revealed a pyramid-and-box-shape structure that is characteristic of tryp-tophan halogenases4.

        "Oceanic cyanobacteria are the most abundant oxygen-generating phototrophs on our planet and are therefore important to life. These organisms are infected by viruses called cyanophages, which have recently shown to encode metabolic genes that modulate host photosynthesis, phosphorus cycling and nucleotide metabolism. Herein we report the characterization of a wild-type flavin-dependent viral halogenase (VirX1) from a cyanophage. Notably, halogenases have been previously associated with secondary metabolism, tailoring natural products. Exploration of this viral halogenase reveals it capable of regioselective halo-genation of a diverse range of substrates with a preference for forming aryl iodide species; this has potential implications for the metabolism of the infected host. Until recently, a flavin-dependent halogenase that is capable of iodination in\u00a0vitro had not been reported. VirX1 is interesting from a biocatalytic perspective as it shows strikingly broad substrate flexibility and a clear preference for iodination, as illustrated by kinetic analysis. These factors together render it an attractive tool for",

        "GxGxxG.Iodination activity, substrate scope and kinetics of VirX1. We set out to explore whether the encoded protein was indeed an active halogenase and, if so, whether it might show useful biocatalytic utility, including substrate flexibility. To this end, we screened the halogenase against a 400-member library containing substrates that would sterically and electronically challenge the potential catalyst, using liquid chromatography\u2013high resolution mass spectrom-etry (LC\u2013HRMS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) to validate the generation of new halogenated products. Under the conditions of our assay, the enzyme showed very poor activity in chlorinating substrates, but good bromination activity and a surprising preference for iodination. The wild-type enzyme demonstrated striking substrate flexibility (Fig. 2). From this 400-member library, it was determined that 32 sterically and elec-tronically diverse compounds could be accepted as substrates with 1\u201395% conversion (Fig. 2). For each substrate that was processed, LC\u2013HRMS analysis indicated that biotransformative halogenation only resulted in the formation of a monoiodinated product. For the majority of substrates, only a single regioisomer was observed. Enzymatic halogenation could be seen to be mediated on several less reactive or challenging substrates (including (poly)heterocycles (5)20, azaspirocycles (14)21 or bathophenanthroline (30)) that were not readily iodinated using synthetic conditions at room tempera-ture. Fourteen of these products were selected on the basis of both structural interest and conversion level for further analysis, includ-ing spectroscopic structural characterization. This analysis revealed that although halogenation was often mediated at the most chemi-cally reactive position, this was not always the case; for example, enzymatic products 3, 5, 7, 8, 12 and 14 did not match with syn-thetic iodostandards that were prepared by electrophilic iodination, indicating the possibility of different regioisomers being formed (Fig. 2). Steady-state kinetic analysis of the enzyme-catalysed reac-tion was carried out for twelve of these substrates (Table",
        "1).Kinetic analysis revealed the enzyme to have preference for iodide over bromide (Table 1). This is unprecedented as there has been no previous characterization of FDHs with a clear natural pref-erence for iodination in\u00a0vitro. Previous reports exploring whether RebH might mediate iodination revealed through halide competi-tion assays that the introduction of NaI prevented the formation of any chlorinated product, yet no iodinated product was observed22. Conversely, in the competition assays that we explored with VirX1 using equivalent concentrations of NaI, NaBr and NaCl, only the iodinated product could be detected (Supplementary Fig. 17). Under the conditions of our assay, and with all substrates explored, the preference for the halide shown by VirX1 is I > Br > Cl, which corresponds to the decreasing oxidative potential of the",
        "halide.PltM halogenase7 has recently been reported to be flexible in terms of halide versatility, permissibly enabling iodination of phe-nolic substrates. Spectroscopic characterization of the iodinated compounds produced by PltM was not reported (possibly due to the notorious instability of iodinated compounds precluding isolation) nor were any kinetics reported for the reaction as the enzyme was seen to precipitate in the presence of NaI, indicating poor tolerance to this halide19. This versatility of halide utilization observed for PltM\u2014in which iodination is permissible\u2014is perhaps more exten-sive. In this study, we showed that although PrnA could not iodin-ate its natural substrate tryptophan, discernible levels of iodination were evident with a number of its unnatural substrates, though typically at ~1% conversion (Supplementary Table 6). We explored whether PrnA might also mediate halogenation of substrates that are processed by VirX1. We saw that PrnA could process many of the substrates to a low level. It may be that many of the FDHs\u2014in addition to PrnA and PltM\u2014could be capable of very limited or trace iodination in the presence of certain",

The enzyme is shown to monohalogenate a diverse range of sterically and electronically different substrates. Fourteen substrates (boxed) were selected on the basis of both interest in the product and their stability for further verification by either scale-up and spectroscopic characterization of their product or by comparison to synthetic standards that we generated and fully characterized. Iodinated products 1 and 2 were isolated from VirX1 biotransformations, whereas the regiochemistries for 3\u201314 were determined by comparison with synthetic standards. The asterisks denote hypothesized halogenation sites by VirX1 where the enzymatic product did not match with synthetic standards.

        "Chemistryand analytical ultracentrifugation (Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Table 5). The trimer forms a bowl-shaped assembly, with one substrate binding site per monomer that flanks the insides of the bowl (Fig.",
        "3c,d).The structure of VirX1 shows many similarities to other FDHs with the box-shaped flavin binding module (required for flavin binding and generation of the hypohalous acid electrophile) being almost identically folded (Fig. 4a). Both K79 and E358, implicated in haloamine formation and in deprotonation of the Wheland inter-mediate, respectively, occupy similar positions to K79 and E346 in the active site of PrnA (Fig. 4b). The positionings of F99 and Y97 are similar to those seen for F103 and H101 in PrnA complexing the tryptophan (Trp), Cl and FAD (PDB ID: 2AQJ) ligands, which are believed to stabilize the Wheland intermediate4. Assay with mono-chlorodimedone4 indicated that the halogenating species must be enzyme bound (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to identify key catalytic residues, and although the mutants K79A, K79R, F353A, S359A and P356A all yielded soluble proteins (that eluted in a very similar manner to wild-type VirX1, suggesting correct folding of these mutants), each of these mutants were determined to be completely inactive in cata-lysing halogenation of 6-azaindole (1) with either NaI or NaBr, rein-forcing the importance of these residues for the enzyme\u2019s catalytic activity (Supplementary Fig.",
        "16).As anticipated, with all key catalytic residues in place, the \u03b1-helical pyramid-shaped substrate module displays a different arrangement of secondary structure elements to its closest structural homologue PrnA (Fig. 4a). Key differences include the absence of the \u03b1-helical lid that is required for tryptophan halogenases (T435-W455 in PrnA) to close off the tryptophan binding site (as seen in BrvH)25 (Fig. 4c). The substrate binding site of VirX1 displays an even wider opening than BrvH, providing a possible explanation for the wide substrate scope, and the ability to accommodate a halide with a larger van\u00a0der Waals radius (Fig. 4c). Further expansion of the puta-tive substrate binding site is enabled by the increased distance of \u03b117 and \u03b118 from the catalytic residues in it. A further key difference to PrnA, RebH and BrvH is an additional loop (P432-Q442) taking part in the trimer interface through a hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 3b), opening up access to the substrate binding site (Fig.",
        "4).To further explore the VirX1 substrate binding mode, many attempts were made to crystallize VirX1 in complex with various substrates. However, these did not yield sufficiently diffracting crystals for structural analysis, therefore in silico methods were explored instead. Given the subjectivity of in silico small-molecule protein docking experiments, several complementary approaches were explored with both rigid and flexible models of VirX1. Compounds 1\u201314 were docked within a 47.25 \u00d7 47.25 \u00d7 47.25 \u00c5 (105,488 \u00c53) search space centered on rigid VirX1 (chain a), which identified a substrate binding cleft in similar position to other FDHs that harbour K79 and E358. These results informed further docking experiments restricted to this cleft, conducted with rigid and flexible amino acid residues. The flexible docking experi-ments yielded conformations with a decreased binding energy (~5 kcal mol-1) for all substrates compared with docking into the rigid VirX1 pocket (Supplementary Table 2). The choice of hypo-thetical binding modes (Supplementary Figs. 1\u201311) was mainly informed by proximity of the putatively halogenated carbon to K79 that would form and position the iodamine for reaction with the substrate and E358, which would stabilize the Wheland inter-mediate. Through this analysis, three residues were identified to be involved in substrate binding across all docked substrates: Y97, P98 and F99, with the two aromatic resides often seen to be sand-wiching the substrate (Supplementary Figs. 1\u201312). Other residues such as L53, I82 and G100 were also frequently implicated in bind-ing the docked compounds, with the predicted binding mainly comprising hydrophobic contacts (Supplementary Figs. 1\u201312). The docking experiments support binding in a cleft with access to K79 and E358, similarly to characterized complex structures of FDH-substrate complexes4. Several further residues implicated in binding reinforced the extensive active site cavity that enable the strikingly broad substrate flexibility (Supplementary Fig. 12). It is likely that oxidation potential dictates the preference for halide utilization (as indicated by I > Br > Cl) and that it is this enlarged cavity that enables halogenation through a bulky iodamine species.",
        "Conclusions Our results reveal catalytically notable regioselective halogenations by an FDH, with a viral-derived enzyme demonstrating a prefer-ence for iodination. Notably, we also show that by extending the substrate scope of PrnA, iodination in this system may also be permissible. We demonstrate that VirX1 possesses a very broad substrate flexibility and is able to process sterically and electroni-cally demanding substrates in addition to series of nitrogen and",

        "approach26.The role that marine viruses play in manipulating the metabolism of the cyanobacteria they infect has recently been postulated27, and the discovery of an efficient viral halogenase with broad substrate flexibility is therefore interesting. Halogenation of a molecule can subtantially perturb its bioactivity and bioavailability, and iodin-ation can render a molecule highly chemically reactive. Although the levels of iodide in the oceans are very low compared to those for bromide and chloride (0.05 ppm versus 65 ppm and 18,980 ppm, respectively), marine algae and bacteria have been shown to accu-mulate and use iodide28,29. The naturally broad substrate specificity of this enzyme\u2014encoded in a virus that naturally infects the two most abundant photosynthetic organisms on the planet\u2014is fasci-nating and leads one to wonder as to what its natural role might be.

        "graphics.Author contributionsD.S.G. and R.J.M.G. conceived and designed the experiments, and the full programme was carried out under the guidance and direction of R.J.M.G. D.S.G. identified VirX1 bioinformatically, established its protein production and purification, determined the iodinase activity and carried out its biochemical investigation and substrate screening. D.S.G. and H.L. carried out the structural analysis of the enzyme under the guidance of J.H.N. D.S.G. and S.V.S. explored the differential reactivity of the substrates with hypoiodous acid, characterized the products of the iodinase and synthesized standards for comparison to products. W.P.U. and R.J.K.T. synthesized a series of spiroindolic compounds and their derivatives, which were utilized as substrates by the enzyme. M.M.W.M. and S.S. contributed to the selection of compounds for the assaying of the iodinase. H.L., J.A.C. and J.H.N. carried out substrate docking to the iodinase. D.S.G. and J.D. assayed PrnA. D.S.G., H.L., J.A.C., J.D. and Y.W. assisted with cloning and protein production. R.J.M.G., S.V.S., D.S.G., H.L. and J.A.C. wrote the paper with contributions from all",
