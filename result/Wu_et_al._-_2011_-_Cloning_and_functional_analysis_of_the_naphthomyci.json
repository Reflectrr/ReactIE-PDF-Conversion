CSw Yingying Wu,zab Qianjin Kang,za Yuemao Shen,b Wenjin Sub and Linquan Bai*a Received 28th January 2011, Accepted 28th April 2011 DOI: 10.1039/c1mb05036b Naphthomycins (NATs) are 29-membered naphthalenic ansamacrolactam antibiotics with antimicrobial and antineoplastic activities. Their biosynthesis starts from 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid (AHBA). By PCR amplification with primers for AHBA synthase and amino-dehydroquinate (aDHQ) synthase, a genomic region containing orthologs of these genes was identified in Streptomyces sp. CS. It was confirmed to be involved in naphthomycin biosynthesis by deletion of a large DNA fragment, resulting in abolishment of naphthomycin production. A 106 kb region was sequenced, and 32 complete ORFs were identified, including five polyketide synthase genes, eight genes for AHBA synthesis, and putative genes for modification, regulation, transport or resistance. Targeted inactivation and complementation experiments proved that the halogenase gene nat1 is responsible for the chlorination of C-30 of NATs. The nat1 mutant could also be complemented with asm12, the halogenase gene of ansamitocin biosynthesis. Likewise, an asm12 mutant could be complemented with nat1, suggesting a similar catalytic mechanism for both halogenases. A putative hydroxylase gene, nat2, was also inactivated, whereupon the biosynthesis of NATs was completely abolished with a tetraketide desacetyl-SY4b accumulated, indicating the participation of nat2 in the formation of the naphthalene ring. The information presented here expands our understanding of the biosynthesis of naphthalenic ansamycins, and may pave the way for engineering ansamacrolactams with improved pharmaceutical properties. Introduction The naphthomycins (NATs) (Fig. 1A) belong to the family of ansamycin antibiotics, whose characteristic structure comprises an aromatic moiety bridged at nonadjacent positions by an aliphatic chain.1 The aromatic moiety can either be a naphthalene or naphthoquinone ring system, as in rifamycin2 and naphtho-mycin, or a benzene or benzoquinone ring, as in geldanamycin3 and ansamitocin.4 The biosynthesis of ansamycin antibiotics involves the assembly of a polyketide from an unusual starter unit, 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid (AHBA),5 by chain extension with several acetate and propionate units catalyzed by a type I polyketide synthase (PKS). The starter unit AHBA is synthesized via a variant of the shikimate pathway for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (Fig. 1B).6,7 NATs are 29-membered ansamacrolactams with the largest ring reported so far in the ansamycin family. Not only carry-ing the characteristic naphthalene ring and the shifted double bond at C12\u201313, NATs also have a featured triene and there is chlorination on the AHBA moiety of certain NATs. More-over, a variety of nuclear substituents, including methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy, chloro and alkylthio groups, are present at the C-30 of NATs (Fig. 1A). They display significant antimicrobial and antineoplastic activities. Naphthomycin A and B are inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis with selective toxicity against prokaryotes,8 whereas the cytotoxicity of naphthomycin A is exerted through the inhibition of various SH-enzymes, particularly those involved in nucleic acid bio-synthesis.9 NATs have been isolated from different Streptomyces strains, including NAT A from S. diastatochromogenes Tu\u0308 105,10 NAT B from S. galbus subsp. griseosporueus Tu\u0308 353, NAT C from S. collinus Tu\u0308 1892,11 NAT H from Streptomyces sp. Y83,12 and NAT I and J from Streptomyces sp. E/784.13 Recently, an endophytic Streptomyces, isolated from the medicinal plant Maytenus hookeri, namely Streptomyces sp. CS (hereafter called CS), was found to be the producer of naphthomycin A, C, E and K.14 Previous isotope-labeled feeding experiments clearly revealed that the backbone of NATs is assembled by a type I PKS from a State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, and School of Life Sciences & Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China.

Through Southern hybridization with rifK, encoding the AHBA synthase of rifamycin bio-synthesis7 as a probe, a portion of PKS and two complete sets of AHBA biosynthetic genes were cloned from S. collinus Tu\u0308 1892.16 However, the involvement of these genes in naphthomycin biosynthesis has not been confirmed genetically or biochemically. Herein, we report the cloning and sequencing of the naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (nat) from CS, and the investigation of a halogenase gene and a hydroxylase gene required for naphthomycin biosynthesis. Results Cloning and identification of the naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster The only reaction in the proposed biosynthetic pathway of AHBA, which has no analogy in the normal shikimate pathway, is the aromatization of aminoDHS by a postulated AHBA synthase. The AHBA synthase gene then served as a probe allowing the cloning of gene clusters for the biosynthesis of many AHBA-derived antibiotics, such as ansamitocin,17 geldanamycin,18 and mitomycin.19 Since AHBA synthase is Fig. 1 Naphthomycins and the biosynthesis of AHBA.

BioSyst., 2011, 7, 2459\u20132469 2461 highly conserved in the biosynthesis gene clusters of different ansamycins, degenerate primers for AHBA synthase were used to clone the naphthomycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. CS (Fig. S1, ESIw). Fifteen fosmids were identified from a genomic library of CS, which gave products of the expected size. These were further investigated by PCR using a pair of primers specific for napC, the amino-dehydroquinate (aDHQ) synthase gene expected to be involved in naphthomycin C biosynthesis.16 Eventually, 11 overlapping fosmids including fosmid 14F11 were identified, carrying homologs of AHBA synthase and aDHQ synthase genes. In order to confirm the involvement of the region covered by these fosmids in naphthomycin biosynthesis, a 7.2 kb region was replaced by the apramycin resistant gene aac(3)IV in CS. The mutants displayed a complete loss of naphthomycin production on ISP3 medium, confirming the involvement of this region in naphthomycin biosynthesis (Fig. S2, ESIw). Two more fosmids 4C11 and 23G9 were identified by sequential chromosome walking (Fig. 2A), and sequenced together with 14F11. The three fosmids covered a 106 kb region and contained 32 complete open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 2B). The predicted functions of these genes are shown in Table 1. The nat PKS genes Five modular type I PKS genes, nat A\u2013E, are arranged in co-linearity with the predicted assembly of the polyketide backbone, totally encoding one loading module and thirteen extension modules as required for loading of the AHBA starter unit and incorporation of 7 propionate and 6 acetate units. However, two ketoreductase (KR) domains and six dehydratase (DH) domains are predicted to be redundant as deduced from the naphthomycin structure (Fig. 2B and 6). NatA contains a loading domain, consisting of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and an adenylation domain (ADE), presumably required for the activation of the AHBA starter unit, and the modules 1\u20133 for naphthomycin polyketide chain extension. The DH domains of module 1 and module 2 are unusually small with a size of 144 aa and 142 aa, respectively, suggesting both domains are inactive.20 In the KR domain of module 3, the conserved catalytic Y residue21 is mutated to S, which could abolish the ketoreductase activity. NatB contains modules 4\u20136 for the incorporation of two propionate and one acetate units. However, even though the sequence of the DH domain of module 5 seems functional, no dehydration is required in this extension step, as judged from the structure of naphthomycin. NatC hosts modules 7\u20139 and is expected to catalyze the incorporation of an acetate, a propionate, and a further acetate unit, respectively. Similar to the DH domain of module 5, the DH domain of module 7 seems functional but is not required in naphthomycin biosynthesis. Moreover, even though the sequences of the KR and DH domains of module 9 seem functional, both of them are not required for this specific extension step. NatD is a bi-modular protein, presumably for the incorporation of one propionate and one acetate unit. Fig. 2 Gene organization of the naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster.

BioSyst., 2011, 7, 2459\u20132469 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 The DH domain of module 10 looks normal but apparently redundant. NatE comprises modules 12 and 13 and is expected to be responsible for the incorporation of one acetate and one propionate (as in NAT A) or acetate (as in NAT C) units to complete the polyketide assembly. While the typical propionate-specific motif is YASH for AT,22 the motif of AT13 is YPSH, whichmay cause the leaky recognition of the acetate extender unit. Located immediately downstream of natE is natF, which encodes a protein with a high homology to RifF, the enzyme responsible for the polyketide chain-release and cyclization of rifamycin biosynthesis.23 The fully extended polyketide chain of naphthomycin is proposed to be transferred from NatE to NatF, followed by intra-molecular amide bond formation to release a 29-membered pronaphthomycin (Fig. 6). The nat AHBA biosynthetic genes Eight AHBA biosynthetic genes, nat G-N, were identified in the naphthomycin gene cluster from CS (Fig. 2B). Of these, the seven genes natGHIKLMN are apparently organized into a single operon, while the putative aDHQ dehydratase gene natJ is located 4.2 kb downstream of natN (Fig. 1B). These genes had been shown to be involved in naphthomycin biosynthesis through the aforementioned large fragment deletion. The organization and sequence of them show significant homology with other naphthalenic ansamycins, especially rifamycin and naphthomycin C (Fig. S3A, ESIw). According to the well-studied biosynthetic mechanism of AHBA in rifamycin (Fig. 1B), these homologous genes in naphthomycin may carry Table 1 Deduced functions of ORFs in naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster Polypeptide Amino acids Proposed function Sequence similarity (protein, origin) Identity/ similarity Accession number Orf1 567 ATP/GTP-binding protein SAV_1815, S. avermitilis MA-4680 82/91 NP822991 Orf2 711 ATP/GTP-binding protein SAV_1814, S. avermitilis MA-4680 68/79 NP822990 Orf3 47 Conserved hypothetical protein SSEG_07125, S. sviceus ATCC 29083 62/70 YP002202776 Orf4 97 Protoporphyrinogen oxidase Noca_3672, Nocardioides sp.

Nat1 shows 61% identity to the halogenase Asm12 for ansamitocin bio-synthesis, and is considered to be responsible for the chlorination at C-30 in naphthomycin A formation. Nat2 shows 61% identity with Rif-orf19, a 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionate hydroxylase in rifamycin, and is predicted to be involved in the formation of the naphthalene ring of naphthomycins during the polyketide chain elongation (Fig. 6). Orf0 shows sequence similarity to cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and may be involved in the oxidation steps required for the formation of some naphthomycins. Inactivation of halogenase gene nat1 In order to confirm the possible role of nat1 for halogenation at C-30, an 8.24 kb BamHI/EcoRI fragment from fosmid 14F11 carrying this gene was cloned. An internal 1344 bp region of nat1 was replaced by an apramycin resistance gene, resulting in plasmid pJTU3245, with 3.24 kb left-flanking and 3.72 kb right-flanking sequences of the deletion (Fig. 3A). This plasmid was introduced into the wild-type CS strain by conjuga-tion. Five double cross-over mutants (WYY2-1\u2013WYY2-5) were obtained. PCR amplification usingNat1-Det-F andNat1-Det-R as primers confirmed that they gave the expected 1.48 kb PCR product without NcoI restriction site, while the PCR fragment derived from the wild-type was 1.35 kb in size and could be digested into a 0.82 kb fragment and a 0.53 kb fragment by NcoI (Fig. 3B).

Cross-complementation between the halogenase genes of naphthomycin and ansamitocin biosynthesis The inactivation of the nat1 gene had shown that nat1 is responsible for the chlorination reaction at C-30 of naphtho-mycins (Fig. 4A). Nat1 shared high sequence identity (73%) with the previously identified halogenase Asm12 for the biosynthesis of ansamitocin.17 Inactivation of asm12 gave mutant HGF054, which no longer produced ansamitocin-P3, but accumulated a series of 19-deschloro-ansamitocin derivatives.25 The reaction catalyzed by Asm12 was proposed to be modifica-tion of ansamitocins (Fig. 4A).

Plasmids pJTU3243 and pJTU3244, harboring asm12 and nat1, respectively, under the control of the strong constitutive PermE* promoter, were introduced into the asm12 mutant HGF054 by conjugation. Both nat1 and asm12 complemented the production of ansamitocin AP-2, AP-3 and AP-4 to about 100% of the wild-type level (Fig. 4B). The plasmids pJTU3246 and pJTU3247, carrying asm12 and nat1, respectively, were also introduced into the nat1 mutant WYY2 similarly, and both complemented the naphthomycin A production to about 20% of the wild-type level (Fig. 4C). Involvement of Nat2 in naphthalene ring formation The possible involvement of nat2 in the formation of a naphthalene ring was examined by gene replacement and complementation. In the plasmid pJTU1289, a 980 bp internal fragment of nat2 was replaced by the apramycin-resistance gene aac(3)IV, inserted between a 3.94 kb left-flanking and a 3.98 kb right-flanking sequence, resulting in plasmid pJTU3250 (Fig. 5A). Four thiostrepton-sensitive and apramycin-resistant (ThioS AprR) recombinant mutants (WYY3-1\u2013WYY3-4) were obtained. Total DNAs from these mutants and the wild-type were used as templates for PCR analysis with primers Nat2-Det-F and Nat2-Det-R. The wild-type gave the expected 1.0 kb PCR product without MluI site, whereas the mutants gave a 1.3 kb PCR product, which could be digested by MluI into a 1.0 kb fragment and a 0.3 kb fragment (Fig. 5B). LC-MS analysis of the fermentation extract of the mutant strains showed a complete abolishment of the production of all the naphthomycins (Fig. 5C).

LC-MS analysis of the extract of complemented mutants showed the production of naphthomycins was almost fully restored by nat2, and to about 30% of the wild-type level by rif-orf19 (Fig. 5C). Additionally, nat2was introduced into HGF065, a proansamitocin producer with mutated asm12 and asm21, to detect if there was any new derivative with a naphthanene ring or oxygenated derivative of proansamitocin. However, no detectable peak for expected compounds was observed in the complemented strains with nat2 (data not shown). Discussion A few biosynthetic gene clusters of ansamycins had been identified and sequenced, including rifamycin and rubradirin in the naphthalenic family, and ansamitocin, geldanamycin, and herbimycin of the benzenic family. Since their AHBA synthase genes had been verified to be conserved in ansamycins (Fig. S1, ESIw), the naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in CS was obtained by PCR screening using degenerate primers designed from rifK and other AHBA biosynthetic genes. Compared to other ansamycins, the arrangement of gene cluster and chemical structures of naphthomycins are very similar to rifamycin from Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699, suggesting a close genetic relationship between the biosynthesis of naphthomycin and rifamycin. As in rifamycin, eight genes are proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the AHBA unit for naphthomycin (Fig. 2). The gene natI, homologous with rifI, putatively encodes aminoquinate dehydrogenase to regulate the AHBA pool to prevent the uncontrolled accumulation of AHBA in the cell (Fig. S3A, ESIw).24 Additionally, the organizations of AHBA biosynthetic genes and the AHBA synthases show prominent differences between naphthalenic and benzenic ansamycin biosynthetic genes (Fig. S3A and S3B, ESIw). Surprisingly, extreme redundancy of reduction domains were identified in nat polyketide synthase as deduced from the structure of NATs. Among 13 elongation modules, 2 ketoreductase (KR) and 6 dehydratase (DH) domains were found to be redundant in 7 modules including module 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 (Fig. 2B and 6). Interestingly, the redundancy of reductive domains is found to be prevalent in the PKS for naphthalenic ansamycin biosynthesis. In rifamycin PKS, five DH domains and 1 KR domain in 7 of the 10 elongation modules were found to be redundant for the biosynthesis of the 25-membered rifamycin B.23 Moreover in rubradirin PKS, 3 DH domains and 2 KR domains in 4 of the 6 elongation modules were identified to be not required for the biosynthesis of the 15-membered rubradirin.30 However, the redundant domain has so far not been found in the published PKSs for the biosynthesis of benzenic ansamycins including ansamitocin, geldanamycin, and herbimycin.17,18,31 Although the redundant domains are not likely to be functional for the PKS structure, it is proposed that they could retain the structural and catalytic integrity as stand-alone PKS proteins.32 In nature, the presence of halogenation usually improves the biological activity of secondary metabolites.33 In ansamycins, both Nat1 for naphthomycin and Asm12 for ansamitocin biosynthesis were categorized to be flavin-dependent Fig. 6 Putative naphthomycin biosynthetic pathway.

The flavin-dependent halogenases are usually two-component systems, in which a flavin reductase is required to regenerate the FADH2 for catalytic turnover. 34 Since gene deletion study suggested Asm12 catalyzes the first step of ansamitocin post-polyketide modification, further research into the detailed function of Asm12 is needed. The successful cross complementation experiment points to a similar substrate for Nat1 and Asm12 in the biosynthesis of naphthomycins and ansamitocins, respectively. However, expected products of chloro-proansamitocin and naphthomycin A could not be detected in vitro using the predicted substrates of proansamitocin and naphthomycin E with purified Asm12 and Nat1, respectively (data not shown). One possibility is that the substrates for Nat1 and Asm12 could be ACP-bound intermediates. The other explanation is the rapid decomposition of free FADH2 with molecular oxygen into FAD and H2O2, which leads to a significant decrease in halogenase activity.34 The nat2 gene, putatively encoding a 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate hydroxylase and homologous to Rif-Orf19 in rifamycin23 and RubP1 in rubradirin,30 was proposed to be involved in the naphthalene ring formation of naphthomycins. Since the disruption of rif-orf19 ceased production of rifamycin B and caused the accumulation of the tetraketides SY4b and desacetyl-SY4b, Rif-Orf19 was assumed to introduce a hydroxyl group into the acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound tetraketide. This sets the stage for further enzymatically catalyzed or spontaneous cyclization reaction to form the naphthalene ring. However, whether a single enzyme or a complex group of enzymes is responsible for the entire process remains to be investigated.29 In Streptomyces CS, disruption of nat2 abolished the production of all the naphthomycin components and accumulated tetraketide desacetyl-SY4b. Moreover, both nat2 and rif-orf19 could complement the production of naphthomycins in the nat2 mutant, implicating the role of Nat2 in the biosynthesis of naphthalene ring formation. Besides naphthalenic ansamycins, nat2 homologs had been reported to be involved in the oxidation of benzenic ansamycins, such as gdmM andmcbM from geldanamycin and macbecin biosynthetic gene cluster, respectively.18,35 In silico analysis of the amino acid sequences revealed that all the proteins within this family contain typical nucleotide-binding motifs GXGXXG (motif I), DGXXSXXR (motif II) and GDXXH (motif III) for flavoprotein hydroxylases (Fig. S5A, ESIw).36,37 Similar to the AHBA synthases, these hydrolases could be divided into two distinct clades either for naphthalenic or benzenic ansamycin biosynthesis by phylogenetic analysis, reflecting divergent biosynthetic routes for these two subgroups of ansamycins (Fig. S5B, ESIw). Deduced from the abovementioned results, the biosynthetic pathway for naphthomycin A was proposed (Fig. 6). Initiated with the AHBA starter unit, the polyketide backbone of naphthomycin A is extended with the incorporation of 2 methyl-malonyl-CoA and 1 malonyl-CoA to generate a tetraketide tethered to the ACP of module 3. The discrete four-module NatA and three-module NatB may provide an inter-molecule space allowing the accessibility and the oxidation of the tetraketide intermediate by Nat2, followed with an spontaneous intra-molecular cyclization to form the naphthalene ring.29 The tetraketide with naphthalene ring is then extended with 5 methyl-malonyl-CoA and 5 malonyl-CoA extender units, producing a linear polyketide chain tethered to the ACP of module 13. Subsequently, the nascent polyketide chain is transferred, hydrolyzed, and cyclized by the amide synthase NatF to form the 29-membered pronaphthomycin. Even though no obvious dehydratase gene is identified in the nat gene cluster, a dehydration step, rather than the proposed dehydrogenation in rifamycin biosynthesis, is required for the aromatization of the naphthalene ring to generate NAT E. Finally, NAT E is converted to NAT A through chlorination catalyzed by Nat1 (Fig. 6). Experimental procedures Materials and general methods Streptomyces CS14 was grown at 30 1C in TSBY medium (3% TSB, 1% yeast extract, 10.3% sucrose, pH 7.2, w/v) for liquid cultivation and on ISP3 agar plates (2% agar, 20% oatmeal, 1 ml trace element solution, pH 7.2, w/v) supplemented with 1% w/v leave extract of Maytenus austroyunnanensis and 0.6% (w/v) KNO3.

        "Naphthomycins (NATs) are 29-membered naphthalenic ansamacrolactam antibiotics with antimicrobial and antineoplastic activities. Their biosynthesis starts from 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid (AHBA). By PCR amplification with primers for AHBA synthase and amino-dehydroquinate (aDHQ) synthase, a genomic region containing orthologs of these genes was identified in Streptomyces sp. CS. It was confirmed to be involved in naphthomycin biosynthesis by deletion of a large DNA fragment, resulting in abolishment of naphthomycin production. A 106 kb region was sequenced, and 32 complete ORFs were identified, including five polyketide synthase genes, eight genes for AHBA synthesis, and putative genes for modification, regulation, transport or resistance. Targeted inactivation and complementation experiments proved that the halogenase gene nat1 is responsible for the chlorination of C-30 of NATs. The nat1 mutant could also be complemented with asm12, the halogenase gene of ansamitocin biosynthesis. Likewise, an asm12 mutant could be complemented with nat1, suggesting a similar catalytic mechanism for both halogenases. A putative hydroxylase gene, nat2, was also inactivated, whereupon the biosynthesis of NATs was completely abolished with a tetraketide desacetyl-SY4b accumulated, indicating the participation of nat2 in the formation of the naphthalene ring. The information presented here expands our understanding of the biosynthesis of naphthalenic ansamycins, and may pave the way for engineering ansamacrolactams with improved pharmaceutical properties.",
        "Introduction The naphthomycins (NATs) (Fig. 1A) belong to the family of ansamycin antibiotics, whose characteristic structure comprises an aromatic moiety bridged at nonadjacent positions by an aliphatic chain.1 The aromatic moiety can either be a naphthalene or naphthoquinone ring system, as in rifamycin2 and naphtho-mycin, or a benzene or benzoquinone ring, as in geldanamycin3 and ansamitocin.4 The biosynthesis of ansamycin antibiotics involves the assembly of a polyketide from an unusual starter unit, 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid (AHBA),5 by chain extension with several acetate and propionate units catalyzed by a type I polyketide synthase (PKS). The starter unit AHBA is synthesized via a variant of the shikimate pathway for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (Fig. 1B).6,7",
        "NATs are 29-membered ansamacrolactams with the largest ring reported so far in the ansamycin family. Not only carry-ing the characteristic naphthalene ring and the shifted double bond at C12\u201313, NATs also have a featured triene and there is chlorination on the AHBA moiety of certain NATs. More-over, a variety of nuclear substituents, including methyl, hydroxyl, methoxy, chloro and alkylthio groups, are present at the C-30 of NATs (Fig. 1A). They display significant antimicrobial and antineoplastic activities. Naphthomycin A and B are inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis with selective toxicity against prokaryotes,8 whereas the cytotoxicity of naphthomycin A is exerted through the inhibition of various SH-enzymes, particularly those involved in nucleic acid bio-synthesis.9 NATs have been isolated from different Streptomyces strains, including NAT A from S. diastatochromogenes Tu\u0308 105,10 NAT B from S. galbus subsp. griseosporueus Tu\u0308 353, NAT C from S. collinus Tu\u0308 1892,11 NAT H from Streptomyces sp.

        "Discussion A few biosynthetic gene clusters of ansamycins had been identified and sequenced, including rifamycin and rubradirin in the naphthalenic family, and ansamitocin, geldanamycin, and herbimycin of the benzenic family. Since their AHBA synthase genes had been verified to be conserved in ansamycins (Fig. S1, ESIw), the naphthomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in CS was obtained by PCR screening using degenerate primers designed from rifK and other AHBA biosynthetic genes. Compared to other ansamycins, the arrangement of gene cluster and chemical structures of naphthomycins are very similar to rifamycin from Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699, suggesting a close genetic relationship between the biosynthesis of naphthomycin and rifamycin. As in rifamycin, eight genes are proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the AHBA",

The gene natI, homologous with rifI, putatively encodes aminoquinate dehydrogenase to regulate the AHBA pool to prevent the uncontrolled accumulation of AHBA in the cell (Fig. S3A, ESIw).24 Additionally, the organizations of AHBA biosynthetic genes and the AHBA synthases show prominent differences between naphthalenic and benzenic ansamycin biosynthetic genes (Fig. S3A and S3B, ESIw). Surprisingly, extreme redundancy of reduction domains were identified in nat polyketide synthase as deduced from the structure of NATs. Among 13 elongation modules, 2 ketoreductase (KR) and 6 dehydratase (DH) domains were found to be redundant in 7 modules including module 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 (Fig. 2B and 6). Interestingly, the redundancy of reductive domains is found to be prevalent in the PKS for naphthalenic ansamycin biosynthesis. In rifamycin PKS, five DH domains and 1 KR domain in 7 of the 10 elongation modules were found to be redundant for the biosynthesis of the 25-membered rifamycin B.23 Moreover in rubradirin PKS, 3 DH domains and 2 KR domains in 4 of the 6 elongation modules were identified to be not required for the biosynthesis of the 15-membered rubradirin.30 However, the redundant domain has so far not been found in the published PKSs for the biosynthesis of benzenic ansamycins including ansamitocin, geldanamycin, and herbimycin.17,18,31 Although the redundant domains are not likely to be functional for the PKS structure, it is proposed that they could retain the structural and catalytic integrity as stand-alone PKS proteins.32 In nature, the presence of halogenation usually improves the biological activity of secondary metabolites.33 In ansamycins, both Nat1 for naphthomycin and Asm12 for ansamitocin biosynthesis were categorized to be flavin-dependent",

The flavin-dependent halogenases are usually two-component systems, in which a flavin reductase is required to regenerate the FADH2 for catalytic turnover. 34 Since gene deletion study suggested Asm12 catalyzes the first step of ansamitocin post-polyketide modification, further research into the detailed function of Asm12 is needed. The successful cross complementation experiment points to a similar substrate for Nat1 and Asm12 in the biosynthesis of naphthomycins and ansamitocins, respectively. However, expected products of chloro-proansamitocin and naphthomycin A could not be detected in vitro using the predicted substrates of proansamitocin and naphthomycin E with purified Asm12 and Nat1, respectively (data not shown). One possibility is that the substrates for Nat1 and Asm12 could be ACP-bound intermediates.

        "The nat2 gene, putatively encoding a 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate hydroxylase and homologous to Rif-Orf19 in rifamycin23 and RubP1 in rubradirin,30 was proposed to be involved in the naphthalene ring formation of naphthomycins. Since the disruption of rif-orf19 ceased production of rifamycin B and caused the accumulation of the tetraketides SY4b and desacetyl-SY4b, Rif-Orf19 was assumed to introduce a hydroxyl group into the acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound tetraketide. This sets the stage for further enzymatically catalyzed or spontaneous cyclization reaction to form the naphthalene ring. However, whether a single enzyme or a complex group of enzymes is responsible for the entire process remains to be investigated.29 In Streptomyces CS, disruption of nat2 abolished the production of all the naphthomycin components and accumulated tetraketide desacetyl-SY4b. Moreover, both nat2 and rif-orf19 could complement the production of naphthomycins in the nat2 mutant, implicating the role of Nat2 in the biosynthesis of naphthalene ring formation. Besides naphthalenic ansamycins, nat2 homologs had been reported to be involved in the oxidation of benzenic ansamycins, such as gdmM andmcbM from geldanamycin and macbecin biosynthetic gene cluster, respectively.18,35 In silico analysis of the amino acid sequences revealed that all the proteins within this family contain typical nucleotide-binding motifs GXGXXG (motif I), DGXXSXXR (motif II) and GDXXH (motif III) for flavoprotein hydroxylases (Fig. S5A, ESIw).36,37 Similar to the AHBA synthases, these hydrolases could be divided into two distinct clades either for naphthalenic or benzenic ansamycin biosynthesis by phylogenetic analysis, reflecting divergent biosynthetic routes for these two subgroups of ansamycins (Fig. S5B, ESIw).",
        "Deduced from the abovementioned results, the biosynthetic pathway for naphthomycin A was proposed (Fig. 6). Initiated with the AHBA starter unit, the polyketide backbone of naphthomycin A is extended with the incorporation of 2 methyl-malonyl-CoA and 1 malonyl-CoA to generate a tetraketide tethered to the ACP of module 3. The discrete four-module NatA and three-module NatB may provide an inter-molecule space allowing the accessibility and the oxidation of the tetraketide intermediate by Nat2, followed with an spontaneous intra-molecular cyclization to form the naphthalene ring.29 The tetraketide with naphthalene ring is then extended with",
        "5 methyl-malonyl-CoA and 5 malonyl-CoA extender units, producing a linear polyketide chain tethered to the ACP of module 13. Subsequently, the nascent polyketide chain is transferred, hydrolyzed, and cyclized by the amide synthase NatF to form the 29-membered pronaphthomycin. Even though no obvious dehydratase gene is identified in the nat gene cluster, a dehydration step, rather than the proposed dehydrogenation in rifamycin biosynthesis, is required for the aromatization of the naphthalene ring to generate NAT E. Finally, NAT E is converted to NAT A through chlorination catalyzed by Nat1 (Fig. 6).",
