The de-duced product of rebM is similar to S-adenosylme-gomonas sp. DxnD (32% identity, 47% similarity) and RebC (63% identity, 71% similarity). According to this, thionine-dependent methyltransferases, including a methyltransferase from Amycolatopsis mediterraneia monooxygenase such as RebC could catalyze decar-boxylative monooxygenations, as shown for Sphingo-(accession number AAC01738) and MitM from Strepto-myces lavendulae [31].

In particular, The deduced product of rebF belongs to a family of Rebeccamycin Gene Cluster 525 Figure 3. Proposed Biosynthetic Pathway for Rebeccamycin Chemistry & Biology 526 NysRI from Streptomyces noursei [45]. We propose that RebR could function as a transcriptional activator of the expression of rebeccamycin biosynthetic genes, and some experimental evidence (see below) points toward this idea. Genes Probably Not Involved in Rebeccamycin Biosynthesis Results from database searching were not significant enough for us to propose functions for orfD13, orfR3, and orfD2. On one hand, deduced gene products of orfD13 (truncated) and orfR3 did not have any homologs in the databases, so their possible functions are un-known. On the other hand, OrfD2 is similar to conserved hypothetical proteins from several bacteria, includ-ing CC0823 from Caulobacter crescentus [17] and SCF41.20c from S. coelicolor [21]. It also shows weak, limited similarities to putative 2-hydroxyhepta-2,4-diene-1,7-dioate isomerases such as BH2000 from Ba-cillus halodurans [46], but at the moment we do not feel this is enough to propose a function for OrfD2. Deduced products of another group of ORFs (orfR5, orfR4, and orfD1) showed similarities to proteins of known functions, but these proteins are apparently unre-lated to rebeccamycin biosynthesis. OrfR5 resembles AfsR, a global regulatory protein conditionally required for secondary metabolism in S. coelicolor [47]. OrfR4 is similar to putative dipeptidase SCC53.19 from S. coeli-color [21] and to Synechocystis sp. confirmed D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase SynVanX, probably having a role in cell-wall turnover [48]. Finally, the deduced product of orfD1 is probably a secreted protein with a signal peptide cleaved between amino acids 47 and 48 (as predicted by the SignalP program [49]) and resembles hypothetical protein SC6E10.10 from S. coelicolor [21] and fusidic-acid esterase FusH, an extracellular enzyme from S. lividans [50]. At the right end of the sequenced region (Figure 2A), orfD12 (incomplete) encodes the N-terminal part of a protein homologous to MarR family regulatory proteins, many of which respond to phenolic compounds [51]. Highest similarities were found to hypothetical tran-scriptional regulators Rv2887 from Mycobacterium tu-berculosis [52] and SC1A4.04 from S. coelicolor [21]. The involvement of OrfD12 in gene regulation for rebec-camycin biosynthesis is unclear because rebeccamycin Figure 4.

We propose that RebR could function as a transcriptional activator of the expression of rebeccamycin biosynthetic genes, and some experimental evidence (see below) points toward this idea. Genes Probably Not Involved in Rebeccamycin Biosynthesis Results from database searching were not significant enough for us to propose functions for orfD13, orfR3, and orfD2. On one hand, deduced gene products of orfD13 (truncated) and orfR3 did not have any homologs in the databases, so their possible functions are un-known. On the other hand, OrfD2 is similar to conserved hypothetical proteins from several bacteria, includ-ing CC0823 from Caulobacter crescentus [17] and SCF41.20c from S. coelicolor [21]. It also shows weak, limited similarities to putative 2-hydroxyhepta-2,4-diene-1,7-dioate isomerases such as BH2000 from Ba-cillus halodurans [46], but at the moment we do not feel this is enough to propose a function for OrfD2. Deduced products of another group of ORFs (orfR5, orfR4, and orfD1) showed similarities to proteins of known functions, but these proteins are apparently unre-lated to rebeccamycin biosynthesis. OrfR5 resembles AfsR, a global regulatory protein conditionally required for secondary metabolism in S. coelicolor [47]. OrfR4 is similar to putative dipeptidase SCC53.19 from S. coeli-color [21] and to Synechocystis sp. confirmed D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase SynVanX, probably having a role in cell-wall turnover [48]. Finally, the deduced product of orfD1 is probably a secreted protein with a signal peptide cleaved between amino acids 47 and 48 (as predicted by the SignalP program [49]) and resembles hypothetical protein SC6E10.10 from S. coelicolor [21] and fusidic-acid esterase FusH, an extracellular enzyme from S. lividans [50]. At the right end of the sequenced region (Figure 2A), orfD12 (incomplete) encodes the N-terminal part of a protein homologous to MarR family regulatory proteins, many of which respond to phenolic compounds [51]. Highest similarities were found to hypothetical tran-scriptional regulators Rv2887 from Mycobacterium tu-berculosis [52] and SC1A4.04 from S. coelicolor [21].
