Characterization of Nonheme Type Bromoperoxidase in Corallina  pilulifera* (Received for publication, October 18, 1985) Nobuya  Itoh,  Yoshikazu  Izumi,  and  Hideaki  Yamada From the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture,  Kyoto  University, Sakyo-ku Kyoto 606, Japan Bromoperoxidase was purified from the crude ex-tract of Corallina pilulifera to  be  homogeneous  upon polyacrylamide disc gel and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses according to the procedures previously reported (Itoh, N., Izumi, Y., and  Yamada, H. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com-mun. 13 1, 428-435). The enzyme had a molecular weight  of  approximately 790,000 and was composed of 12 subunits of identical molecular weights (Mr 64,000). Hexagonal molecular shapes of the enzyme were  observed  by  electron  microscopy.  The  isoelectric point  of  the  enzyme was 3.0, and  the  predominance  of acidic  amino  acids was revealed by  amino  acid analysis of  the  enzyme.  The  enzyme was specific  for  I-and  Br-and inactive toward C1-and F-. The optimum pH of the  enzyme was 6.0, and  the  enzyme was stable  in  a range  from pH 5.0 to 11.0. The  enzyme  had  no  heme-or flavin-like compounds as a  prosthetic  group.  Plasma emission  spectroscopy revealed that  the  enzyme  con-tains 2.3 f 0.2 atoms  of  iron  and 1.6 2 0.1 atoms of magnesium/molecule of protein.  Hence,  bromoperoxi-dase  of C. pilulifera was distinct  from  other  haloperox-idases  and  many  peroxidases,  which  are  hemoproteins. A diversity of peroxidases, which catalyze the peroxidative oxidation of many compounds, has been reported in  animal and plant tissues and microorganisms. Until now, various types of peroxidases including NAD+ peroxidase (2), NADP+ peroxidase (3), fatty acid peroxidase (4), cytochrome peroxi-dase (5,6), catalase  (7), peroxidase (8),  glutathione peroxidase (9, lo), iodoperoxidase (11), bromoperoxidase (12-16), and chloroperoxidase (17-19) have been investigated. Among them, haloperoxidases are very interesting enzymes that  in-troduce the halogen-carbon bond in many organic compounds (20). Haloperoxidases are divided into  three groups according to  the specificity for the halide ion: chloroperoxidase, brom-operoxidase, and iodoperoxidase. Chloroperoxidase, which was found in Caldariomyces fu-mago by Hager and co-workers (17,18),  has been well studied. The enzyme catalyzes the chlorination, bromination, and iodination of various compounds through electrophilic substi-tution  (19,21)  andaddition mechanism (22,23). We also have studied the specificity, stereoselectivity, and reaction mecha-nism of the chloroperoxidase reaction using trans-cinnamic acid substrates (24). Myeloperoxidase can also catalyze the oxidation of all halide ions except F-(25). Recently, bromoperoxidase, which is specific for I-and Br-, has been reported in several marine algae such as Rhodomela * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges. This article must therefore be hereby marked \u2018\u2018advertisement\u201d in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Section 1734 solely to indicate this fact. (13), Rhipocephalus, and Penicillus (12). The enzyme is con-sidered to participate in the synthesis of halocompounds in the marine environment  (13,26). Neidleman and Geigert (25) reported that lactoperoxidase catalyzes the bromination re-action. van P6e and Lingens detected bromoperoxidase activ-ity in the chloramphenicol-producing actinomycete, Strepto-myces  phueochromogenes (15),  and  they purified the enzyme from Pseudomonas  aureofaciens (16). Iodoperoxidase, which is represented by thyroid peroxidase, does not  activate C1-and Br-. Horseradish peroxidase oxi-dizes only I-(25). The above haloperoxidases and peroxidases are  all heme-containing enzymes except NAD+ and NADP+ peroxidases, glutathione peroxidase, and  fatty acid peroxidase. NAD+ per-oxidase possesses FAD as  a  prosthetic group (2),  and gluta-thione peroxidase contains four selenium atoms/molecule of the enzyme (10). The detailed properties of NADP+ peroxi-dase and  fatty acid peroxidase have not been investigated. In  the previous study, we found that coralline alga contains a large amount of bromoperoxidase and demonstrated the bromination of phenol derivatives such as phenol and o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol with the enzyme (27). We also estab-lished the purification procedures for the enzyme from Cor-allinapilulifera and found that  the enzyme contains no heme-like compound as a  prosthetic group (1). The present com-munication describes in  detail the properties of bromoperox-idase derived from C. pilulifera. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals-SDS-gel electrophoresis calibration proteins and DEAE-Sepharose CL-4B were purchased from Pharmacia  Fine Chemicals, Sweden, and marker  proteins for molecular weight deter-mination on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from Oriental Yeast Co., Japan. Cellulofine GC-700  was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Japan. Analytical reagent grade hydrogen peroxide and standard iron and magnesium solutions were supplied by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, and o-dianisidine and standard iodine solution by Nakarai Chemicals, Japan. Superpure reagents of potassium iodide, potassium chloride, and potassium fluoride were obtained from Merck Japan Ltd., Japan. Carrier ampholyte was supplied by LKB, Sweden. Other reagents used in this study were all commercial products of analytical grade. Collection of Alga-C. pilulifera was collected from shallow water (0.5-1.0 m deep) on the shore of Shirahama (Wakayama Prefecture), Japan in April, 1984, and frozen at -20 \u201cC until use. the crude extract of C. pilulifera as previously reported (1). The Purification of the Enzyme-Bromoperoxidase  was purified from purified enzyme was homogeneous using polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Enzyme Assay-Bromoperoxidase activity was assayed by measur-ing the change in absorbance at 290  nm due to conversion of mon-ochlorodimedone to monobromomonochlorodimedone (27). Assay of the oxidation of iodide was carried out according to the modified The abbreviations used are: SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 5194 This is an Open Access article under theCC BY Nonheme Type Bromoperoxidase of Corallim pilulifera 5195 method of Hosoya (28). Catalase activity was measured at 240 nm by the modified method of Beers and Sizer (29). The detailed reaction conditions were described in the previous paper (27). Peroxidase activity was measured with o-dianisidine at 25 \"C (30). In all cases, 1 unit of enzyme activity  is the  amount of the enzyme that converts 1 wmol  of substrate  in 1 min at 25  \"C. Protein Determination-The protein  concentration of bromo-peroxidase was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using the equation: E;%., = 8.05 (data below). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis-Analytical disc gel electropho-resis was performed in 7.0% polyacrylamide gel with Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 8.9) according to  the method of Davis (31). The samples were run at 3.0 mA/gel at  4 \"C. The gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and destained in methanol/acetic acid/HzO (127).  Staining of gels for glycoprotein was performed by the periodic acid oxidation and Schiff stain method developed by Signoret and Crouzet (32). SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed in 10% polyacrylamide slab gel using a Tris-glycine buffer system de-scribed by King and Laemmli (33). Molecular weight of the subunit of the enzyme was estimated from the relative mobility of standard proteins. Isoelectric Focusing-The isoelectric point of the enzyme was de-termined as described by Vesterberg (34) using Ampholine electro-focusing equipment (110-ml column). A mixture of Ampholine LKB (pH range of  2.5-4.0) and Ampholine LKB (pH range of  3.5-10) (51, by volume) was used as  the carrier ampholyte. The samples were run at  500 V for 48 h at 4 \"C. The column was then attached to a fraction collector, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Absorption at 280 nm, pH, and enzyme activity were measured for each fraction. Sedimentation Study-The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by the ultracentrifugal sedimentation equilibrium method according to the procedure of Van Holde and Baldwin (35). The experiments were carried out with a  Hitachi analytical ultracentrifuge (model 282) equipped with Rayleigh interference optics. Multicell operations were employed in order to perform the experiments on two samples of different  initial  concentrations (1.0 and 0.7 mg/ml) with the use of the RAM-18SC rotor and a 3-sample centerpiece cell. Protein solutions, which had been dialyzed against the reference solvent (0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), were used as samples. Centrifugation proceeded for 48 h at 25 \"C at 3000 rpm, and the interference patterns were photographed to compare and ensure that  the equilibrium was established. The relation between the con-centration of the enzyme and  the fringe shift was determined by the use of the synthetic boundary cell. High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Analytical HPLC was carried out with a Hitachi 638 system equipped with a TSK-Gel G4000sw column (0.75 X 60 cm, Toyosoda Co., Japan)  at  the flow rate of  0.3 ml/min using 50 mM potasium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 M NaC1. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined from the calibration curve of standard proteins as follows: acyl-CoA oxidase, 600,000; glutamate dehydrogenase, 290,000; lactate dehydrogenase, 142,000; enolase, 67,000; adenylate kinase, 32,000; cytochrome c, 12,400. Electron Microscope Analysis-For electron microscopy, the  en-zymes  were negatively stained with 2% uranyl  acetate (pH 4.5) or 2% phosphotungstic acid (adjusted to  pH 7.0  by KOH).  A drop of enzyme solution (0.1-0.2 mg of protein/ml), which had been dialyzed against 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0),  was applied on an electron microscopic grid covered with a collodion film. The excess solution was blotted off with filter paper, and  then a drop of 2% uranyl acetate or phosphotungstic acid solution was added, blotted, and dried. The grid was observed by a JEM-100C or JEM-1200EX electron micro-scope (JEOL,  Japan).  The observations were done at magnifications of 50,000, 80,000, or 100,000. The specimens were photographed by exposure on Fuji FG films (Fuji Photo Film Co., Japan). Dry Weight Extinction Coefficient-A definite volume of concen-trated solution of bromoperoxidase, which had been extensively di-alyzed against  10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and  its absorbance measured at 280 nm, was transferred  into the separate stainless vessels. The vessels were placed in the oven at 95 \"C for 24 h and weighted after cooling at 1-day intervals  until  constant weights were achieved. The difference of weights of the vessels containing protein solution and buffer control was used to calculate the dry weight of the enzyme sample. From these data, the average of Amino Acid Composition-Amino acid analyses were performed according to  the method of Spackman et al. (36) on an automatic \",,, of 8.05 could be calculated. amino acid analyzer K101-AS (Kyowa Seimitsu CO., Japan) with authentic  materials as a  standard. Samples were  hydrolyzed in  6 N HC1 under a vacuum for 24, 48, and 72 h at 110 \"C. Cysteine and cystine were determined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation (37). Tryptophan  content was estimated by the method of Spies and Chambers (38) with authentic  tryptophan as a  standard. Absorption Spectra-Absorption spectra were measured in cuvettes of 1-cm path length with a Shimadzu UV-240 spectrophotometer at 20  \"C equipped with a Shimadzu PR-1 computer-controlled graphic recorder. Flauin Analysis-Flavin analysis of enzyme solution was performed fluorometrically with a  Hitachi 204-R spectrophotofluorometer (ex-citation, 450 nm; emission, 535 nm) by the procedure of Siegel et al. (39). The enzyme solutions, diluted to about 150 and 100  pg/ml with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.7), were boiled for 3 min, while protected from light, to cause release of flavin. Then, the fluorescence of 2.5-ml aliquots was measured, and following the addition of  0.25 ml of 1 N HCI, measured again. Buffer was used as the control. Standard FMN and FAD solutions in the same buffer were treated  in parallel with the enzyme solutions. Labile Sulfide Analysis-Acid-labile sulfide content of the enzyme samples was measured according to  the method of King and Morris (40) and Siegel et al. (39) with sodium sulfide as a  standard. Standard solutions of sodium sulfide were prepared as described by King and Morris (40), and  their concentrations determined iodometrically. Metal Analysis-All glassware was  boiled briefly in 2 N HCl and then exhaustively rinsed with distilled water before use. The enzyme samples containing 1.0-3.0  mg  of protein/ml were measured with an ICAP-500 argon plasma emission spectrophotometer (Nippon Jarrell-Ash Co., Japan). Before assays, the enzyme samples were dialyzed against 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with or without 1 mM EDTA or o-phenanthroline. The following assay conditions were employed for qualitative analysis: cooling  gas, 14 liters/min; plasma gas, 2 liters/min; sample gas, 0.5 liter/min; sample inhalation, 1 ml/ min. The spectra were scanned from 400 to 190 nm at a speed of  25 nm/min. Quantitative analyses of iron and magnesium of enzyme samples were also carried out with the same  apparatus by measuring the plasma emission spectroscopy at 259.94 nm for iron and 279.55 nm for magnesium. The metal contents of the enzyme samples were determined from the calibration curves of standard solutions. RESULTS Molecular  Weight and  Subunit Structure-Equilibrium ul-tracentrifugation was employed to determine the molecular weight of the enzyme. The linearity of the plot as log fr (fringe shift) uersuS 12 demonstrated that  the purified enzyme was homogeneous. The molecular weight was estimated to be 790,000 k 20,000 from the slope of the  data plotted, assuming a  partial specific volume (fi) of  0.74. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 880,000 by analytical HPLC on TSK Gel G4000sw column which was calibrated with standard proteins. On SDS-slab gel electrophoresis, a single band of the enzyme  was observed, and  the subunit molecular weight of the enzyme  was  64,000  from the calibration curve of the reference proteins (Fig. 1). These data indicated that the enzyme of C. pilulifera consists of 12 subunits of identical molecular weight. Fig. 2a shows the electron micrograph of the uranyl  acetate negatively stained image of the enzyme. Uranyl acetate  stain-ing was superior to phosphotungstic acid staining in display-ing the fine structures of the enzymes. In the photograph, two distinct images  were  observed. In image A, the enzyme appears to be hexagonal with a symmetry axis (15-16 nm). Image B, which shows a cleavage line bisecting the rectangular figures (10-11 X 15-16 nm), may represent a view perpendicular to the symmetry axis. From an analysis of these images, we concluded that  the complete structure of the enzyme  was a dodecad aggregate composed of two hexagons face to face, as schematically illustrated  in Fig. 2b. Isoelectric Point  and Amino  Acid  Composition-Isoelectric analysis of the purified enzyme revealed that a single protein peak was coincident with the peak of bromoperoxidase activ-5 196 Nonheme  Type Bromoperoxidase of Corallina pilulifera a) as 1 2  3 4 5 -+ FIG. 1.

The photograph was reproduced reversely in black and white to  obtain a clear image. ity and  that  the isoelectric point of the enzyme was 3.0. The results of amino acid analysis of bromoperoxidase are presented in Table I. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was characterized by the predominance of the acidic amino acids over the basic residues. This resulted in the low PI value (3.0) of the enzyme. The  subunit molecular weight of the enzyme, based on its amino acid composition, could be calculated to be  62,122. The value of the subunit molecular weight of the enzyme was coincident with that (64,000) obtained on SDS-polyacrylam-ide slab gel electrophoresis. This observation, together with the absence of the periodic acid oxidation-Schiff staining on polyacrylamide, which contained 40  pg  of the enzyme, led us to  the conclusion that bromoperoxidase of C. pilulifera con-tained  no  carbohydrate residues. Enzymatic Reaction and Kinetic Properties-The enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of bromide ions  with  subsequent  car-bon-bromine bond formation of monochlorodimedone. The specific activity of the purified bromoperoxidase was 26.3 pmol/min/mg of protein. The omission of hydrogen peroxide or bromide ions  in the complete reaction mixture gave rise to no reaction. The apparent K,,, values for bromide ions and hydrogen peroxide of the enzyme were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The K,,, value for bromide ion  was 1.1 X lo-' M. The plot data of bromide ions was linear over a range of concentration between 2.5 and 400 mM (Fig. 3a). The appar-ent K,,, value for hydrogen peroxide was 9.2 x M, and an inhibition by hydrogen peroxide was observed at concentra-tions higher than 5.0 mM (Fig.  3b). Halide Zon Specificity-Halide ion specificity of the enzyme for F-, C1-, and Br-was examined by the monochlorodime-done assay method and  that for I-was  by the formation of I*. The purified enzyme was specific for Br-and I-, and the enzyme did not act on C1-and F-.

The reactions were done at 25 \"C in the reaction mixture containing 54 ng of the enzyme, 60 nmol of monochlorodimedone, 100 pmol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and varying amounts of potassium bromide and 2 pmol of hydrogen peroxide (a ) ,  or varying amounts of hydrogen peroxide and 20 pmol of potassium bromide (b) as indicated, in a total volume of  1.0 ml. with those previously obtained for other coralline algal sam-ples (27). Peroxidase and Catalase Activities-The peroxidase activity of the enzyme was determined by the o-dianisidine method at pH 6.0. In  the absence of halide ions, bromoperoxidase slightly catalyzed the oxidation of o-dianisidine. One unit of bromo-peroxidase exhibited only 0.0036 unit of peroxidase activity. This result was also confirmed by the finding that no color development was observed on gel stained for peroxidase activ-ity using pyrogallol as  a  substrate  without halide ions (1). The enzyme lacked catalase activity as assessed by mea-surement at three different concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 mM H202 varying the enzyme from 0.5 to 2.0 units/ml of reaction mixture at  pH 6.0. Effect of pH and Temperature-The effect of pH on the activity of the purified enzyme was measured in  the following buffer (final concentration of 0.1 M): citric acid-KzHPOr buffer (pH 3.0-5.5), potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5-8.0), and Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.0-10.0). The enzyme showed the maximum activity at pH 6.0. The pH stability of the enzyme was also measured by incubation for 2  h at 25 \"C in the following buffer (final  concentration of  0.1 M): citric acid-KzHP04 (pH 3.0-5.5), potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5-8.0), Tris-glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0-11.0), and  KzHP04-NaOH buffer (pH 11.0-12.0). The enzyme was stable in a pH range from 5 to 11 and retained 90% of the initial activity after  incubation even at  pH 12.0, but  the enzyme rapidly lost its activity below pH 4.0. The activity of the enzyme was measured at various tem-peratures from 20 to 60 \"C. The enzyme exhibited the maxi-mum activity at approximately 60  \"C. When the enzyme  was incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at various temperatures for 20 min, it exhibited the following activities: 45 \"C, 93%; 50 \"C, 80%; 55 \"C, 68%; 60 \"C, 54%; 65 \"C, 4%. Inhibitors-The effect of various compounds on the bro-moperoxidase reaction was examined by adding each com-pound to  the reaction mixture (Table 11, A). Metal ions tested here showed no influence on the enzyme activity. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by potassium cyanide, P-mercaptoeth-anol, dithiothreitol, hydroxylamine, and hydrazine. Sodium azide and potassium fluoride were also inhibitory to the enzyme reaction. However, when the enzyme was assayed after preincubation with these compounds at 25 \"C and  pH 7.0 for 10 min, the inhibitors of P-mercaptoethanol, dithio-threitol, hydroxylamine, and sodium azide were not observed (Table 11, B). Therefore, the inhibitions of these compounds appeared to be reversible and  not due to damage of the enzyme protein or active site. The effect of fluoride ions on the kinetics of the bromina-tion of monochlorodimedone was examined in detail (Fig. 4). The kinetic data indicated that  the inhibition of fluoride ions was definitely uncompetitive over the range of concentration between 1.25 and 5.0 mM. The K; value of fluoride ions was calculated to be 2.6 x M from the plot data. Chloride ions (final concentrations of 10 and 20 mM) did not affect the enzyme reaction. Absorption  Spectra-As described in  the previous paper (l), a  concentrated solution of the purified bromoperoxidase was a light brown with an absorption peak at 277 nm  and broad and weak absorption bands between 390 and 700 nm. In addition, no significant absorption bands corresponding to heme or flavin were observed in  the spectrum.

These results indicate that bromoperoxidase of C. pilulifera is completely different from reported haloperoxidases, which are hemopro-teins. Prosthetic Group-To confirm that the enzyme is not a hemoprotein, the enzyme solution was treated with HCl-methylethylketone for extrication of heme  by the method of Teale (41). Then  the absorption  spectra of the ketoic layer was measured, but no heme was detected. Analysis of flavin was also performed fluorometrically to ensure that  the enzyme contained no flavin compounds such as  FMN  and FAD. Qualitative analysis of metals  in the concentrated enzyme solutions was done with an argon plasma emission spectros-copy. Fig. 5 showed that the enzyme contained iron and magnesium. Other metals such as vanadium, calcium, sele-nium, molybdenum, and copper were not observed. Plasma emission spectroscopy of three enzyme preparations (0.91, 1.50, and 2.10 mg of protein/ml) revealed that the enzyme had 2.3 & 0.2 atoms of iron  and 1.6 f 0.1 atoms of magnesium/molecule of the enzyme. Exhaustive dialysis of the enzyme samples against the buffer containing 1 mM EDTA or o-phenanthroline did not affect the metal contents or enzyme activities. Therefore, iron and magnesium are considered to  tightly  bind to  the polypeptide residues of the enzyme. Analysis of the enzyme for acid-labile sulfide revealed that the enzyme contained no labile sulfur atom. This suggested that  the nonheme iron  center of the enzyme differs from the [4Fe-4S] or [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is well known for non-heme iron proteins (42,  43). The above data led us to  the conclusion that bromoperoxi-dase from C. pilulifera is a new type of peroxidase. DISCUSSION Coralline algae are characterized by the precipitation of inorganic calcium carbonate  in  their bodies. These algae are found at  the seashores throughout the world, and C. pilulifera is found in all coastal areas in Japan. As described in  the previous paper  (27), the algae including Corallina, Amphiroa, Bossiella, Calliarthron, and Alatocradia which belong to Cor-allinaceae exhibited high bromoperoxidase activities. The physiological function of the enzyme in  these algae is  not yet known, but  the enzyme appears to participate  in  syntheses of L I I I I I I I I I I 1 1 1 1 330 310  290 270 250 3210 190 Wavelength (rm) FIG. 5.

The spectra were scanned from 400 to 190 nm at  the speed of 25 nm/min, but  the unnecessary parts of the spectra were omitted. antimicrobial organic compounds such as bromophenols. In our laboratory, experiments were carried out using the  en-zymes of C. pilulifera and Amphiroa  ephedraea to demonstrate the formation of bromophenols from phenol derivatives (27). The purification of the enzyme from the crude extract of C. pilulifera by the combinations of anion exchange chroma-tography and gel filtration (1) was successful because of the enzyme's high molecular weight and low PI value. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme  was approxi-mately 790,000 by the ultracentrifugal sedimentation equilib-rium method. This value seems reasonable, judging from the subunit molecular weight of 64,000 (SDS-gel electrophoresis) or 62,122 (amino acid composition) and  the dodecad aggregate image of the enzyme by electron microscope analysis. The molecular weight of 880,000 estimated by the  HPLC method appears to be somewhat high. The molecular shapes of dode-cad aggregate of two hexagons face to face are similar to those of hemoglobins in earthworms (44,45). From the image B of Fig. 2a, one hexagon probably faces the other hexagon at a rotation angle of 30\" perpendicular to  the axis of the two hexagons. The subunit molecules are packed together as closely as  their geometry allows, as  illustrated  in Fig. 2b. The bromoperoxidase of C. pilulifera is characterized by its high molecular weight, whereas previously reported haloperoxi-dases and peroxidases have much lower  molecular weight, e.g. 40,000 (monomer) of horseradish peroxidase, 48,000 of bro-moperoxidase from Penicillus  lamourouxii, 60,000 of bromo-peroxidase from Rhipocephalus  phoenix (12), and 42,000 (monomer) of chloroperoxidase of C. fumago (17). van PBe and Lingens (16) reported that  the procaryotic bromoperoxi-dase from P. aureofaciens is a dimeric enzyme with a molecular weight of 155,000-158,000. The optimum pH of the enzyme was 6.0; however, the other marine algal bromoperoxidases from Penicillus  capitatus, P. Nonheme  Type Bromoperoxidase of Corullinu  pilulifera 5199 lamourouxii, R. phoenix, and Rhodomela larix exhibit the maximum activities at a more acidic region of pH 4.0-4.5 (12, 13). One marked property of the enzyme was the high stability in alkaline pH region. However, the enzyme was unstable under acidic conditions (below pH 4.0). The predominance of glutamic acid and  aspartic acid over basic residues in  the amino acid composition of the enzyme was similar to  that found in horseradish peroxidase, chloro-peroxidase of C. fumago (17), and bromoperoxidase of P. capitatus (14). Many peroxidases and chloroperoxidase of C. fumago (17)  are known to contain  substantial levels of car-bohydrate, but  the enzyme had no carbohydrate residues. Manthey et al. (14) described that bromoperoxidase of P. capitatus could not be used to detect the  substrate saturation with bromide ions at very high concentrations because of its low affinity toward bromide ion. However, the enzyme of C. pilulifera showed an apparent K, value of 1.1 X lo-' M for bromide ions, and  this value was similar to  that of chloroper-oxidase of C. fumago for chloride ions (2.8 X lo-' M) (18). Affinity of the enzyme toward hydrogen peroxide was very strong, and the K, value was 9.2 x M. This value was much lower than that of chloroperoxidase (7.9 X M). The enzyme exhibited constant activity in  a wide range of hydro-gen peroxide concentrations from 0.5 to 5.0 mM (Fig. 3b). While the other algal bromoperoxidases have lower optimum hydrogen peroxide concentrations, i.e. 0.25 mM for R. phoenix and 0.125 mM for P. capitatus (12), the enzyme of C. pilulifera seemed to possess a high resistance to  the inhibitory effect of hydrogen peroxide. Sulfhydryl compounds like P-mercaptoethanol and dithio-threitol serve as  an inhibitor of halogenation reaction of the enzyme of C. pilulifera. On the other  hand, the reactions of chloroperoxidase of C. fumago are  inhibited by several anti-thyroid agents such as thiouracil and thiourea (46). The enzyme of C. fumago acts on these compounds to yield the disulfide. These products may arise via intervention of a sulfenyl halide (\"SX, X:halide) (46). Therefore, the inhibi-tion mechanism of the enzyme reactions of C. pilulifera by these sulfhydryl compounds seems to be identical to  that of the enzyme of C. fumago by antithyroid agents. The inhibition of enzymatic halogenation by fluoride ion was not competitive with the halide ion substrate at  the active sites. Fluoride ion may bind to  the enzyme-bromide-hydrogen peroxide complex. Compared with the haloperoxidases of other origins (14, 47), the enzyme of C. pilulifera exhibited much lower peroxi-dase activity  and  no  catalase activity itself in  the absence of halide ions. van P6e and Lingens (16) reported that procar-yotic bromoperoxidase of P. auerofaciens has high catalase activity as well as peroxidase activity  and low halogenating activity. This marked difference between the enzyme of C. pilulifera and  other haloperoxidases appears to be due to  the differences in the catalytic  site, that is the enzyme contains nonheme iron and  other haloperoxidases possess heme irons as  a  prosthetic group. The light brown of the concentrated enzyme solution was considered to be due to  the ferric ions (Fe3+) bound to  the polypeptide residues of the enzyme. The bromoperoxidase of C. pilulifera catalyzes the bromination of phenol to yield 2,4,6-tribromophenol (27). Thus, the active species of bromination reaction is an electrophile of the bromonium cation  (Br+),  not a radical. The ferric ion of the enzyme is probably involved in  the oxidoreduction of halide ion and hydrogen peroxide. The reason why the enzyme of C. pilulifera contained only 2.3 f 0.2 iron atoms/molecule of dodecameric enzyme was not clear. However, the similar phenomena are observed in most peroxidases and also bromoperoxidase (16). Since the enzyme contained no acid-labile sulfide, iron atoms probably bind to the cysteine or tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Circular dichroism spectra of the enzyme also support our investiga-tions.' Further  studies  are in progress to detect the active site constitution of the enzyme. The role of magnesium of the enzyme is obscure. We speculate that magnesium ions bind to carboxylic residues of the enzyme and contribute to  the conformational stabilization of the enzyme. Recently, Haschke et al. (48) reported that calcium ions are needed for the conformational maintenance of horseradish peroxidase. The haloperoxidases of C. fumago, P. aureofaciens, and some marine algae including Penicillus and Rhodomela may have  evolved  from classical peroxidases or catalase. However, judging from the above results, it seems that  the enzyme of C. pilulifera evolved from a different type of enzyme. We propose a classification of haloperoxidases into two  groups; one is a heme type (H type) and  the other is a nonheme type (NH type) haloperoxidase. Our results provide new informa-tion on bromoperoxidase as well as on the classification of peroxidases. The immunochemical property, substrate speci-ficity, stereospecificity, and reaction mechanism of the en-zyme  will be reported elsewhere.

        "Bromoperoxidase was purified from the crude ex-tract of Corallina pilulifera to  be  homogeneous  upon polyacrylamide disc gel and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses according to the procedures previously reported (Itoh, N., Izumi, Y., and  Yamada, H. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com-mun. 13 1, 428-435). The enzyme had a molecular weight  of  approximately 790,000 and was composed of 12 subunits of identical molecular weights (Mr 64,000). Hexagonal molecular shapes of the enzyme were  observed  by  electron  microscopy.  The  isoelectric point  of  the  enzyme was 3.0, and  the  predominance  of acidic  amino  acids was revealed by  amino  acid analysis of  the  enzyme.  The  enzyme was specific  for  I-and  Br-and inactive toward C1-and F-. The optimum pH of the  enzyme was 6.0, and  the  enzyme was stable  in  a range  from pH 5.0 to 11.0. The  enzyme  had  no  heme-or flavin-like compounds as a  prosthetic  group.  Plasma emission  spectroscopy revealed that  the  enzyme  con-tains 2.3 f 0.2 atoms  of  iron  and 1.6 2 0.1 atoms of magnesium/molecule of protein.  Hence,  bromoperoxi-dase  of C. pilulifera was distinct  from  other  haloperox-idases  and  many  peroxidases,  which  are  hemoproteins.",
        "A diversity of peroxidases, which catalyze the peroxidative oxidation of many compounds, has been reported in  animal and plant tissues and microorganisms. Until now, various types of peroxidases including NAD+ peroxidase (2), NADP+ peroxidase (3), fatty acid peroxidase (4), cytochrome peroxi-dase (5,6), catalase  (7), peroxidase (8),  glutathione peroxidase (9, lo), iodoperoxidase (11), bromoperoxidase (12-16), and chloroperoxidase (17-19) have been investigated. Among them, haloperoxidases are very interesting enzymes that  in-troduce the halogen-carbon bond in many organic compounds (20). Haloperoxidases are divided into  three groups according to  the specificity for the halide ion: chloroperoxidase, brom-operoxidase, and iodoperoxidase.",
        "Chloroperoxidase, which was found in Caldariomyces fu-mago by Hager and co-workers (17,18),  has been well studied. The enzyme catalyzes the chlorination, bromination, and iodination of various compounds through electrophilic substi-tution  (19,21)  andaddition mechanism (22,23). We also have studied the specificity, stereoselectivity, and reaction mecha-nism of the chloroperoxidase reaction using trans-cinnamic acid substrates (24). Myeloperoxidase can also catalyze the oxidation of all halide ions except F-(25).",

The enzyme is con-sidered to participate in the synthesis of halocompounds in the marine environment  (13,26). Neidleman and Geigert (25) reported that lactoperoxidase catalyzes the bromination re-action. van P6e and Lingens detected bromoperoxidase activ-ity in the chloramphenicol-producing actinomycete, Strepto-myces  phueochromogenes (15),  and  they purified the enzyme from Pseudomonas  aureofaciens (16).",

        "The above haloperoxidases and peroxidases are  all heme-containing enzymes except NAD+ and NADP+ peroxidases, glutathione peroxidase, and  fatty acid peroxidase. NAD+ per-oxidase possesses FAD as  a  prosthetic group (2),  and gluta-thione peroxidase contains four selenium atoms/molecule of the enzyme (10). The detailed properties of NADP+ peroxi-dase and  fatty acid peroxidase have not been investigated.",
        "In  the previous study, we found that coralline alga contains a large amount of bromoperoxidase and demonstrated the bromination of phenol derivatives such as phenol and o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol with the enzyme (27). We also estab-lished the purification procedures for the enzyme from Cor-allinapilulifera and found that  the enzyme contains no heme-like compound as a  prosthetic group (1).

On SDS-slab gel electrophoresis, a single band of the enzyme  was observed, and  the subunit molecular weight of the enzyme  was  64,000  from the calibration curve of the reference proteins (Fig. 1).

In image A, the enzyme appears to be hexagonal with a symmetry axis (15-16 nm). Image B, which shows a cleavage line bisecting the rectangular figures (10-11 X 15-16 nm), may represent a view perpendicular to the symmetry axis.

        "The purification of the enzyme from the crude extract of C. pilulifera by the combinations of anion exchange chroma-tography and gel filtration (1) was successful because of the enzyme's high molecular weight and low PI value.",
        "The molecular weight of the purified enzyme  was approxi-mately 790,000 by the ultracentrifugal sedimentation equilib-rium method. This value seems reasonable, judging from the subunit molecular weight of 64,000 (SDS-gel electrophoresis) or 62,122 (amino acid composition) and  the dodecad aggregate image of the enzyme by electron microscope analysis. The molecular weight of 880,000 estimated by the  HPLC method appears to be somewhat high. The molecular shapes of dode-cad aggregate of two hexagons face to face are similar to those of hemoglobins in earthworms (44,45). From the image B of Fig. 2a, one hexagon probably faces the other hexagon at a rotation angle of 30\" perpendicular to  the axis of the two hexagons. The subunit molecules are packed together as closely as  their geometry allows, as  illustrated  in Fig. 2b. The bromoperoxidase of C. pilulifera is characterized by its high molecular weight, whereas previously reported haloperoxi-dases and peroxidases have much lower  molecular weight, e.g. 40,000 (monomer) of horseradish peroxidase, 48,000 of bro-moperoxidase from Penicillus  lamourouxii, 60,000 of bromo-peroxidase from Rhipocephalus  phoenix (12), and 42,000 (monomer) of chloroperoxidase of C. fumago (17). van PBe and Lingens (16) reported that  the procaryotic bromoperoxi-dase from P. aureofaciens is a dimeric enzyme with a molecular weight of 155,000-158,000.",

        "The predominance of glutamic acid and  aspartic acid over basic residues in  the amino acid composition of the enzyme was similar to  that found in horseradish peroxidase, chloro-peroxidase of C. fumago (17), and bromoperoxidase of P. capitatus (14). Many peroxidases and chloroperoxidase of C. fumago (17)  are known to contain  substantial levels of car-bohydrate, but  the enzyme had no carbohydrate residues.",
        "Manthey et al. (14) described that bromoperoxidase of P. capitatus could not be used to detect the  substrate saturation with bromide ions at very high concentrations because of its low affinity toward bromide ion. However, the enzyme of C. pilulifera showed an apparent K, value of 1.1 X lo-' M for bromide ions, and  this value was similar to  that of chloroper-oxidase of C. fumago for chloride ions (2.8 X lo-' M) (18). Affinity of the enzyme toward hydrogen peroxide was very strong, and the K, value was 9.2 x M. This value was much lower than that of chloroperoxidase (7.9 X M). The enzyme exhibited constant activity in  a wide range of hydro-gen peroxide concentrations from 0.5 to 5.0 mM (Fig. 3b). While the other algal bromoperoxidases have lower optimum hydrogen peroxide concentrations, i.e. 0.25 mM for R. phoenix and 0.125 mM for P. capitatus (12), the enzyme of C. pilulifera seemed to possess a high resistance to  the inhibitory effect of hydrogen peroxide.",
        "Sulfhydryl compounds like P-mercaptoethanol and dithio-threitol serve as  an inhibitor of halogenation reaction of the enzyme of C. pilulifera. On the other  hand, the reactions of chloroperoxidase of C. fumago are  inhibited by several anti-thyroid agents such as thiouracil and thiourea (46). The enzyme of C. fumago acts on these compounds to yield the disulfide. These products may arise via intervention of a sulfenyl halide (\"SX, X:halide) (46). Therefore, the inhibi-tion mechanism of the enzyme reactions of C. pilulifera by these sulfhydryl compounds seems to be identical to  that of the enzyme of C. fumago by antithyroid agents.",
        "The inhibition of enzymatic halogenation by fluoride ion was not competitive with the halide ion substrate at  the active sites. Fluoride ion may bind to  the enzyme-bromide-hydrogen peroxide complex.",
        "Compared with the haloperoxidases of other origins (14, 47), the enzyme of C. pilulifera exhibited much lower peroxi-dase activity  and  no  catalase activity itself in  the absence of halide ions. van P6e and Lingens (16) reported that procar-yotic bromoperoxidase of P. auerofaciens has high catalase activity as well as peroxidase activity  and low halogenating activity. This marked difference between the enzyme of C. pilulifera and  other haloperoxidases appears to be due to  the differences in the catalytic  site, that is the enzyme contains nonheme iron and  other haloperoxidases possess heme irons as  a  prosthetic group.",
        "The light brown of the concentrated enzyme solution was considered to be due to  the ferric ions (Fe3+) bound to  the polypeptide residues of the enzyme. The bromoperoxidase of C. pilulifera catalyzes the bromination of phenol to yield 2,4,6-tribromophenol (27). Thus, the active species of bromination reaction is an electrophile of the bromonium cation  (Br+),  not a radical. The ferric ion of the enzyme is probably involved in  the oxidoreduction of halide ion and hydrogen peroxide. The reason why the enzyme of C. pilulifera contained only 2.3 f 0.2 iron atoms/molecule of dodecameric enzyme was not clear. However, the similar phenomena are observed in most peroxidases and also bromoperoxidase (16). Since the enzyme contained no acid-labile sulfide, iron atoms probably bind to the cysteine or tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Circular dichroism spectra of the enzyme also support our investiga-tions.' Further  studies  are in progress to detect the active site constitution of the enzyme.",
        "The role of magnesium of the enzyme is obscure. We speculate that magnesium ions bind to carboxylic residues of the enzyme and contribute to  the conformational stabilization of the enzyme. Recently, Haschke et al. (48) reported that calcium ions are needed for the conformational maintenance of horseradish peroxidase.",
        "The haloperoxidases of C. fumago, P. aureofaciens, and some marine algae including Penicillus and Rhodomela may have  evolved  from classical peroxidases or catalase. However, judging from the above results, it seems that  the enzyme of C. pilulifera evolved from a different type of enzyme. We propose a classification of haloperoxidases into two  groups; one is a heme type (H type) and  the other is a nonheme type (NH type) haloperoxidase. Our results provide new informa-tion on bromoperoxidase as well as on the classification of peroxidases. The immunochemical property, substrate speci-ficity, stereospecificity, and reaction mechanism of the en-zyme  will be reported elsewhere.",
