The initial steps of the halogenase reaction\u2014combination of the enzyme\u2019s iron(II) cofactor with 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and O2 to produce CO2, succinate and an iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate that abstracts a hydrogen atom (H\u2022) from the substrate5,11\u2014are con-served with respect to those of the more extensively studied Fe/2OG hydroxylases12\u201315. The two reactions diverge in the fate of the result-ing substrate (carbon) radical (C\u2022), which can couple either with the hydroxo (OH) ligand of the Fe(III)-OH intermediate produced by the H-abstraction step or, in the halogenases, with a cis-coordinated chloride or bromide ligand. The key structural feature that enables this alternative radical coupling is an abbreviated protein ligand set comprising a pair of histidine residues16,17. Whereas the hydroxy-lases have, additionally, a carboxylate ligand from an aspartate or glutamate residue to complete the 2-His\u20131-carboxylate facial triad18, the halogenases have a glycine or alanine residue at the correspond-ing sequence position16. The effective carboxylate deletion vacates an iron-coordination site that accommodates the halide ligand, which is ultimately transferred as a radical to the substrate C in the final step of the reaction. Elucidation of this underlying mechanistic strategy raised the question of how these enzymes direct coupling of the substrate radical with the halogen while avoiding the transfer of the OH ligand that prevails in the related hydroxylases.SyrB2 from Pseudomonas syringae, the founding member of the Fe/2OG halogenase subclass3, chlorinates L-threonine covalently tethered as a thioester to the phosphopantetheine arm of its carrier protein, SyrB1, and has served as the primary subject for mecha-nistic analysis11,19\u201321. Comparison of SyrB2 reactions with the native L-threoninyl-SyrB1 substrate to its reactions with analogs that pres-ent different amino acids implies that positioning of the substrate far from the oxygen ligand and closer to the halogen is the primary structural feature ensuring selective halogenation19. These studies reveal a strong inverse correlation between the halogenation selec-tivity and the rate of (H\u2022) abstraction, with ferryl decay ~130 times slower with the primarily chlorinated native substrate than with an analog designed to project the target carbon closer to the Fe(IV)=O intermediate that is primarily hydroxylated11,19. Pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments verified the expected trend in substrate positioning relative to an EPR active iron-nitrosyl cofactor designed to mimic reaction intermediates21. Although this study provided mechanistically relevant structural data, and several computational studies have afforded global but speculative struc-tural models for the SyrB2 complex with its substrates20,22\u201324, no high-resolution experimental structure of the O2-reactive complex of any Fe/2OG halogenase has yet been reported.The recently discovered halogenase WelO5 chlorinates C13 of 12-epi-fischerindole U (1) to yield 12-epi-fischerindole G (2) (Fig. 1a)25,26. This enzymatic transformation constitutes the first step in the oxidative maturation of 1 to welwitindolinones in the stigonematalean cyanobacterium Hapalosiphon welwischii UTEX B1830. As the first example of an Fe/2OG halogenase that acts on a free, small-molecule substrate, the enzyme obviates the barrier to structural characterization imposed by the hydrolytically labile aminoacyl\u2013carrier protein substrates of other halogenases. Here we report a series of X-ray crystal structures of WelO5. In these structures, we found the C13 chlorination target of 1 oriented away from the halogen ligand and proximal to the predicted location of the oxo group in the Fe(IV)=O intermediate. Because the sub-strate resides far from the oxygen ligand in the reactive haloferryl state, ligand rearrangement must occur during the catalytic cycle, promoted by a distinctive co-substrate conformation and second-sphere hydrogen-bonding group.RESULTS X-ray crystal structure of apo WelO5WelO5 was crystallized anaerobically with Fe(II) and its 2OG co-substrate, initially in the absence of 1 (Fig. 1b). Although WelO5 is a monomer in solution (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1), the X-ray structure, solved at 2.0-\u00c5 reso-lution by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods (Supplementary Table 1), contains three WelO5 molecules in the asymmetric unit (ASU), all of which adopt the eight-stranded \u03b2-sandwich topology (Fig. 1c) characteristic of Fe/2OG enzymes27.

Prior study of related halogenases forecasts substrate hydroxylation in this active-site configuration, but X-ray crystallographic verification of C13 halogenation in single crystals mandates that ligand dynamics must reposition the oxygen ligand to enable the observed outcome. S189A WelO5 produces a mixture of halogenation and hydroxylation products, showing that an outer-sphere hydrogen-bonding group orches-trates ligand movements to achieve a configuration that promotes halogen transfer. np g \u00a9  201 6 N at ur e A m er ic a,  Inc.

WelO5 contains a glycine (Gly166) at the sequence position that would provide the aspartate or glutamate ligand in standard Fe/2OG hydroxylases. The struc-ture confirmed that WelO5 does not supply a coordinating carboxy-late from an alternative sequence position and that the absence of a carboxylate side chain allows for direct coordination of a chloride ion, consistent with use of the same underlying mechanistic strategy as the carrier-protein-dependent Fe/2OG halogenases16.X-ray crystal structure of substrate-bound WelO5A soak of 1 into apo Fe(II)\u20132OG\u2013WelO5 crystals yielded a 2.4-\u00c5-resolution structure of the enzyme\u2013substrate complex (Supplementary Table 2). Clear electron density for the substrate is observed in one molecule of the ASU, with a lesser degree of occupancy in the other two monomers (Supplementary Fig. 3). The isocyanide and tertiary isoprenoid substituents are readily discerned (Fig. 2a), allowing for unequivocal orientation of the substrate in the WelO5 active site. The binding pocket is predomi-nantly hydrophobic (Supplementary Fig. 4), in keeping with the large and hydrophobic nature of the substrate, but two regions of the enzyme undergo conformational change to contribute key hydrogen-bonding contacts to the indole nitrogen and isocyanide moieties of 1 (Fig. 2b). The WelO5 active site is embedded between the two \u03b2-sheets that constitute the core fold and flanked by connecting loop structures. A short loop (residues 75\u201382) in WelO5 shifts 3.4 \u00c5 to allow the backbone amide nitrogen of Ala82 to engage in an unusual carbon-mediated hydrogen bond with the isocyanide moi-ety of 1 (Fig. 2b). Another connecting segment near the active site (Fig. 1c) forms an \u03b1-helical structure that sits ajar from the rest of the protein in the absence of substrate. The open position of this external helix in the apo structure exposes the active site to solvent (Supplementary Fig. 5), a feature that is distinct to WelO5 among structurally characterized Fe/2OG halogenases (Supplementary Fig. 6)16,17,28. Upon binding of 1, the external helix shifts 9 \u00c5 to close over the active site (Supplementary Fig. 7a), locked in place by hydrophobic interactions with the core fold and an extended hydrogen-bonding network that involves side chain and backbone atoms immediately downstream of the H-X-G sequence in the active site (Supplementary Fig. 7b). This observation, coupled with the fact that this segment of the protein diverges most in sequence from the equivalent region in the known WelO5 homolog AmbO5 (Supplementary Fig. 8)29,30, suggests that the external helix may dictate substrate preference. Closure of the motif is observed in the single WelO5 molecule in the ASU that displays full occupancy of 1. Lattice interactions with adjacent symmetry mates preclude move-ment in the other two monomers (Supplementary Fig. 3), provid-ing a rationale for diminished substrate occupancy in those chains. The chlorination target, C13, of 1 is just 4.5 \u00c5 from the Fe(II) center, closest to the cofactor among all its carbon atoms. The pro-R hydro-gen of C13 is directed toward the Fe(II) (Fig. 3a), consistent with the known stereoselectivity of the reaction25. Surprisingly, C13 is farther from the chlorine ligand, 5.7 \u00c5 away (Fig. 3a). Assuming that the oxo\u2013hydroxo ligand of the Fe(IV)=O/Fe(III)-OH unit would occupy the open coordination position axial to His259, the binding site is typical of Fe/2OG hydroxylases (Supplementary Figs. 9\u201311). Crystal structure and activity of the g166D WelO5 variantFrom the crystallographic data, the active site of wild-type (WT) WelO5, when poised for O2 activation, appeared primed to hydroxy-late the substrate. In support of this observation, G166 \u2192 Asp sub-stitution in WelO5 results in exclusive hydroxylation of  1 to give 3 (13R-hydroxyl-12-epi-fischerindole U; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Figs. 12\u201316). Interestingly, when we performed this analysis with WT WelO5, we observed trace amounts of 3 (<2% of  2) (Supplementary Fig. 17), consistent with the reactivity patterns of carrier-protein-dependent halogenases19. A 2.5-\u00c5-resolution structure of G166D WelO5 in complex with 1 shows that Asp166 coordinates Fe(II) and the substrate location observed in WT WelO5 is retained in the vari-ant enzyme (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 18).bromination by WT WelO5 in single crystalsTo confirm that the substrate-binding site observed in the WT enzyme is also competent for halogenation, we repeated the soak of 1 into WT WelO5 co-crystallized with NaBr31. Collection of X-ray diffraction data sets at the Br\u2013K edge (13. 5 keV) (Supplementary Table 3) in anaerobic crystals and those exposed to O2 allowed for 638  nature chemical biology | vol 12 | august 2016 | www.nature.com/naturechemicalbiologyarticle NATURE ChEmICAL bIOLOgy doi: 10.1038/nchembio.2112analog instead adds in the open coordination position in this sys-tem, trans to the distal histidine ligand, without accompanying rear-rangement of 2OG.Inspection of the structure of WelO5 revealed a distinctive hydrogen-bonding group in the Fe(II) secondary sphere, potentially positioned appropriately to promote ligand dynamics (Fig. 4a, top pathway, in black). Ser189 is located near the C1 carboxylate of 2OG and the coordinated halogen ligand, within hydrogen bonding distance of the former ligand (Fig. 4a\u2013c). In this position, Ser189 could interact directly with the oxygenic ligand in the peroxysuc-cinate, Fe(IV)=O and/or Fe(III)-OH states (Fig. 4a, top pathway, and Supplementary Fig. 19)\u2014but only after the proposed ligand rear-rangement has occurred. The hydrogen-bonding capacity of the side chain would constrain the oxygenic group away from C13 so as to suppress hydroxylation and permit transfer of the cis halogen ligand. Consistent with such a role for Ser189, its substitution by alanine relaxes the selectivity of WelO5, resulting in an equal pro-portion of OH (3)-and Cl (2)-modified products (Fig. 4d).DISCUSSION On the basis of proposals for substrate positioning in SyrB219,20, we predicted that the WelO5 target carbon would reside adjacent to the halogen. In other Fe/2OG enzymes, the position occupied by the coordinated water in the Fe(II)2OG complex is presumed to repre-sent the location of the oxo ligand in the Fe(IV)=O intermediate. We thus anticipated a binding site for 1 in the quadrant defined by the open coordination position and the Cl ligand, likely very close to the latter. In many other crystallographically characterized Fe/2OG enzymes, the analogous site, defined by the positions of the water ligand and carboxylate residue in the H-X-D/E motif, is employed for substrate binding (Supplementary Fig. 9)27. In WelO5, this pocket is accessible to solvent and sufficiently large to accommo-date 1 in the more open state of the active site that we observe in the substrate-free structure. But in the substrate-bound protein, the site is definitively occluded by a conformational change in Phe169, and the substrate instead resides in the opposite quadrant, over His164 (Supplementary Fig. 9). The observed location is, however, consis-tent with the endpoint of a proposed substrate-binding channel in SyrB2 (ref. 16) (Supplementary Fig. 10).The experimentally validated substrate-positioning hypothesis put forth for the control of alternative group transfer in carrier-protein dependent halogenases11,19,21 dictates that the target C-H bond be held away from the Fe(IV)=O unit with the bond vectors close to perpendicular to ensure H abstraction through a \u03c0 pathway20,21. To square this requirement with the observed sub-strate-binding site in WelO5, we considered ligand configurations for the haloferryl intermediate state distinct from that implied by the X-ray crystal structure of the reactant complex. Location of the oxo unit in the plane defined by His164, 2OG, and the Cl ligand (Fig. 4a) would reconcile the crystallographically observed location of the substrate in WelO5 and the known reactivity trends in the subfamily of Fe/2OG halogenases as a whole11. Indeed, corresponding geom-etries were recently proposed for the halofer-ryl complex in SyrB2 (refs. 20,21). In one of these analyses20, location of the oxo trans to the His164 equivalent is proposed to occur in the context of a trigonal bipyramidal complex (axial positions defined by the oxo and His164 ligands). In WelO5, such a complex could arise via slight migration of the Cl ligand to bring it closer to C13, perhaps an additional feature that would promote selective halogen transfer. Although that study predicts a simi-lar reactive intermediate structure, it relied entirely on intuition and computational analysis to deduce the disposition of the halogenation target within the active site.One pathway to the proposed intermediate configuration would involve migration of the 2OG C1 carboxylate to the position axial to a 180\u00b0 b Met225 Met221 Ala82 Val81 3.7 \u00c53.5 \u00c5Figure 2 | The substrate-binding site in WelO5.

C1-carboxylate migration to accommodate a distinct oxygen-binding site and oxo location may well be operant in carrier-protein-dependent halogenases and perhaps other Fe/2OG enzymes mediating non-hydroxylation reactions, as observed in NO-bound CAS32.

Migration, instead, of the oxygen-derived moiety in the Fe(II)\u2013peroxysuccinate (Supplementary Fig. 19) or haloferryl state would obviate this clash. The NO-bound structure of WelO5 (Fig. 4b) also dictates that relocation of the oxo unit away from the C13 halogenation tar-get must occur after O2 addition. Importantly, the arrangement is fully distinct from the findings of an analogous experiment in SyrB2 that shows NO already distal to the substrate chlorination site upon formation of the Fe(II)\u20132OG\u2013Cl complex21.WelO5 exhibits another unusual feature that may serve to promote residency of the haloferryl oxo ligand in the position vacated by the departing C1 functional group. Ser189 is located near the carboxylate and halogen, within hydrogen bonding distance of the for-mer ligand (Fig. 4c). A second notable feature is the absence in the active site of a gener-ally conserved positively charged residue27, typically an arginine, and its replacement by Phe276. In other Fe/2OG enzymes, the side chain of this arginine residue is positioned optimally to hydrogen bond with the oxo moiety of the Fe(IV)=O intermediate. Ser189 and, perhaps, the succinate carboxylate ligand could functionally replace the arginine and the protein carboxylate ligand (Supplementary Fig. 20) to direct the oxo of the Fe(IV)=O unit to the position necessary to enable haloge-nation. The observation that S189A WelO5 displays relaxed halogenation selectivity (Fig. 4d) further supports the idea that a second-sphere hydrogen-bonding group can exert catalytic control in this scaffold.The carrier-protein-dependent haloge-nases, as well as other enzymes in the larger Fe/2OG family with non-hydroxylation out-comes (desaturation, oxacyclization, etc.), may employ strategies similar to those pro-posed here for WelO5. Exploitation of the 2OG co-substrate and outer-sphere hydro-gen-bonding groups in the localization of the reactive intermediate distal to the substrate C-H target might, in a more general sense, facilitate reactions that demand suppression of OH transfer. Indeed, the mechanisms of known Fe/2OG enzymes that catalyze non-canonical reactions12, and in particular how they avoid potentially competing hydroxyla-tion outcomes, remain largely unknown. In the few examples characterized, residues in peripheral structural elements and/or the intrinsic properties of the substrate are proposed to impede hydroxylation to allow for a different type of reactivity33. The structure of WelO5 suggests a new and potentially more versatile strategy, relocation of the reac-tive Fe(IV)=O moiety, to promote a different reaction outcome in this scaffold. received 8 December 2015; accepted 12 May 2016;published online 27 June 2016Figure 4 | Proposed mechanism for WelO5-mediated halogenation and its structural basis.

DNA sequencing was performed by Elim BioPharm Inc. Preparative scale reverse-phase analytical and semipreparative HPLC was performed using a Dionex UHPLC with a photo-diode array UV\u2013vis detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). HRMS analysis was conducted using a Q Exactive Benchtop Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Dionex RSLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Conventional low-resolution LC-MS analysis was conducted with a Shimadzu LCMS-2020 system. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV600 (600 MHz) spectrom-eter or a Bruker Avance III 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 1H/13C/15N triple-resonance inverse probe (1.7 mm microprobe).WelO5-G166D, WelO5-S189A and WelO5-G166D-S189A protein purification. Single amino acid variants of WelO5 (G166D or S189A) were generated accord-ing to the protocol described in the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) using plasmid pQTEV::welO5 as the template and the following primer sequences.G166D WelO5.

A double variant of WelO5 (G166D-S189A) was generated using plasmid pQTEV::welO5-G166D as the template and the primers for S189A WelO5 generation following an otherwise identical protocol compared to that described for the single variants. The sequences of transformants were veri-fied by Sanger methods and introduced into C43 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells for overexpression and purification via the procedure described for wild-type (WT) WelO525.WelO5-G166D, WelO5-S189A and WelO5-G166D-S189A in vitro activity assays. Individual assays for each WelO5 variant with 12-epi-fisherindole U (1, isolated from H. welwitschii B1830 as described previously25 and purified to homogeneity) as the substrate were carried out in HEPES buffer (20 mM), pH = 7.4 on a 100-\u03bcL scale containing the following components: enzyme (20 \u03bcM), 1 (500 \u03bcM), 2OG (1 mM), NaCl (2 mM), and (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 (500 \u03bcM). In a typical assay, all components except (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 and the pro-tein were mixed under ambient conditions and then purged with nitrogen gas. Protein samples were mixed with an aliquot of freshly prepared (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 and pre-purged with nitrogen gas, and the resulting solution was incubated briefly (~10 min) under a nitrogen atmosphere followed by purge with air. The samples were incubated under aerobic conditions at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min. The assay was quenched by extraction with ethyl acetate and centrifugation to isolate the supernatant. The extracts were combined, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and redissolved in methanol (50 \u03bcL). A portion of the methanol solution was injected into a Dionex UHPLC over a Kinetex 2.6 \u03bcm XB-C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 150 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex). Analyses were carried out using a 50% acetonitrile/50% water mobile phase under isocratic conditions using a 0.4 mL/min flow rate with monitoring by UV absorption at 278 nm. For accu-rate mass determination of the enzymatic product(s) derived from each assay, the methanol solution was injected to a Dionex RSLC paired with a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Benchtop Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. All analytical-scale assays (100 \u03bcl) were performed in triplicate and representative HPLC traces are shown.Structure determination of WelO5-G166D enzymatic product 3. To deter-mine the structure of the WelO5-G166D enzymatic product 3, the reactions were scaled proportionally to 12 mL from a 100-\u03bcL scale reaction and incu-bated at 30 \u00b0C for 16 h. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (12 mL \u00d7 3), and combined ethyl acetate extracts were dried under nitrogen gas. The crude material was dissolved in methanol and purified by a Dionex HPLC equipped with a Luna 5um C18 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex). The mobile-phase gradient ran from 50\u201380% acetonitrile in water over 35 min at a 1 mL/min flow rate with monitoring by UV absorption at 278 nm. The target peak eluted with a retention time of 11.0 min and was collected and dried. The regiochemistry of the hydroxyl substituent on 3 was determined by analyzing its 1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 12) in comparison with those of 1 and 2 (Supplementary Fig. 15) and its 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 13). The relative stereochemistry of the hydroxyl substit-uent on 3 was determined by analyzing its NOESY spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 14). The spectral data are tabulated in Supplementary Table 4.Purification of WelO5 for crystallographic trials. WelO5 containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was overexpressed and purified by Ni-NTA affin-ity chromatography as described25. To remove metal ions incorporated during overexpression, the protein sample was dialyzed at 4 \u00b0C against 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, followed by two rounds of dialysis in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 to remove EDTA. WelO5 was further purified via anion exchange chromatography using a HiPrep DEAE FF column in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and a gradient of 0\u201350% 1 M NaCl over 10 column volumes. Purified WelO5 eluted at 200 mM NaCl. Size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 pg column (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl) yielded a single monodis-perse peak that elutes as an apparent monomer. Fractions containing WelO5 were pooled, exchanged into 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, and concentrated with an Amicon MWCO 10K centrifugal filter. Samples intended for co-crystallization in the presence of bromide, generated to assign the location of the halogen lig-and via anomalous diffraction methods, were produced as described. LC-MS grade chloride-free water used in all of the chromatography procedures and no further purification was performed after the dialysis step.Crystallization and X-ray structure determination. Purified protein samples were rendered anaerobic by purging for 30 min with argon gas and transferred to an anoxic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products). Protein samples were diluted to 15 mg/mL in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl (or NaBr) and cocrys-tallized with 1 equivalent of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 5 equivalents of 2OG. The samples were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a precipitant solution consisting of 20% PEG 3350, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.5, and 0.1 M Bis-tris pH 5.5. Rod-shaped crystals were obtained in hanging drop vapor diffusion trials within a week of setup. Substrates were incorporated by overlay of crystal drops with 2 \u03bcL of a 2 mM solution of 1 (diluted from a 10 mM stock in DMSO) prepared in the crystallization solution. The soaks were allowed to proceed for 6\u20138 h at room temperature. Crystals were prepared for data collection by mounting on rayon loops after cryoprotection in crystallization solution supplemented with 24% glycerol, followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen for data collection. LC-MS grade water was used to prepare all solutions for bromine co-crystallization experiments. In data sets collected after reaction initiation with O2, the crystal trays were removed from the anaerobic chamber immediately before harvest and exposed to ambient O2 during cryoprotection and harvest. In NO-bound structures, 50\u2013100 \u03bcL of a 64 mM diethylamine NONOate solution prepared in 20 mM NaOH was added to the reservoir solution in the anaerobic chamber before crystal harvest. The well was quickly resealed and, after 30 min incu-bation in the NO-enriched atmosphere, the crystals were harvested and flash frozen as previously described.WelO5 crystallizes in the P212121 space group with three molecules in the asymmetric unit. G166D WelO5 crystals belong to the C2 space group with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit. All crystallographic data sets were collected at beamlines 23ID-D, 23ID-B, and 21ID-F of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab. Resulting diffraction images were processed with the software package HKL2000 (ref. 34). Phase information was obtained using iron single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods. A data set col-lected at 1.74 \u00c5 yielded usable anomalous signal to 3.9 \u00c5 resolution. The pro-gram autoSHARP35 was used to locate three heavy atom sites (phasing power of 0.58) that correspond to the native iron cofactor in each WelO5 monomer in the ASU. Solvent flattening and density modification procedures generated interpretable electron density maps that were subjected to an autobuilding pro-cedure using ARP/wARP36. The initial model was then refined against a native data set collected to 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. All subsequent structures were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER37 with the substrate-free WelO5 model np g \u00a9  201 6 N at ur e A m er ic a,  Inc.

Residues in the 167\u2013176 loop facilitate external-helix closure in the WT enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 8), providing a rationale for failure to observe the conformational change in G166D WelO5, likely a consequence of the disorder in that region. The loop con-taining residues 79\u201382 moves closer to the active site, as observed in WT WelO5 + 1 monomers, even those that fail to undergo lid loop closure due to lattice contacts. Ramachandran and Molprobity analyses indicate 99.5% of the residues in preferred and allowed regions with a clashscore of 2.38 and two rotamer outliers.The 1-/NO-bound WelO5 model consists of residues 11\u2013214, 218\u2013290 in chain A, residues 11\u2013214, 219\u2013290 in chain B, and residues 11\u2013217, 224\u2013290 in chain C. The final model also consists of three Fe(II), three  chlorine atoms, three 2OG molecules, three molecules of 1, two NO molecules, and 190 water molecules. Ramachandran and Molprobity analyses indicate 100% of the resi-dues in preferred and allowed regions with a clashscore of 1.15 and a single rotamer outlier. Compared to the 1-bound WelO5 structure in the absence of NO, more significant occupancy of substrate 1 is observed in all three WelO5 chains. The external helical motif in chains A and B closes over the active site while the active site of chain C remains exposed. The lattice contacts in each chain, as described above, are consistent with the observed trends. Two NO molecules are modeled into the active sites of chains A and B, both of which exhibited strong difference density for the molecule. Chain C displayed much weaker difference density, which we elected to leave unmodeled.34. Otwinowski, Z. & Minor, W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.

Refinement and model building steps were performed with the programs Refmac5 (ref. 38) and COOT39, respectively. Bromine anomalous Fourier maps were generated using data sets collected at 0.92 \u00c5 with the programs CAD and FFT40, both part of the CCP4 software suite41. Coordinates and restraints for 1 were generated with the PRODRG server42. A summary of the processing and refinement statistics for all structures can be found in Supplementary Tables 1\u20133. Ramachandran outlier analysis and other validation procedures were carried out using the Molprobity server43. Figures were generated using the PyMOL molecular graphics software pack-age (Schr\u00f6dinger LLC).In the absence of substrate, the model for each WelO5 molecule in the ASU contains the full sequence of amino acids, apart from an affinity tag and the ten residues at the N terminus of the protein that immediately follow the tag. The model consists of residues 11\u2013290 in chains A and C, residues 10\u2013290 in chain B, three Fe(II) ions, three chlorine atoms, three molecules of 2OG, and 456 water molecules. Ramachandran and Molprobity analyses indicate 100% of the resi-dues in preferred and allowed regions with a clashscore of 0.61 and three rotamer outliers. Soak of WelO5 crystals with 1 yielded electron density for the molecule in all three WelO5 monomers in the ASU (Supplementary Fig. 5), but the molecule was only modeled into two of the active site chains, A and B. Only chain B displays full occupancy of 1, and substrate binding is associated with clear evidence for a conformational change in the external helix motif and rotamer change in the side chain of Phe169. These structural changes are located at the periphery of the protein structure and are not observed in the other two molecules in the ASU due to more extensive engagement of the cor-responding regions in lattice contacts (Supplementary Fig. 3). Irrespective of these peripheral conformational changes, a short loop region in the core fold (residues 79\u201382) containing a motif that interacts with the isocyanide moiety in 1 shifts inwards toward the substrate-binding site in all three molecules, con-sistent with partial occupancy of these sites by 1. In chain B, residues 11\u2013290 can be modeled, although the density for residues 215\u2013219 is weak compared to the surrounding peptide chain. In chain C, residues 11\u2013215 and 220\u2013290 can be modeled. Residues 216\u2013219 are disordered and were not included in the final model. In chain A, residues 10\u2013290 can be modeled but no movement of the external helix is observed, consistent with observation of more extensive lattice contacts in this monomer. The model for substrate-bound WelO5 also contains three Fe(II) ions, three chlorine atoms, three molecules of 2OG, and 251 water molecules. Ramachandran and Molprobity analyses indicate 99.5% of the residues in preferred and allowed regions with a clashscore of 1.44 and no rotamer outliers.The substrate-bound structure of G166D WelO5 exhibits some disorder in the loop region following residue 166 (residues 169\u2013173) as well as in a neighboring region (residues 90\u201397) (Supplementary Fig. 18). Residues 10\u201389, 98\u2013168, and 174\u2013290 are included in the final model in addition to a single Fe(II) ion and 2OG molecule.

        "10.1038/nchembio.2112Oxygen-dependent Fe/2OG halogenases target unactivated sp3-hybridized carbon centers for installation of chlorine or bromine1\u20139, transformations that are of broad synthetic utility10. The initial steps of the halogenase reaction\u2014combination of the enzyme\u2019s iron(II) cofactor with 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and O2 to produce CO2, succinate and an iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate that abstracts a hydrogen atom (H\u2022) from the substrate5,11\u2014are con-served with respect to those of the more extensively studied Fe/2OG hydroxylases12\u201315. The two reactions diverge in the fate of the result-ing substrate (carbon) radical (C\u2022), which can couple either with the hydroxo (OH) ligand of the Fe(III)-OH intermediate produced by the H-abstraction step or, in the halogenases, with a cis-coordinated chloride or bromide ligand. The key structural feature that enables this alternative radical coupling is an abbreviated protein ligand set comprising a pair of histidine residues16,17. Whereas the hydroxy-lases have, additionally, a carboxylate ligand from an aspartate or glutamate residue to complete the 2-His\u20131-carboxylate facial triad18, the halogenases have a glycine or alanine residue at the correspond-ing sequence position16. The effective carboxylate deletion vacates an iron-coordination site that accommodates the halide ligand, which is ultimately transferred as a radical to the substrate C in the final step of the reaction. Elucidation of this underlying mechanistic strategy raised the question of how these enzymes direct coupling of the substrate radical with the halogen while avoiding the transfer of the OH ligand that prevails in the related",
        "hydroxylases.SyrB2 from Pseudomonas syringae, the founding member of the Fe/2OG halogenase subclass3, chlorinates L-threonine covalently tethered as a thioester to the phosphopantetheine arm of its carrier protein, SyrB1, and has served as the primary subject for mecha-nistic analysis11,19\u201321. Comparison of SyrB2 reactions with the native L-threoninyl-SyrB1 substrate to its reactions with analogs that pres-ent different amino acids implies that positioning of the substrate far from the oxygen ligand and closer to the halogen is the primary structural feature ensuring selective halogenation19. These studies reveal a strong inverse correlation between the halogenation selec-tivity and the rate of (H\u2022) abstraction, with ferryl decay ~130 times slower with the primarily chlorinated native substrate than with an analog designed to project the target carbon closer to the Fe(IV)=O intermediate that is primarily hydroxylated11,19. Pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments verified the expected trend in substrate positioning relative to an EPR active iron-nitrosyl cofactor designed to mimic reaction intermediates21. Although this study provided mechanistically relevant structural data, and several computational studies have afforded global but speculative struc-tural models for the SyrB2 complex with its substrates20,22\u201324, no high-resolution experimental structure of the O2-reactive complex of any Fe/2OG halogenase has yet been",

This enzymatic transformation constitutes the first step in the oxidative maturation of 1 to welwitindolinones in the stigonematalean cyanobacterium Hapalosiphon welwischii UTEX B1830. As the first example of an Fe/2OG halogenase that acts on a free, small-molecule substrate, the enzyme obviates the barrier to structural characterization imposed by the hydrolytically labile aminoacyl\u2013carrier protein substrates of other halogenases. Here we report a series of X-ray crystal structures of WelO5. In these structures, we found the C13 chlorination target of 1 oriented away from the halogen ligand and proximal to the predicted location of the oxo group in the Fe(IV)=O intermediate. Because the sub-strate resides far from the oxygen ligand in the reactive haloferryl state, ligand rearrangement must occur during the catalytic cycle, promoted by a distinctive co-substrate conformation and second-sphere hydrogen-bonding",

WelO5 contains a glycine (Gly166) at the sequence position that would provide the aspartate or glutamate ligand in standard Fe/2OG hydroxylases. The struc-ture confirmed that WelO5 does not supply a coordinating carboxy-late from an alternative sequence position and that the absence of a carboxylate side chain allows for direct coordination of a chloride ion, consistent with use of the same underlying mechanistic strategy as the carrier-protein-dependent Fe/2OG",
        "halogenases16.X-ray crystal structure of substrate-bound WelO5A soak of 1 into apo Fe(II)\u20132OG\u2013WelO5 crystals yielded a 2.4-\u00c5-resolution structure of the enzyme\u2013substrate complex (Supplementary Table 2). Clear electron density for the substrate is observed in one molecule of the ASU, with a lesser degree of occupancy in the other two monomers (Supplementary Fig. 3). The isocyanide and tertiary isoprenoid substituents are readily discerned (Fig. 2a), allowing for unequivocal orientation of the substrate in the WelO5 active site. The binding pocket is predomi-nantly hydrophobic (Supplementary Fig. 4), in keeping with the large and hydrophobic nature of the substrate, but two regions of the enzyme undergo conformational change to contribute key hydrogen-bonding contacts to the indole nitrogen and isocyanide moieties of 1 (Fig. 2b). The WelO5 active site is embedded between the two \u03b2-sheets that constitute the core fold and flanked by connecting loop structures. A short loop (residues 75\u201382) in WelO5 shifts 3.4 \u00c5 to allow the backbone amide nitrogen of Ala82 to engage in an unusual carbon-mediated hydrogen bond with the isocyanide moi-ety of 1 (Fig. 2b). Another connecting segment near the active site (Fig. 1c) forms an \u03b1-helical structure that sits ajar from the rest of the protein in the absence of substrate. The open position of this external helix in the apo structure exposes the active site to solvent (Supplementary Fig. 5), a feature that is distinct to WelO5 among structurally characterized Fe/2OG halogenases (Supplementary Fig. 6)16,17,28. Upon binding of 1, the external helix shifts 9 \u00c5 to close over the active site (Supplementary Fig. 7a), locked in place by hydrophobic interactions with the core fold and an extended hydrogen-bonding network that involves side chain and backbone atoms immediately downstream of the H-X-G sequence in the active site (Supplementary Fig. 7b). This observation, coupled with the fact that this segment of the protein diverges most in sequence from the equivalent region in the known WelO5 homolog AmbO5 (Supplementary Fig. 8)29,30, suggests that the external helix may dictate substrate preference. Closure of the motif is observed in the single WelO5 molecule in the ASU that displays full occupancy of 1. Lattice interactions with adjacent symmetry mates preclude move-ment in the other two monomers (Supplementary Fig. 3), provid-ing a rationale for diminished substrate occupancy in those chains. The chlorination target, C13, of 1 is just 4.5 \u00c5 from the Fe(II) center, closest to the cofactor among all its carbon atoms. The pro-R hydro-gen of C13 is directed toward the Fe(II) (Fig. 3a), consistent with the known stereoselectivity of the reaction25. Surprisingly, C13 is farther from the chlorine ligand, 5.7 \u00c5 away (Fig. 3a). Assuming that the oxo\u2013hydroxo ligand of the Fe(IV)=O/Fe(III)-OH unit would occupy the open coordination position axial to His259, the binding site is typical of Fe/2OG hydroxylases (Supplementary Figs. 9\u201311).",
        "Crystal structure and activity of the g166D WelO5 variantFrom the crystallographic data, the active site of wild-type (WT) WelO5, when poised for O2 activation, appeared primed to hydroxy-late the substrate. In support of this observation, G166 \u2192 Asp sub-stitution in WelO5 results in exclusive hydroxylation of  1 to give 3 (13R-hydroxyl-12-epi-fischerindole U; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Figs. 12\u201316). Interestingly, when we performed this analysis with WT WelO5, we observed trace amounts of 3 (<2% of  2) (Supplementary Fig. 17), consistent with the reactivity patterns of carrier-protein-dependent halogenases19. A 2.5-\u00c5-resolution structure of G166D WelO5 in complex with 1 shows that Asp166 coordinates Fe(II) and the substrate location observed in WT WelO5 is retained in the vari-ant enzyme (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig.",

        "2OG.Inspection of the structure of WelO5 revealed a distinctive hydrogen-bonding group in the Fe(II) secondary sphere, potentially positioned appropriately to promote ligand dynamics (Fig. 4a, top pathway, in black). Ser189 is located near the C1 carboxylate of 2OG and the coordinated halogen ligand, within hydrogen bonding distance of the former ligand (Fig. 4a\u2013c). In this position, Ser189 could interact directly with the oxygenic ligand in the peroxysuc-cinate, Fe(IV)=O and/or Fe(III)-OH states (Fig. 4a, top pathway, and Supplementary Fig. 19)\u2014but only after the proposed ligand rear-rangement has occurred. The hydrogen-bonding capacity of the side chain would constrain the oxygenic group away from C13 so as to suppress hydroxylation and permit transfer of the cis halogen ligand. Consistent with such a role for Ser189, its substitution by alanine relaxes the selectivity of WelO5, resulting in an equal pro-portion of OH (3)-and Cl (2)-modified products (Fig.",
        "4d).DISCUSSION On the basis of proposals for substrate positioning in SyrB219,20, we predicted that the WelO5 target carbon would reside adjacent to the halogen. In other Fe/2OG enzymes, the position occupied by the coordinated water in the Fe(II)2OG complex is presumed to repre-sent the location of the oxo ligand in the Fe(IV)=O intermediate. We thus anticipated a binding site for 1 in the quadrant defined by the open coordination position and the Cl ligand, likely very close to the latter. In many other crystallographically characterized Fe/2OG enzymes, the analogous site, defined by the positions of the water ligand and carboxylate residue in the H-X-D/E motif, is employed for substrate binding (Supplementary Fig. 9)27. In WelO5, this pocket is accessible to solvent and sufficiently large to accommo-date 1 in the more open state of the active site that we observe in the substrate-free structure. But in the substrate-bound protein, the site is definitively occluded by a conformational change in Phe169, and the substrate instead resides in the opposite quadrant, over His164 (Supplementary Fig. 9). The observed location is, however, consis-tent with the endpoint of a proposed substrate-binding channel in SyrB2 (ref. 16) (Supplementary Fig.",
        "10).The experimentally validated substrate-positioning hypothesis put forth for the control of alternative group transfer in carrier-protein dependent halogenases11,19,21 dictates that the target C-H bond be held away from the Fe(IV)=O unit with the bond vectors close to perpendicular to ensure H abstraction through a \u03c0 pathway20,21. To square this requirement with the observed sub-strate-binding site in WelO5, we considered ligand configurations for the haloferryl intermediate state distinct from that implied by the X-ray crystal structure of the reactant complex. Location of the",
        "oxo unit in the plane defined by His164, 2OG, and the Cl ligand (Fig. 4a) would reconcile the crystallographically observed location of the substrate in WelO5 and the known reactivity trends in the subfamily of Fe/2OG halogenases as a whole11. Indeed, corresponding geom-etries were recently proposed for the halofer-ryl complex in SyrB2 (refs. 20,21). In one of these analyses20, location of the oxo trans to the His164 equivalent is proposed to occur in the context of a trigonal bipyramidal complex (axial positions defined by the oxo and His164 ligands). In WelO5, such a complex could arise via slight migration of the Cl ligand to bring it closer to C13, perhaps an additional feature that would promote selective halogen transfer.

        "1site (Fig. 4b), would yield a highly unfavor-able 1,3-diaxial interaction between the C1 carboxylate and the C3-C4 bond on the tra-jectory to such a rearrangement. Migration, instead, of the oxygen-derived moiety in the Fe(II)\u2013peroxysuccinate (Supplementary Fig. 19) or haloferryl state would obviate this clash. The NO-bound structure of WelO5 (Fig. 4b) also dictates that relocation of the oxo unit away from the C13 halogenation tar-get must occur after O2 addition. Importantly, the arrangement is fully distinct from the findings of an analogous experiment in SyrB2 that shows NO already distal to the substrate chlorination site upon formation of the Fe(II)\u20132OG\u2013Cl complex21.WelO5 exhibits another unusual feature that may serve to promote residency of the haloferryl oxo ligand in the position vacated by the departing C1 functional group. Ser189 is located near the carboxylate and halogen, within hydrogen bonding distance of the for-mer ligand (Fig. 4c). A second notable feature is the absence in the active site of a gener-ally conserved positively charged residue27, typically an arginine, and its replacement by Phe276. In other Fe/2OG enzymes, the side chain of this arginine residue is positioned optimally to hydrogen bond with the oxo moiety of the Fe(IV)=O intermediate. Ser189 and, perhaps, the succinate carboxylate ligand could functionally replace the arginine and the protein carboxylate ligand (Supplementary Fig. 20) to direct the oxo of the Fe(IV)=O unit to the position necessary to enable haloge-nation. The observation that S189A WelO5 displays relaxed halogenation selectivity (Fig. 4d) further supports the idea that a second-sphere hydrogen-bonding group can exert catalytic control in this scaffold.The carrier-protein-dependent haloge-nases, as well as other enzymes in the larger Fe/2OG family with non-hydroxylation out-comes (desaturation, oxacyclization, etc.), may employ strategies similar to those pro-posed here for WelO5. Exploitation of the 2OG co-substrate and outer-sphere hydro-gen-bonding groups in the localization of the reactive intermediate distal to the substrate C-H target might, in a more general sense, facilitate reactions that demand suppression of OH transfer. Indeed, the mechanisms of known Fe/2OG enzymes that catalyze non-canonical reactions12, and in particular how they avoid potentially competing hydroxyla-tion outcomes, remain largely unknown. In the few examples characterized, residues in",
        "peripheral structural elements and/or the intrinsic properties of the substrate are proposed to impede hydroxylation to allow for a different type of reactivity33.

Individual assays for each WelO5 variant with 12-epi-fisherindole U (1, isolated from H. welwitschii B1830 as described previously25 and purified to homogeneity) as the substrate were carried out in HEPES buffer (20 mM), pH = 7.4 on a 100-\u03bcL scale containing the following components: enzyme (20 \u03bcM), 1 (500 \u03bcM), 2OG (1 mM), NaCl (2 mM), and (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 (500 \u03bcM). In a typical assay, all components except (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 and the pro-tein were mixed under ambient conditions and then purged with nitrogen gas. Protein samples were mixed with an aliquot of freshly prepared (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 and pre-purged with nitrogen gas, and the resulting solution was incubated briefly (~10 min) under a nitrogen atmosphere followed by purge with air. The samples were incubated under aerobic conditions at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min. The assay was quenched by extraction with ethyl acetate and centrifugation to isolate the supernatant. The extracts were combined, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and redissolved in methanol (50 \u03bcL). A portion of the methanol solution was injected into a Dionex UHPLC over a Kinetex 2.6 \u03bcm XB-C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 150 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex). Analyses were carried out using a 50% acetonitrile/50% water mobile phase under isocratic conditions using a 0.4 mL/min flow rate with monitoring by UV absorption at 278 nm. For accu-rate mass determination of the enzymatic product(s) derived from each assay, the methanol solution was injected to a Dionex RSLC paired with a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Benchtop Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer.

The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (12 mL \u00d7 3), and combined ethyl acetate extracts were dried under nitrogen gas. The crude material was dissolved in methanol and purified by a Dionex HPLC equipped with a Luna 5um C18 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex).

The target peak eluted with a retention time of 11.0 min and was collected and dried. The regiochemistry of the hydroxyl substituent on 3 was determined by analyzing its 1H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 12) in comparison with those of 1 and 2 (Supplementary Fig. 15) and its 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 13). The relative stereochemistry of the hydroxyl substit-uent on 3 was determined by analyzing its NOESY spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 14). The spectral data are tabulated in Supplementary Table",
        "4.Purification of WelO5 for crystallographic trials. WelO5 containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was overexpressed and purified by Ni-NTA affin-ity chromatography as described25. To remove metal ions incorporated during overexpression, the protein sample was dialyzed at 4 \u00b0C against 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, followed by two rounds of dialysis in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 to remove EDTA. WelO5 was further purified via anion exchange chromatography using a HiPrep DEAE FF column in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and a gradient of 0\u201350% 1 M NaCl over 10 column volumes. Purified WelO5 eluted at 200 mM NaCl. Size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 pg column (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl) yielded a single monodis-perse peak that elutes as an apparent monomer. Fractions containing WelO5 were pooled, exchanged into 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, and concentrated with an Amicon MWCO 10K centrifugal filter. Samples intended for co-crystallization in the presence of bromide, generated to assign the location of the halogen lig-and via anomalous diffraction methods, were produced as described. LC-MS grade chloride-free water used in all of the chromatography procedures and no further purification was performed after the dialysis",
        "step.Crystallization and X-ray structure determination. Purified protein samples were rendered anaerobic by purging for 30 min with argon gas and transferred to an anoxic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products). Protein samples were diluted to 15 mg/mL in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl (or NaBr) and cocrys-tallized with 1 equivalent of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 5 equivalents of 2OG. The samples were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a precipitant solution consisting of 20% PEG 3350, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.5, and 0.1 M Bis-tris pH 5.5. Rod-shaped crystals were obtained in hanging drop vapor diffusion trials within a week of setup. Substrates were incorporated by overlay of crystal drops with 2 \u03bcL of a 2 mM solution of 1 (diluted from a 10 mM stock in DMSO) prepared in the crystallization solution. The soaks were allowed to proceed for 6\u20138 h at room temperature. Crystals were prepared for data collection by mounting on rayon loops after cryoprotection in crystallization solution supplemented with 24% glycerol, followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen for data collection. LC-MS grade water was used to prepare all solutions for bromine co-crystallization experiments. In data sets collected after reaction initiation with O2, the crystal trays were removed from the anaerobic chamber immediately before harvest and exposed to ambient O2 during cryoprotection and harvest. In NO-bound structures, 50\u2013100 \u03bcL of a 64 mM diethylamine NONOate solution prepared in 20 mM NaOH was added to the reservoir solution in the anaerobic chamber before crystal harvest. The well was quickly resealed and, after 30 min incu-bation in the NO-enriched atmosphere, the crystals were harvested and flash frozen as previously",
        "described.WelO5 crystallizes in the P212121 space group with three molecules in the asymmetric unit. G166D WelO5 crystals belong to the C2 space group with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit.

Resulting diffraction images were processed with the software package HKL2000 (ref. 34). Phase information was obtained using iron single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods. A data set col-lected at 1.74 \u00c5 yielded usable anomalous signal to 3.9 \u00c5 resolution. The pro-gram autoSHARP35 was used to locate three heavy atom sites (phasing power of 0.58) that correspond to the native iron cofactor in each WelO5 monomer in the ASU. Solvent flattening and density modification procedures generated interpretable electron density maps that were subjected to an autobuilding pro-cedure using ARP/wARP36. The initial model was then refined against a native data set collected to 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. All subsequent structures were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER37 with the substrate-free WelO5 model",

The model consists of residues 11\u2013290 in chains A and C, residues 10\u2013290 in chain B, three Fe(II) ions, three chlorine atoms, three molecules of 2OG, and 456 water molecules. Ramachandran and Molprobity analyses indicate 100% of the resi-dues in preferred and allowed regions with a clashscore of 0.61 and three rotamer outliers. Soak of WelO5 crystals with 1 yielded electron density for the molecule in all three WelO5 monomers in the ASU (Supplementary Fig. 5), but the molecule was only modeled into two of the active site chains, A and B. Only chain B displays full occupancy of 1, and substrate binding is associated with clear evidence for a conformational change in the external helix motif and rotamer change in the side chain of Phe169. These structural changes are located at the periphery of the protein structure and are not observed in the other two molecules in the ASU due to more extensive engagement of the cor-responding regions in lattice contacts (Supplementary Fig. 3). Irrespective of these peripheral conformational changes, a short loop region in the core fold (residues 79\u201382) containing a motif that interacts with the isocyanide moiety in 1 shifts inwards toward the substrate-binding site in all three molecules, con-sistent with partial occupancy of these sites by 1. In chain B, residues 11\u2013290 can be modeled, although the density for residues 215\u2013219 is weak compared to the surrounding peptide chain. In chain C, residues 11\u2013215 and 220\u2013290 can be modeled. Residues 216\u2013219 are disordered and were not included in the final model. In chain A, residues 10\u2013290 can be modeled but no movement of the external helix is observed, consistent with observation of more extensive lattice contacts in this monomer. The model for substrate-bound WelO5 also contains three Fe(II) ions, three chlorine atoms, three molecules of 2OG, and 251 water molecules. Ramachandran and Molprobity analyses indicate 99.5% of the residues in preferred and allowed regions with a clashscore of 1.44 and no rotamer",
