These studies elucidate key frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and their contribution to H atom abstraction reactivity. The VT MCD spectra of the enzymatic S = 2 FeIV\u2550O intermediate with Br-ligation contain information-rich features that largely parallel the corresponding spectra of the S = 2 model complex (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (Srnec, M.; Wong, S. D.; England, J; Que, L; Solomon, E. I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2012, 109, 14326\u201314331). However, quantitative differences are observed that correlate with \u03c0-anisotropy and oxo donor strength that perturb FMOs and affect reactivity. Due to \u03c0-anisotropy, the FeIV\u2550O active site exhibits enhanced reactivity in the direction of the substrate cavity that proceeds through a \u03c0-channel that is controlled by perpendicular orientation of the substrate C\u2013H bond relative to the halide\u2013FeIV\u2550O plane. Also, the increased intrinsic reactivity of the SyrB2 intermediate relative to the ferryl model complex is correlated to a higher oxyl character of the FeIV\u2550O at the transition states resulting from the weaker ligand field of the halogenase.*Corresponding Author: edward.solomon@stanford.edu.

INTRODUCTIONSyringomycin halogenase (SyrB2) is a member of the mononuclear nonheme iron (NHFe) enzymes family that activates 3O2, through formation of a key high-spin (S = 2) FeIV\u2550O intermediate, for H atom abstraction (HAA) from an unreactive C\u2013H bond to perform halogenation or hydroxylation.1 To date, six NHFe enzymatic FeIV\u2550O intermediates have been trapped and spectroscopically characterized mostly by using M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, five of which are \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) dependent (taurine dioxygenase (TauD),2,3 prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H),4 cytotrienin halogenase (CytC3),5,6 syringomicyn halogenase (SyrB2),1,7 carbapenem synthase (CarC)8) and the other two are pterin dependent (tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH)9 and phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH)10). In the catalytic cycle of SyrB2, for which the substrate-free crystal structure from ref 11 is displayed in Figure 1A, the halide atom is incorporated into the methyl group of the L-threonine ~ SyrB1 substrate (Figure 1B) in the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin syringomycin E.12NHFeIV\u2550O enzyme intermediates have stimulated synthetic efforts to prepare FeIV\u2550O compounds to elucidate crucial physicochemical factors that contribute to their reactivity in Nature.13 While most of the FeIV\u2550O model complexes have low-spin (S = 1) ground states,14 some models have the S = 2 spin state that is present in the enzymatic intermediates.15 A combined spectroscopic and computational study of one of the S = 2 model complexes, (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O,15a elucidated three reactive channels available for HAA: two are active when the C\u2013H bond is oriented perpendicular to the Fe\u2013oxo bond (\u03c0 channels leading to SFe = 5/2 or SFe = 3/2 FeIII\u2013OH intermediates) and one that is active for C\u2013H bonds oriented along the Fe\u2013oxo bond (\u03c3 channel providing an SFeIII = 5/2 intermediate).16 This is strikingly different from the S = 1 FeIV\u2550O complexes, which have only one available channel, \u03c0(SFeIII = 3/2).17 Thus, S = 2 active sites in NHFe enzymes have both \u03c0 and \u03c3 channels providing flexibility in using different substrate orientations to control selectivity.18 Note that the \u03c3-and \u03c0-channels for HAA reactivity of S = 1 and S = 2 NHFeIV\u2550O systems are also discussed in ref 19.Recently nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS), correlated with density functional theory, allowed elucidation of the structure of the FeIV\u2550O intermediate in SyrB2.20 This has a 5C, trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) structure with the Fe\u2013oxo bond oriented along its ~ C3 axis and perpendicular to the C\u2013H bond of the substrate. This had important Srnec et al.Page 2J Am Chem Soc.

In the presence of the alternative substrate L-norvaline, L-Nva, the analogous O2 reaction pathway was proposed to lead to an FeIV\u2550O intermediate now with its Fe\u2013oxo bond oriented toward the C\u2013H bond of the substrate. This led to \u03c3-channel reactivity (Figure 1C right) that was suggested to be important in the hydroxylation reaction with this substrate (Figure 1B).20In the present study we build on this NRVS-defined geometric structure of the FeIV\u2550O intermediate in the halogenase. Variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VT MCD) spectroscopy is performed on the FeIV\u2550O SyrB2 intermediate with bound Br-and correlated with high-level multireference ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to define the electronic structure of this FeIV\u2550O intermediate. Quantitative comparison to our previous study16 of (TMG3tren)-FeIV\u2550O elucidates electronic structure contributions to their relative HAA reactivities.2. EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS2.1. Sample PreparationSamples of the SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O intermediate with a concentration of ~ 1.8 mM were prepared as described in ref 7 and in the Supporting Information of ref 20 (therein see Figure S9). 2.2. Electronic Absorption (Abs) and Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) SpectroscopyThe Abs spectrum of the enzyme was measured with the Agilent HP8453 diode array spectrophotometer at ~ 285 K. UV/vis VT MCD data (16 000\u201330 000 cm-1) were collected on a Jasco J810 spectrophotometer with an extended S-20 photomultiplier tube, and near-infrared (NIR) VT MCD data (5000\u201316000 cm-1) were collected on a Jasco J730 spectrophotometer with a liquid N2-cooled InSn detector. The sample temperature was measured using a calibrated Cernox resistor (Lakeshore Cryogenics) inserted into the MCD cell. A magnetic field of 7T was applied using an Oxford SM 4000-7T superconducting magnet. 2.3. Vibronic-Structure AnalysisThe Franck\u2013Condon (FC) vibronic progressions are simulated in the harmonic approximation as a Poisson distribution:Srnec et al.Page 3J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 20.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript (1) where S is the Huang\u2013Rhys factor defined by the equation Sn/n! = \u0394\u03b50\u2192n/\u0394\u03b50\u21920 reflecting the progression band shape, \u0394E is the vibronic spacing corresponding to the frequency of the excited-state Fe\u2013oxo stretching mode (in cm-1), \u0394fwhm is the full width in the half-maximum of each individual peak in the progression (in cm-1), \u0394\u03b5 is the intensity distribution over the band, and E0\u21920 and \u0394\u03b50\u21920 are the energy (in cm-1) and the intensity maximum (in M-1 cm-1) of the first peak in the progression. E is the variable photon energy (in cm-1). The excited-state distortion (along Fe\u2013oxo bond) with respect to the ground state, \u0394Q (in \u00c5), is obtained from(2) with the reduced mass \u03bc of the Fe\u2013oxo stretching mode that is considered in this study to be 15 amu; S and \u0394E (in cm-1) are defined above. The parabolic shape of the excited-state potential-energy surface (PES) and its \u0394Q and energy (relative to the ground-state PES) along the mode Q is derived from the FC analysis using(3) where \u03bc (in amu), \u0394Q (in \u00c5), and \u0394E (in cm-1) are defined above; EPES is the energy of the PES (in cm-1) along Q that corresponds to the Fe\u2013oxo bond length (in \u00c5) with Q0 as the ground-state equilibrium geometry (in \u00c5); and Emin is the energy of the excited-state PES minimum (in cm-1), which is determined as E0\u21920 + (\u0394EGS-\u0394E)/2, where E0\u21920 and \u0394E are defined above and \u0394EGS is the frequency of the Fe\u2013oxo stretching mode in the ground state.2.4. Structural ModelIf not stated otherwise, the cluster model of the Br-/Cl-ligating ferryl intermediate, which was taken from ref 20, consists of one Fe center, one halide, one crystal water molecule, truncated (His116, His235, succinate) ligands, truncated second-shell (Arg254, Thr143, Glu102) residues, and a substrate fragment with its thioester group capped by a H atom (see Figure 1D for the truncated model consisting of 89 atoms). (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O was taken from ref 16. For RASSCF/CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations (section 2.6), the size of the structural model of (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O was reduced to 53 atoms (only the Arg254 fragment and one (crystal) water molecule are present in the second shell; see Figure S1), while the truncated model of (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O was taken from ref 16.Srnec et al.Page 4J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 20.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript 2.5. Density Functional Theory CalculationsMost of DFT calculations reported in this study were performed using the Turbomole 6.3 program.23 Unless otherwise mentioned, the hybrid three-parameter Becke\u2019s (B3LYP)24 functional with the empirical correction to dispersion effect (+D2)25 was used throughout. All of the geometry optimizations were carried out using the def2-SVP basis set, whereas the single-point energies were recomputed with the def2-TZVP basis set.In single-point calculations, to allow for solvation effects, the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) was used with a dielectric constant reflecting the protein environment (\u03b5r = 4.0). Reaction and activation Gibbs free energies were evaluated (using the option \u201cfrznuclei\u201d for the vibrational analyses of systems with fixed atoms) according to the equation:(4) where  is the reaction (or activation) energy of the solvated system (at the B3LYP+D2/def2-TZVP/COSMO(\u03b5r=4.0)//B3LYP+D2/def2-SVP level),  is the change in zero-point energy, and  accounts for the change in the reaction (or activation) entropic terms and the thermal correction to the enthalpy as obtained from a frequency calculation (at 298 K, 1 atm; ideal-gas approximation) using the geometry optimization calculations.2.6. CASSCF/CASPT2/SO-CASSI CalculationsThe state-average complete active space self-consistent field (SA-CASSCF)26 and multistate complete active space second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2)27 calculations were carried out using the MOLCAS 7.4 program.28 For all of the atoms, the ANO-RCC basis set (contracted to [7s6p5d2f1g] for Fe, [6s5p3d] for Br, [4s3p1d] for the ligating O, N atoms, [3s2p] for other N, O, and C atoms, and [2s] for H) was used. The second-order Douglas\u2013Kroll\u2013Hess (DKH2) one-electron spinless Hamiltonian was applied for all of the calculations in order to allow for spin-free relativistic effects.29The SA-CASSCF/MS-CASPT2 potential energy surfaces along the Fe\u2013O vibration mode of the Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O intermediate (obtained from the BP86/def2-SVP frequency analysis using the G09 program package30)20 were calculated with the 16-electrons-in-11-orbitals active space including 5 dFe, 3 poxo, and 3 ligand-based orbitals (orbitals and further technical details of the CASSCF calculations are in the Supporting Information (SI), Figure S2). The state-average CASSCF and multistate CASPT2 calculations were performed over the three lowest S = 2 and ten lowest S = 1 states.As an extension of the CASSCF approach, the state-average restricted active space self-consistent field (SA-RASSCF)31 calculations were used for simulating electronic spectra (for technical details, see SI on pp S4\u2013S5 and Figure S3). Within these RASSCF Srnec et al.Page 5J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 20.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript calculations, the RAS3 subspace includes Fe 4d orbitals to partially account for the double-shell effect to improve the accuracy of the calculated spectra.32Spin\u2013orbit couplings (SOCs) were calculated using the spin\u2013orbit complete active space state interaction (SO-CASSI) method and solving the generalized eigenvalue problem of first-order QDPT [taking the atomic mean-field integral (AMFI) spin\u2013orbit Hamiltonian33 as the perturbation] to obtain the SOC-corrected quasi-relativistic energies.34 To improve the accuracy of the calculations, the CASPT2 energies were used on the diagonal of the two-component Hamiltonian matrix.In all of the CASSCF or RASSCF calculations, a level shift of 0.5 au was used in order to improve convergence. In the CASPT2 calculations, none of the orbitals were frozen, and an imaginary level shift of 0.2 au was used to eliminate intruder states.353. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS3.1. Absorption and MCD Spectra of SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O Intermediate3.1.1. Band Assignments and Correlation to Spectra of the (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O Model Complex (from Ref 16)\u2014Figure 2A shows the UV\u2013visible Abs and VT MCD spectra of the high-spin (S = 2) SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O/L-Cpg intermediate. The abs spectrum shows a weak feature at 12 000 cm-1 and two more intense broad features centered at 19 000 and 26 000 cm-1. These become much more well-resolved and feature-rich in the LT MCD spectrum, which thus allows definitive band assignments for electronic-structure elucidation. First, within the theory developed in ref 36, fitting the temperature dependence of the MCD bands (data given in Figure 2B varying from T = 2 K through 60 K) allows an estimate of the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters that are D = +7 cm-1 and E/D = 0.02 for SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O (Figure S4). These parameters are in the range of those determined from magnetic M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the Cl\u2013FeIV\u2550O intermediate in halogenase CytC3 (D = +7 cm-1 and E/D = 0.02).5 Once the ZFS is known, the polarizations of the MCD bands can be determined using the methodology from refs 17, 37 (described in the caption to Figure S4). The positive ZFS D parameter gives the splitting of the \u00b1Ms sublevels of an S = 2 species with Ms = 0 lowest in energy. For a z-polarized transition, the lowest-energy sublevel at a magnetic field of 7T is the MCD-active Ms = -1, so the MCD intensity is high at low T and decreases with an increase in T because the population of the Ms = -1 sublevel decreases, and the populations of the MCD-inactive Ms = 0 and the opposite-signed Ms = +1 increase. For x/y-polarized transitions, the magnetic field has a nonvanishing component along the z axis for MCD intensity and the lowest sublevel at 7T is the MCD-inactive Ms = 0 sublevel. This leads to MCD intensity that decreases with increasing temperature at a lower rate than the z-polarized MCD intensity due to populations of the MCD-active Ms = +1 and Ms = -1 sublevels that produce MCD intensities of opposite signs (Figure S4).In the near-infrared region (NIR), between 6000 and 15000 cm-1, there are distinct positive and negative MCD Franck\u2013Condon (FC) vibronic progressions centered around 11000 cm-1 that form a derivative-shaped pseudo-A term with the negative component at higher energy Srnec et al.Page 6J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 20.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript (feature I in the MCD spectrum in Figure 2A). The temperature-dependent behavior of the pseudo-A term feature indicates that it is x/y-polarized (Figure S4). This transition has a fairly large MCD-to-absorption intensity (C0/D0) ratio (0.150) allowing it to be assigned as a ligand-field (LF) transition. The NIR VT MCD spectrum of the SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O intermediate is remarkably similar in terms of band energy, derivative band shape, C0/D0 ratio, and temperature dependence to the MCD spectrum of the S = 2 (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O model complex studied in ref 16 (and included for comparison in Figure 2B and Table 1). It is noteworthy that despite these similarities, the pseudo-A feature in Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O is approximately three times weaker than the equivalent MCD feature in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (its C0/D0 for feature I is ~ 0.250). Overall, these results allow assignment of the NIR MCD band I in (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O as the 5A \u2192 5E LF transition involving electron excitation from the dxz \u03c0* and dyz \u03c0* orbitals into the dz2 \u03c3* orbital, transitions that are degenerate in the C3 symmetry of (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O.In the 15 000\u201330 000 cm-1 region of the MCD spectrum, there are four temperature-dependent MCD features located at ~ 17 500, ~ 21 500, ~ 24 000, and ~ 27 000 cm-1. The two lower-energy bands (labeled II and III in Figure 2A) are determined from the temperature-dependence MCD intensity (Figure S4) to be z-polarized C terms that can be assigned to charge-transfer (CT) transitions on the basis of their low C0/D0 ratios of 0.005 and 0.050, respectively. The two higher-energy MCD features at ~ 24000 and ~ 27000 cm-1 in Figure 2B cannot be analyzed because of a minor overlapping heme contaminant in the sample (that produces a large MCD contribution). As in the near-infrared region, the UV\u2013vis VT MCD spectra of SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O and (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (bands II and III from Figure 2A and B) have very similar spectroscopic characteristics including MCD signs, their the positive (i.e., left circularly polarized, LCP) and the negative (i.e., right circularly polarized, RCP) vibronic progressions were derived (Figure 3B). These parabolas are clearly different: the PES of the RCP state is broad and more distorted from the ground-state minimum and higher in energy at the ground-state equilibrium geometry than the PES for the LCP state. From these PESs, the RCP state becomes lower in energy at the longer Fe\u2013O bond lengths relevant to the TS of the \u03c0 channel for HAA (vide infra)There are thus quantitative differences in what was found from the MCD spectrum of the (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O species for the 5A \u2192 5E LF transitions relative to the results for (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O. For (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, the high-energy RCP component of the pseudo-A term in the NIR MCD spectrum had a smaller Huang\u2013Rhys factor and larger vibronic spacing (S = 1.2 and \u0394E = 880 cm-1)16 reflecting a narrower, less distorted PES for the RCP state as compared to the PES of the LCP state (S = 2.8 and \u0394E = 710 cm-1). This requires a significant difference in the nature of the interactions among the excited states that shape these 5E PESs. In the trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) C3 model complex (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, the high-energy, narrower, and less distorted RCP-active PES resulted from a strong spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) interaction between this component of the in-state SOC split 5E (dxz/yz \u03c0*\u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF) state and a nearby triplet.16 For SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O, it is the low-energy LCP PES that is narrower and less distorted. As explained below this results from a low-symmetry splitting of the dxz/yz \u03c0*\u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF 5E state, due to the presence of the equatorial halide ligand (Figure 4).We finally note that the temperature-dependent MCD data for (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O in the band I region require more than two FC progressions. From the FC analysis presented in Figure 3A, the first, fourth, and the fifth negative peaks do not overlap with the LCP peaks and hence the intensities of these peaks should behave the same with a change of temperature. However, from Figure 5A, the temperature dependence of the first negative peak is different from that of the fourth and fifth negative peaks. This indicates that these peaks, in fact, belong to different RCP vibronic progressions. This is reflected in Figure 5B by a three FC progression fit of the pseudo-A term feature where the first (lower-energy) RCP progression has a distinctly larger S and smaller \u0394E than its high-energy RCP cognate. The origin of the two RCP progressions is evaluated in section 3.2.2.3.2. Quantum-Chemical (Multiconfigurational and Multireference) Calculations; Spectroscopy 3.2.1. Calculated Electronic Spectrum and Correlation to MCD Data\u2014The structural model for the multiconfigurational/multireference calculations was obtained, as described in section 2.4, by truncation of the five-coordinate trigonal-bipyramidal (TBP) FeIV\u2550O structure, which was determined in ref 20 from synchrotron-based nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) in combination with DFT calculations (for structures see Figure S1). The RASSCF calculated electronic spectrum of this SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O structure along with that of (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O is shown in Figure 6. Importantly, these calculations correlate well with the experimental spectra in Figure 2:We first consider the LF region, band I. For SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O, there are two calculated near-infrared x/y-polarized transitions with LF character, the dxz/yz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* transitions Srnec et al.Page 8J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 20.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript that are split by 1520 cm-1 (as shown in Figure 6; cf. experimental 700 cm-1) and have energies that are close to values obtained from the experimental MCD pseudo-A term, band I in Figure 2A (i.e., calculated 10 280 and 11 800 cm-1 vs experimental 9500 and 10200 cm-1). These calculated transition energies are comparable to that of the corresponding 2-fold degenerate transition in the C3 symmetric (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O model complex, which also agrees with the experimental data in Figure 2B.We next consider the CT spectrum of (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O. From group theory for effective C3 symmetry, three oxo \u03c0 \u2192 dxz,yz \u03c0* CT transitions are predicted: one is 2-fold degenerate (5E) and x/y-polarized, while two are nondegenerate (5A) and z-polarized. The same is predicted for the oxo \u03c0 \u2192 Fe dxy/x2-y2 CT transitions. According to the nonrelativistic multiconfigurational calculations for (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, the lowest-energy CT state is the oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* 5E state at ~ 24 630 cm-1, whereas the two other oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* states (the 5A\u2019s) are at ~ 25 040 and ~ 31 290 cm-1 (Figure 6). The three oxo \u03c0 \u2192 Fe dxy/x2-y2 CT states in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (labeled oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d) are calculated at ~ 27 880, ~ 29 930, and ~ 31 290 cm-1, respectively (Figure 6); the first is z-polarized and has the largest oscillator strength among all of excitations in the 0\u201332 000 cm-1 region. This lowest oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d CT is attributed to the intense band III in the experimental spectrum of the model complex in Figure 2B. While the lowest-energy experimental CT transition, i.e., band II in the MCD spectrum of the model compound Figure 2B, is z-polarized (Table 1), the lowest calculated oxo-to-Fe CT transition (5Ags \u2192 5E CT) in the model in Figure 6 is x/y-polarized. This discrepancy can be reconciled by the fact that the lowest-energy calculated z-polarized nondegenerate oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* CT transition (5Ags \u2192 5A CT) is predicted only 500 cm-1 above the 5Ags \u2192 5E CT. This z-polarized oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* CT (~ 25 040 cm-1) has 5A symmetry and can undergo configuration interaction with the most intense z-polarized oxo \u03c0 \u2192 Fe d CT (band III). Even a few percent CI mixing would produce significant z-polarized intensity and give rise to band II in Abs and MCD spectra of the ferryl model compound (Figure 2B).Taking advantage of the analysis of the oxo-to-Fe CTs in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, the eight calculated lowest-energy low-symmetry split CT transitions for the SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O active site can be straightforwardly identified. The calculated transitions at ~ 21 040 and ~ 23 140 cm-1 are the low-symmetry split components of the lowest-energy 2-fold degenerate x/y-polarized oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* CT (Figure 6, red). However, these two excitations are masked by the more intense z-polarized transitions, oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* CT calculated at ~ 21 760 cm-1 and oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d at ~ 23 220 cm-1 (bold red lines in Figure 6), that correlate with the first and the second 5Ags \u2192 5A CT in the C3-symmetric (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O complex, respectively. Thus, bands II and III in the experimental spectrum of (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O in Figure 2A can be assigned as the oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* and oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d CT transitions, due to the equatorial bromide. In comparing this region between SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O and (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, there are several differences. The C3 degenerate pair of dxz/yz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF excited states split in energy in the low-symmetry structure of Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O giving rise to the lower-energy LCP and higher-energy RCP transitions. These gain MCD intensities through a C-term mechanism36 that involves SOC between these states to form a derivative-shaped pseudo-A term. The equations that govern C-term intensities related to these SOC-interacting excited states (labeled 2 and 3 below; 1 is the ground state 5A) is(5) (6) where E2 and E3 are energies of states 2 and 3, gz is the z-component of the Zeeman tensor for the ground state (state 1),  is the x-component of the transition dipole moment from 1 to 2, and  is the z-term of the SOC operator between states 2 and 3, etc. Using CASPT2 calculations, state 2 is determined to arise from the dyz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF transition (Fe\u2013oxo and Fe\u2013Br define the z and y axes, respectively) that is calculated to be lower in energy than the dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF state (state 3). This energy difference is due to the dyz \u03c0* orbital that interacts with the halide and is at higher energy than dxz \u03c0* and thus lowering the energy of the dyz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* state relative to the dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* transition. As given in Figure 7, calculations, in agreement with the experiment, identify the LCP-active dyz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* state to be lower in energy (state 2) than its RCP-active dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* cognate (state 3). It is noteworthy that calculated SOC interaction between LCP and RCP states is ~ 120 cm-1 in SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O, which is smaller than SOC between the corresponding states in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (~ 220 cm-1);16 this is in line with the observation of lower pseudo-A term MCD intensity (and lower C0/D0 ratio) for the Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O species than for (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (cf., Figure 2 and Table 1). This decreased SOC indicates a larger relativistic nephelauxetic effect due to the higher covalency of the Fe\u2013oxo bond relative to the N-based chelating ligation in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (vide infra).To further correlate calculations with the experimental data, the CASPT2 ground-state and two lowest excited-state PESs in the Fe\u2013oxo coordinate were evaluated (Figure 8). Importantly, the excited-state PESs reproduce the main features of the MCD-derived PESs (from Figure 3B): (i) the LCP-active PES is lower in energy at ground-state equilibrium than RCP-active PES (quantitatively the calculations overestimate the experiment by a factor of ~ 2 that corresponds to an error of ~ 1.5 kcal mol-1); (ii) the LCP-state distortion is smaller than that of the RCP state, \u0394QLCP = 0.095 \u00c5 vs \u0394QRCP = 0.124 \u00c5 (cf., experimental values in Figure 3B); (iii) the RCP PES decreases in energy more than the LCP PES in going from the ground-state equilibrium (indicated by a vertical line in Figure 8) to their respective excited-state PES minima; (iv) the frequency of the LCP state Fe\u2013oxo stretching mode Srnec et al.Page 10J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 20.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript (estimated from a third-order Taylor expansion fit of the PES) is higher than that of the RCP state, \u0394ELCP \u2248 870 cm-1 vs \u0394ERCP \u2248 790 cm-1 (cf., experimental values in Figure 3B).The different PES curvatures and distortions of the LCP and RCP states in the vicinity of the ground-state equilibrium are attributed to the anisotropy of the \u03c0 FMOs. Namely, the p orbitals of the Br-ligand interact with dyz \u03c0* (y along Fe\u2013Br, vide supra; orbitals shown in Figure 8) but not with dxz \u03c0*. As a consequence, the dyz \u03c0* has less Fe d character than dxz synthetic and enzymatic active sites, along with their parallel spectroscopic data, provide a basis for evaluating electronic structure contributions to the protein \u03c0-promoted HAA reactivity. 3.3.1. Configuration Evolution of FMOs\u2014From section 3.2.1, the calculations correlated with spectroscopy show the oxo-to-Fe CT states to be lower in energy in SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O than those in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O. This reflects larger CI mixing of the oxo-to-Fe (py \u03c0 \u2192 dyz \u03c0* and px \u03c0 \u2192 dxz \u03c0*) CT configurations into the dyz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* and dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF states at the ground-state equilibrium geometry of (SyrB2)-FeIV\u2550O as compared to (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (cf., ~ 40% vs ~ 20% CT admixtures into the dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF state; Figure 10). This is consistent with the more covalent Fe\u2013O bond in SyrB2 than that in TMG3tren. From Figure 10, in passing from the ground-state equilibrium to the transition-state Fe\u2013O bond lengths, the dashed line representing the oxyl FeIII character evolves more rapidly for the enzyme than for the model complex (cf. ~ 65% vs ~ 35% of FeIII\u2014O\u2022-admixtures into the dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF state at the TS Fe\u2013O lengths in Figure 10). While both \u03c0* FMOs in TMG3tren remain equivalent along the Fe\u2013O reaction coordinate (i.e., oxyl character in both \u03c0 directions evolves equally), the \u03c0-anisotropy in SyrB2 leads at longer Fe\u2013O distances to the increased oxyl character oriented in the direction of the substrate (cf. 60% of \u03c0yz-oxyl vs 65% of \u03c0xz-oxyl at the TS; Figure S5). This correlates with the difference in halide donation to dyz \u03c0* relative to the dxz \u03c0* orbital; the latter thus undergoes more FeIV\u2550O \u2192 FeIII\u2013oxyl polarization at the TS (section 3.2.2). In correlating from the spectroscopic analysis to reactivity, only the LF RCP-active state, corresponding to the dxz \u03c0* FMO, is involved in the HAA \u03c0 pathway, as this is oriented toward the substrate cavity. While this state is higher in energy than the LCP dyz \u03c0* state in ground-state equilibrium geometry, it has a softer PES in the Fe\u2013O bond (Figure 8) and becomes lower in energy at Fe\u2013O lengths (i.e., >1.82 \u00c5) corresponding to the transition state for C\u2013H abstraction.Finally, in analogy to the MCD study in ref 16, it is noteworthy that for SyrB2 halide\u2013FeIV\u2550O there are two additional S = 2 (ground and the lowest-energy oxo-to-Fe CT) states capable of an H atom abstraction. However, in contrast to TMG3tren, these two states associated with one \u03c3 and one \u03c0(SFeIII = 3/2) HAA channels are not operative in SyrB2. First, the \u03c3-channel that is associated with d\u03c3* FMO is excluded due to the perpendicular orientation of the substrate with respect to the Fe\u2013O vector (Figure 9A). Second, in comparison to TMG3tren, the PES of the lowest-energy oxo-to-Fe CT state in SyrB2 (Figure S8) is less distorted and steeper at longer Fe\u2013O distances so that it becomes higher in energy for Fe\u2013O lengths of >1.9 \u00c5. This indicates that the \u03c0(SFeIII = 3/2)-channel for HAA is less accessible in SyrB2 than that in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O. This difference in PES curvature is attributed to a difference in H-bonding to the oxo moiety by its environment (two H-bonds in SyrB2 vs no H-bond in TMG3tren, Figure S8).3.3.2. H Atom Abstraction by FeIV\u2550O; Correlation of SyrB2 to TMG3tren\u2014For the comparison of HAA in SyrB2 vs TMG3tren, the experimental kcat values (0.071 vs 0.02 s-1)7,15a indicate that activation free energies in both systems are of similar magnitudes, 19.1 Srnec et al.Page 12J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 20.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript vs 19.9 kcal mol-1, slightly favoring the enzyme. However, there is a large difference in the strengths of the substrate C\u2013H bonds. Experimentally, for methyl groups of small molecules representing threonine (2-propanol) and the chelate ligand (trimethylamine), these are 947 and 86 \u00b1 238 kcal mol-1, respectively. The calculated difference using the present methodology is 10 kcal mol-1. The fact that (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O is capable of an H atom abstraction from a stronger C\u2013H bond with a lower reaction barrier suggests that the enzyme is more reactive in HAA than its synthetic counterpart.DFT calculations are consistent with the experimental results (Table 2): the barrier of the \u03c0(SFeIII = 5/2)-controlled HAA reaction in SyrB2, calculated for the cluster model in the absence of the second-shell Arg residue (see footnote in Table 2), is lower than the corresponding pathway in the model complex (cf., \u0394G\u2260 19.8 vs 21.4 kcal mol-1; TSs shown in Figure S9; for \u03c0-trajectories in SyrB2 vs TMG3tren, see Figure 9) despite its larger endergonicity (cf., \u0394G\u00b0 2.3 vs 0.5 kcal mol-1). The fact that the thermodynamically less favorable reaction is kinetically more feasible indicates an increased intrinsic reactivity of the enzyme system. Indeed, elimination of the effect of the thermodynamic driving force on the reaction barrier through Marcus theory gives an intrinsic barrier \u0394G\u2260intr (=[\u0394G\u2260 -1/2\u0394G\u00b0 + (\u0394G\u22602 -\u0394G\u2260\u0394G\u00b0)1/2]/2)39 of 18.6 (SyrB2) and 21.6 kcal mol-1 (TMG3tren). The lowered intrinsic barrier for \u03c0-controlled HAA in the enzyme correlates well with the increased \u03c0-oxyl character of enzymatic FeIV\u2550O relative to the model ferryl complex at the TS that was revealed by the spectrocopically supported calculations of the lowest excited state in section 3.3.1.4. DISCUSSIONThis study on SyrB2 has focused on using MCD spectroscopy to determine the electronic structure of the FeIV\u2550O intermediate based on its geometric structure from NRVS in ref 20 and quantitative comparisons to studies on TMG3tren.16 Importantly, there are strong parallels to the MCD spectra of the (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O model complex (i.e., energies and signs of MCD bands, and related spectroscopic characteristics including C0/D0 ratios, ground-state ZFS and polarizations of the electronic transitions) that confirm the ~ C3 TBP arrangement of the FeIV\u2550O site in SyrB2 and allow us to define its ground and low-lying excited electronic states that relate to its FMOs. However, the comparison also reveals differences: the oxo \u03c0\u2192 d\u03c0* CT transitions are shifted down in energy in SyrB2, the C0/D0 ratio for band I is reduced by a factor of ~ 2, and the vibronic structure in the ~ 12 000 cm-1 (pseudo-A) band I, assigned as the pair of d\u03c0* \u2192 d\u03c3* LF transitions, is different. These observations reflect quantitative differences in the FMOs. The lower-energy CT reflects a smaller energy gap between oxo px/y and dxz/yz \u03c0* orbitals indicating a greater oxo donor interaction reflecting a weaker donor ligand set for the SyrB2 active site. This is also consistent with the lower C0/D0 ratio of feature I in Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O relative to (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O as this increased oxo character lowers the SOC. The change in vibronic structure indicates a \u03c0 anisotropy in SyrB2 due to the equatorial halide ligand (Scheme 1A and B), i.e., a low-symmetry splitting of the dxz \u03c0* and dyz \u03c0* orbitals with dxz \u03c0* being nonbonding with the Br-(Scheme 1C). This \u03c0 anisotropy results in different shapes of the PESs along the Fe\u2013oxo stretching coordinate. This leads to a lowest-energy dxz \u03c0* FMO orbital at longer Fe\u2013O distances that is oriented toward the substrate cavity (Scheme 1C).Srnec et al.Page 13J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 20.A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript A uthor Manuscript Ab initio calculations based on the NRVS-determined geometric structure reproduce these MCD-derived data for SyrB2 and the trends in electronic spectra in going from (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O to SyrB2 Br\u2014FeIV\u2550O. This allows a correlation of the spectroscopic data with the reactivity of the SyrB2 FeIV\u2550O intermediate. The decrease in energy between the oxo-based \u03c0 and Fe-dxz/yz \u03c0* orbitals results in their larger CI admixture into the d\u03c0* \u2192 d\u03c3* LF states. This facilitates spin polarization in the Fe\u2013oxo bond and increases its FeIII(SFe = 5/2)\u2013oxyl character at the TS, compared to (TMG3tren)-FeIV\u2550O. Also, due to the \u03c0 anisotropy associated with the equatorial halide there are differences in strength and distortion of the Fe\u2013oxo bond between the RCP dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF and LCP dyz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF states (Scheme 1B and C). The RCP dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF state, active in \u03c0-controlled H atom abstraction due to its orientation toward the C\u2013H bond, has a weaker, more distorted Fe\u2013oxo bond. Thus, the dxz \u03c0* state becomes lower in energy at Fe\u2013O lengths relevant to the TS and hence has increased HAA reactivity in the direction of the substrate cavity (Scheme 1B and C).Indeed, the \u03c0-channel for HAA by the SyrB2 FeIV\u2550O intermediate (with the substrate C\u2013H bond perpendicular to the Cl\u2013FeIV\u2550O plane) involves the RCP dxz \u03c0* state and produces the Cl\u2013FeIII\u2013OH/L-Thr\u2022 first intermediate. The comparison with the model complex (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O reveals that the FeIV\u2550O enzymatic intermediate is intrinsically more \u03c0-reactive due to its higher oxyl character and lower Fe\u2013oxo stretching frequency as observed by MCD spectroscopy.5. CONCLUSIONSThis study used low-temperature MCD spectroscopy to define the electronic structure of the S = 2 (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O intermediate, for which the 5C TBP geometric structure was previously determined by NRVS. The VT MCD spectra, obtained for this SyrB2 NHFeIV\u2550O intermediate, show features that largely parallel those observed for the TBP S = 2 (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O model complex and provide significant insight into the low-lying S = 2 excited states and the associated FMOs. The comparison of SyrB2 FeIV\u2550O with (TMG3tren)-FeIV\u2550O further allows evaluation of the oxo\u2013Fe bonding and the low-symmetry effects due to a halide on the nature of the FMOs (potential energy surfaces of low-lying S = 2 states). This increased oxo character and \u03c0-anisotropy enhance the HAA reactivity along the direction of the substrate. The H atom abstraction pathway occurs through a \u03c0 channel leading to the TBP halide\u2013FeIII(S = 5/2)\u2013OH intermediate.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Acknowledgments The project was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Award Numbers R01GM040392 to E.I.S. and R01GM69657 to J.M.B. and C.K., by the National Science Foundation (MCB-642058 and CHE-724084 to J.M.B. and C.K.), and by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (Grant No. 15-10279Y to M.S.).

For this Fe\u2013O bond distance, the excited dxz\u03c0* \u2192 dz2\u03c3* state (active in HAA) is calculated at the CASPT2 level of theory to lie ~ 10 000 cm-1 (~ 28 kcal mol-1) above the ground state minimum (Figure 8). This energy difference includes (i) the ground-state Fe\u2013O distortion that is associated with the energy increase by ~ 5000 cm-1 (~ 14 kcal mol-1) and (ii) the excitation from the ground state to the dxz\u03c0* \u2192 dz2\u03c3* state that requires an additional amount of ~ 14 kcal/mol. The difference of ~ 28 kcal mol-1 taken from Figure 8 relative to the DFT-calculated \u03c0-controlled HAA barrier of ~ 23 kcal mol-1 (\u0394E\u2021 for comparison to PES calculations) reflects the interaction of the FeIV\u2550O moiety with the substrate C\u2013H bond.J Am Chem Soc.

        "StatesAbstract Low temperature magnetic circular dichroism (LT MCD) spectroscopy in combination with quantum-chemical calculations are used to define the electronic structure associated with the geometric structure of the FeIV\u2550O intermediate in SyrB2 that was previously determined by nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy. These studies elucidate key frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and their contribution to H atom abstraction reactivity. The VT MCD spectra of the enzymatic S = 2 FeIV\u2550O intermediate with Br-ligation contain information-rich features that largely parallel the corresponding spectra of the S = 2 model complex (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (Srnec, M.; Wong, S. D.; England, J; Que, L; Solomon, E. I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2012, 109, 14326\u201314331). However, quantitative differences are observed that correlate with \u03c0-anisotropy and oxo donor strength that perturb FMOs and affect reactivity. Due to \u03c0-anisotropy, the FeIV\u2550O active site exhibits enhanced reactivity in the direction of the substrate cavity that proceeds through a \u03c0-channel that is controlled by perpendicular orientation of the substrate C\u2013H bond relative to the halide\u2013FeIV\u2550O plane. Also, the increased intrinsic reactivity of the SyrB2 intermediate relative to the ferryl model complex is correlated to a higher oxyl character of the FeIV\u2550O at the transition states resulting from the weaker ligand field of the",

        "INTRODUCTIONSyringomycin halogenase (SyrB2) is a member of the mononuclear nonheme iron (NHFe) enzymes family that activates 3O2, through formation of a key high-spin (S = 2) FeIV\u2550O intermediate, for H atom abstraction (HAA) from an unreactive C\u2013H bond to perform halogenation or hydroxylation.1 To date, six NHFe enzymatic FeIV\u2550O intermediates have been trapped and spectroscopically characterized mostly by using M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, five of which are \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) dependent (taurine dioxygenase (TauD),2,3 prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H),4 cytotrienin halogenase (CytC3),5,6 syringomicyn halogenase (SyrB2),1,7 carbapenem synthase (CarC)8) and the other two are pterin dependent (tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH)9 and phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH)10). In the catalytic cycle of SyrB2, for which the substrate-free crystal structure from ref 11 is displayed in Figure 1A, the halide atom is incorporated into the methyl group of the L-threonine ~ SyrB1 substrate (Figure 1B) in the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin syringomycin",
        "E.12NHFeIV\u2550O enzyme intermediates have stimulated synthetic efforts to prepare FeIV\u2550O compounds to elucidate crucial physicochemical factors that contribute to their reactivity in Nature.13 While most of the FeIV\u2550O model complexes have low-spin (S = 1) ground states,14 some models have the S = 2 spin state that is present in the enzymatic intermediates.15 A combined spectroscopic and computational study of one of the S = 2 model complexes, (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O,15a elucidated three reactive channels available for HAA: two are active when the C\u2013H bond is oriented perpendicular to the Fe\u2013oxo bond (\u03c0 channels leading to SFe = 5/2 or SFe = 3/2 FeIII\u2013OH intermediates) and one that is active for C\u2013H bonds oriented along the Fe\u2013oxo bond (\u03c3 channel providing an SFeIII = 5/2 intermediate).16 This is strikingly different from the S = 1 FeIV\u2550O complexes, which have only one available channel, \u03c0(SFeIII = 3/2).17 Thus, S = 2 active sites in NHFe enzymes have both \u03c0 and \u03c3 channels providing flexibility in using different substrate orientations to control selectivity.18 Note that the \u03c3-and \u03c0-channels for HAA reactivity of S = 1 and S = 2 NHFeIV\u2550O systems are also discussed in ref",

        "For the native L-threonine, L-Thr (and the alternative L-cyclopropylglycine, L-Cpg) substrate, this ferryl intermediate was shown to result from an O2 activation pathway that involves the two-electron reduction of dioxygen by the \u03b1KG-bound FeII center to generate an S = 1 peroxy-bridged \u03b1KG-bound FeIV species that undergoes a subsequent two-electron reduction through an S = 1\u2192 S = 2 oxidative decarboxylation of the \u03b1KG cofactor21 (summarized in Figure 1C). In the presence of the alternative substrate L-norvaline, L-Nva, the analogous O2 reaction pathway was proposed to lead to an FeIV\u2550O intermediate now with its Fe\u2013oxo bond oriented toward the C\u2013H bond of the substrate.

These become much more well-resolved and feature-rich in the LT MCD spectrum, which thus allows definitive band assignments for electronic-structure elucidation.",
        "First, within the theory developed in ref 36, fitting the temperature dependence of the MCD bands (data given in Figure 2B varying from T = 2 K through 60 K) allows an estimate of the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters that are D = +7 cm-1 and E/D = 0.02 for SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O (Figure S4). These parameters are in the range of those determined from magnetic M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the Cl\u2013FeIV\u2550O intermediate in halogenase CytC3 (D = +7 cm-1 and E/D = 0.02).5 Once the ZFS is known, the polarizations of the MCD bands can be determined using the methodology from refs 17, 37 (described in the caption to Figure S4). The positive ZFS D parameter gives the splitting of the \u00b1Ms sublevels of an S = 2 species with Ms = 0 lowest in energy. For a z-polarized transition, the lowest-energy sublevel at a magnetic field of 7T is the MCD-active Ms = -1, so the MCD intensity is high at low T and decreases with an increase in T because the population of the Ms = -1 sublevel decreases, and the populations of the MCD-inactive Ms = 0 and the opposite-signed Ms = +1 increase. For x/y-polarized transitions, the magnetic field has a nonvanishing component along the z axis for MCD intensity and the lowest sublevel at 7T is the MCD-inactive Ms = 0 sublevel. This leads to MCD intensity that decreases with increasing temperature at a lower rate than the z-polarized MCD intensity due to populations of the MCD-active Ms = +1 and Ms = -1 sublevels that produce MCD intensities of opposite signs (Figure",

        "(feature I in the MCD spectrum in Figure 2A). The temperature-dependent behavior of the pseudo-A term feature indicates that it is x/y-polarized (Figure S4). This transition has a fairly large MCD-to-absorption intensity (C0/D0) ratio (0.150) allowing it to be assigned as a ligand-field (LF) transition. The NIR VT MCD spectrum of the SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O intermediate is remarkably similar in terms of band energy, derivative band shape, C0/D0 ratio, and temperature dependence to the MCD spectrum of the S = 2 (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O model complex studied in ref 16 (and included for comparison in Figure 2B and Table 1). It is noteworthy that despite these similarities, the pseudo-A feature in Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O is approximately three times weaker than the equivalent MCD feature in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (its C0/D0 for feature I is ~ 0.250). Overall, these results allow assignment of the NIR MCD band I in (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O as the 5A \u2192 5E LF transition involving electron excitation from the dxz \u03c0* and dyz \u03c0* orbitals into the dz2 \u03c3* orbital, transitions that are degenerate in the C3 symmetry of",
        "(TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O.In the 15 000\u201330 000 cm-1 region of the MCD spectrum, there are four temperature-dependent MCD features located at ~ 17 500, ~ 21 500, ~ 24 000, and ~ 27 000 cm-1. The two lower-energy bands (labeled II and III in Figure 2A) are determined from the temperature-dependence MCD intensity (Figure S4) to be z-polarized C terms that can be assigned to charge-transfer (CT) transitions on the basis of their low C0/D0 ratios of 0.005 and 0.050, respectively. The two higher-energy MCD features at ~ 24000 and ~ 27000 cm-1 in Figure 2B cannot be analyzed because of a minor overlapping heme contaminant in the sample (that produces a large MCD contribution). As in the near-infrared region, the UV\u2013vis VT MCD spectra of SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O and (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (bands II and III from Figure 2A and B) have very similar spectroscopic characteristics including MCD signs, their",
        "the positive (i.e., left circularly polarized, LCP) and the negative (i.e., right circularly polarized, RCP) vibronic progressions were derived (Figure 3B). These parabolas are clearly different: the PES of the RCP state is broad and more distorted from the ground-state minimum and higher in energy at the ground-state equilibrium geometry than the PES for the LCP state. From these PESs, the RCP state becomes lower in energy at the longer Fe\u2013O bond lengths relevant to the TS of the \u03c0 channel for HAA (vide",
        "infra)There are thus quantitative differences in what was found from the MCD spectrum of the (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O species for the 5A \u2192 5E LF transitions relative to the results for (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O. For (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, the high-energy RCP component of the pseudo-A term in the NIR MCD spectrum had a smaller Huang\u2013Rhys factor and larger vibronic spacing (S = 1.2 and \u0394E = 880 cm-1)16 reflecting a narrower, less distorted PES for the RCP state as compared to the PES of the LCP state (S = 2.8 and \u0394E = 710 cm-1). This requires a significant difference in the nature of the interactions among the excited states that shape these 5E PESs. In the trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) C3 model complex (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, the high-energy, narrower, and less distorted RCP-active PES resulted from a strong spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) interaction between this component of the in-state SOC split 5E (dxz/yz \u03c0*\u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF) state and a nearby triplet.16 For SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O, it is the low-energy LCP PES that is narrower and less distorted. As explained below this results from a low-symmetry splitting of the dxz/yz \u03c0*\u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF 5E state, due to the presence of the equatorial halide ligand (Figure",
        "4).We finally note that the temperature-dependent MCD data for (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O in the band I region require more than two FC progressions. From the FC analysis presented in Figure 3A, the first, fourth, and the fifth negative peaks do not overlap with the LCP peaks and hence the intensities of these peaks should behave the same with a change of temperature. However, from Figure 5A, the temperature dependence of the first negative peak is different from that of the fourth and fifth negative peaks. This indicates that these peaks, in fact, belong to different RCP vibronic progressions. This is reflected in Figure 5B by a three FC progression fit of the pseudo-A term feature where the first (lower-energy) RCP progression has a distinctly larger S and smaller \u0394E than its high-energy RCP cognate. The origin of the two RCP progressions is evaluated in section",

These calculated transition energies are comparable to that of the corresponding 2-fold degenerate transition in the C3 symmetric (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O model complex, which also agrees with the experimental data in Figure",
        "2B.We next consider the CT spectrum of (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O. From group theory for effective C3 symmetry, three oxo \u03c0 \u2192 dxz,yz \u03c0* CT transitions are predicted: one is 2-fold degenerate (5E) and x/y-polarized, while two are nondegenerate (5A) and z-polarized. The same is predicted for the oxo \u03c0 \u2192 Fe dxy/x2-y2 CT transitions. According to the nonrelativistic multiconfigurational calculations for (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, the lowest-energy CT state is the oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* 5E state at ~ 24 630 cm-1, whereas the two other oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* states (the 5A\u2019s) are at ~ 25 040 and ~ 31 290 cm-1 (Figure 6). The three oxo \u03c0 \u2192 Fe dxy/x2-y2 CT states in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (labeled oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d) are calculated at ~ 27 880, ~ 29 930, and ~ 31 290 cm-1, respectively (Figure 6); the first is z-polarized and has the largest oscillator strength among all of excitations in the 0\u201332 000 cm-1 region. This lowest oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d CT is attributed to the intense band III in the experimental spectrum of the model complex in Figure 2B. While the lowest-energy experimental CT transition, i.e., band II in the MCD spectrum of the model compound Figure 2B, is z-polarized (Table 1), the lowest calculated oxo-to-Fe CT transition (5Ags \u2192 5E CT) in the model in Figure 6 is x/y-polarized. This discrepancy can be reconciled by the fact that the lowest-energy calculated z-polarized nondegenerate oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* CT transition (5Ags \u2192 5A CT) is predicted only 500 cm-1 above the 5Ags \u2192 5E CT. This z-polarized oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* CT (~ 25 040 cm-1) has 5A symmetry and can undergo configuration interaction with the most intense z-polarized oxo \u03c0 \u2192 Fe d CT (band III). Even a few percent CI mixing would produce significant z-polarized intensity and give rise to band II in Abs and MCD spectra of the ferryl model compound (Figure",
        "2B).Taking advantage of the analysis of the oxo-to-Fe CTs in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O, the eight calculated lowest-energy low-symmetry split CT transitions for the SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O active site can be straightforwardly identified. The calculated transitions at ~ 21 040 and ~ 23 140 cm-1 are the low-symmetry split components of the lowest-energy 2-fold degenerate x/y-polarized oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* CT (Figure 6, red). However, these two excitations are masked by the more intense z-polarized transitions, oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* CT calculated at ~ 21 760 cm-1 and oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d at ~ 23 220 cm-1 (bold red lines in Figure 6), that correlate with the first and the second 5Ags \u2192 5A CT in the C3-symmetric (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O complex, respectively. Thus, bands II and III in the experimental spectrum of (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O in Figure 2A can be assigned as the oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d\u03c0* and oxo \u03c0 \u2192 d CT transitions,",

This energy difference is due to the dyz \u03c0* orbital that interacts with the halide and is at higher energy than dxz \u03c0* and thus lowering the energy of the dyz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* state relative to the dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* transition.

It is noteworthy that calculated SOC interaction between LCP and RCP states is ~ 120 cm-1 in SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O, which is smaller than SOC between the corresponding states in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (~ 220 cm-1);16 this is in line with the observation of lower pseudo-A term MCD intensity (and lower C0/D0 ratio) for the Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O species than for (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (cf., Figure 2 and Table 1). This decreased SOC indicates a larger relativistic nephelauxetic effect due to the higher covalency of the Fe\u2013oxo bond relative to the N-based chelating ligation in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (vide",
        "infra).To further correlate calculations with the experimental data, the CASPT2 ground-state and two lowest excited-state PESs in the Fe\u2013oxo coordinate were evaluated (Figure 8). Importantly, the excited-state PESs reproduce the main features of the MCD-derived PESs (from Figure 3B): (i) the LCP-active PES is lower in energy at ground-state equilibrium than RCP-active PES (quantitatively the calculations overestimate the experiment by a factor of ~ 2 that corresponds to an error of ~ 1.5 kcal mol-1); (ii) the LCP-state distortion is smaller than that of the RCP state, \u0394QLCP = 0.095 \u00c5 vs \u0394QRCP = 0.124 \u00c5 (cf., experimental values in Figure 3B); (iii) the RCP PES decreases in energy more than the LCP PES in going from the ground-state equilibrium (indicated by a vertical line in Figure 8) to their respective excited-state PES minima; (iv) the frequency of the LCP state Fe\u2013oxo stretching mode",

        "3B).The different PES curvatures and distortions of the LCP and RCP states in the vicinity of the ground-state equilibrium are attributed to the anisotropy of the \u03c0 FMOs. Namely, the p orbitals of the Br-ligand interact with dyz \u03c0* (y along Fe\u2013Br, vide supra; orbitals shown in Figure 8) but not with dxz \u03c0*. As a consequence, the dyz \u03c0* has less Fe d character than dxz",

        "3.3.1. Configuration Evolution of FMOs\u2014From section 3.2.1, the calculations correlated with spectroscopy show the oxo-to-Fe CT states to be lower in energy in SyrB2 Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O than those in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O. This reflects larger CI mixing of the oxo-to-Fe (py \u03c0 \u2192 dyz \u03c0* and px \u03c0 \u2192 dxz \u03c0*) CT configurations into the dyz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* and dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF states at the ground-state equilibrium geometry of (SyrB2)-FeIV\u2550O as compared to (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O (cf., ~ 40% vs ~ 20% CT admixtures into the dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF state; Figure 10). This is consistent with the more covalent Fe\u2013O bond in SyrB2 than that in TMG3tren. From Figure 10, in passing from the ground-state equilibrium to the transition-state Fe\u2013O bond lengths, the dashed line representing the oxyl FeIII character evolves more rapidly for the enzyme than for the model complex (cf. ~ 65% vs ~ 35% of FeIII\u2014O\u2022-admixtures into the dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF state at the TS Fe\u2013O lengths in Figure 10). While both \u03c0* FMOs in TMG3tren remain equivalent along the Fe\u2013O reaction coordinate (i.e., oxyl character in both \u03c0 directions evolves equally), the \u03c0-anisotropy in SyrB2 leads at longer Fe\u2013O distances to the increased oxyl character oriented in the direction of the substrate (cf. 60% of \u03c0yz-oxyl vs 65% of \u03c0xz-oxyl at the TS; Figure S5). This correlates with the difference in halide donation to dyz \u03c0* relative to the dxz \u03c0* orbital; the latter thus undergoes more FeIV\u2550O \u2192 FeIII\u2013oxyl polarization at the TS (section 3.2.2).",
        "In correlating from the spectroscopic analysis to reactivity, only the LF RCP-active state, corresponding to the dxz \u03c0* FMO, is involved in the HAA \u03c0 pathway, as this is oriented toward the substrate cavity. While this state is higher in energy than the LCP dyz \u03c0* state in ground-state equilibrium geometry, it has a softer PES in the Fe\u2013O bond (Figure 8) and becomes lower in energy at Fe\u2013O lengths (i.e., >1.82 \u00c5) corresponding to the transition state for C\u2013H",
        "abstraction.Finally, in analogy to the MCD study in ref 16, it is noteworthy that for SyrB2 halide\u2013FeIV\u2550O there are two additional S = 2 (ground and the lowest-energy oxo-to-Fe CT) states capable of an H atom abstraction. However, in contrast to TMG3tren, these two states associated with one \u03c3 and one \u03c0(SFeIII = 3/2) HAA channels are not operative in SyrB2. First, the \u03c3-channel that is associated with d\u03c3* FMO is excluded due to the perpendicular orientation of the substrate with respect to the Fe\u2013O vector (Figure 9A). Second, in comparison to TMG3tren, the PES of the lowest-energy oxo-to-Fe CT state in SyrB2 (Figure S8) is less distorted and steeper at longer Fe\u2013O distances so that it becomes higher in energy for Fe\u2013O lengths of >1.9 \u00c5. This indicates that the \u03c0(SFeIII = 3/2)-channel for HAA is less accessible in SyrB2 than that in (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O. This difference in PES curvature is attributed to a difference in H-bonding to the oxo moiety by its environment (two H-bonds in SyrB2 vs no H-bond in TMG3tren, Figure",

Experimentally, for methyl groups of small molecules representing threonine (2-propanol) and the chelate ligand (trimethylamine), these are 947 and 86 \u00b1 238 kcal mol-1, respectively. The calculated difference using the present methodology is 10 kcal mol-1. The fact that (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O is capable of an H atom abstraction from a stronger C\u2013H bond with a lower reaction barrier suggests that the enzyme is more reactive in HAA than its synthetic",
        "counterpart.DFT calculations are consistent with the experimental results (Table 2): the barrier of the \u03c0(SFeIII = 5/2)-controlled HAA reaction in SyrB2, calculated for the cluster model in the absence of the second-shell Arg residue (see footnote in Table 2), is lower than the corresponding pathway in the model complex (cf., \u0394G\u2260 19.8 vs 21.4 kcal mol-1; TSs shown in Figure S9; for \u03c0-trajectories in SyrB2 vs TMG3tren, see Figure 9) despite its larger endergonicity (cf., \u0394G\u00b0 2.3 vs 0.5 kcal mol-1). The fact that the thermodynamically less favorable reaction is kinetically more feasible indicates an increased intrinsic reactivity of the enzyme system. Indeed, elimination of the effect of the thermodynamic driving force on the reaction barrier through Marcus theory gives an intrinsic barrier \u0394G\u2260intr (=[\u0394G\u2260 -1/2\u0394G\u00b0 + (\u0394G\u22602 -\u0394G\u2260\u0394G\u00b0)1/2]/2)39 of 18.6 (SyrB2) and 21.6 kcal mol-1 (TMG3tren). The lowered intrinsic barrier for \u03c0-controlled HAA in the enzyme correlates well with the increased \u03c0-oxyl character of enzymatic FeIV\u2550O relative to the model ferryl complex at the TS that was revealed by the spectrocopically supported calculations of the lowest excited state in section",

        "DISCUSSIONThis study on SyrB2 has focused on using MCD spectroscopy to determine the electronic structure of the FeIV\u2550O intermediate based on its geometric structure from NRVS in ref 20 and quantitative comparisons to studies on TMG3tren.16 Importantly, there are strong parallels to the MCD spectra of the (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O model complex (i.e., energies and signs of MCD bands, and related spectroscopic characteristics including C0/D0 ratios, ground-state ZFS and polarizations of the electronic transitions) that confirm the ~ C3 TBP arrangement of the FeIV\u2550O site in SyrB2 and allow us to define its ground and low-lying excited electronic states that relate to its FMOs. However, the comparison also reveals differences: the oxo \u03c0\u2192 d\u03c0* CT transitions are shifted down in energy in SyrB2, the C0/D0 ratio for band I is reduced by a factor of ~ 2, and the vibronic structure in the ~ 12 000 cm-1 (pseudo-A) band I, assigned as the pair of d\u03c0* \u2192 d\u03c3* LF transitions, is different. These observations reflect quantitative differences in the FMOs. The lower-energy CT reflects a smaller energy gap between oxo px/y and dxz/yz \u03c0* orbitals indicating a greater oxo donor interaction reflecting a weaker donor ligand set for the SyrB2 active site. This is also consistent with the lower C0/D0 ratio of feature I in Br\u2013FeIV\u2550O relative to (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O as this increased oxo character lowers the SOC. The change in vibronic structure indicates a \u03c0 anisotropy in SyrB2 due to the equatorial halide ligand (Scheme 1A and B), i.e., a low-symmetry splitting of the dxz \u03c0* and dyz \u03c0* orbitals with dxz \u03c0* being nonbonding with the Br-(Scheme 1C). This \u03c0 anisotropy results in different shapes of the PESs along the Fe\u2013oxo stretching coordinate. This leads to a lowest-energy dxz \u03c0* FMO orbital at longer Fe\u2013O distances that is oriented toward the substrate cavity (Scheme",

This allows a correlation of the spectroscopic data with the reactivity of the SyrB2 FeIV\u2550O intermediate. The decrease in energy between the oxo-based \u03c0 and Fe-dxz/yz \u03c0* orbitals results in their larger CI admixture into the d\u03c0* \u2192 d\u03c3* LF states. This facilitates spin polarization in the Fe\u2013oxo bond and increases its FeIII(SFe = 5/2)\u2013oxyl character at the TS, compared to (TMG3tren)-FeIV\u2550O. Also, due to the \u03c0 anisotropy associated with the equatorial halide there are differences in strength and distortion of the Fe\u2013oxo bond between the RCP dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF and LCP dyz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF states (Scheme 1B and C). The RCP dxz \u03c0* \u2192 dz2 \u03c3* LF state, active in \u03c0-controlled H atom abstraction due to its orientation toward the C\u2013H bond, has a weaker, more distorted Fe\u2013oxo bond. Thus, the dxz \u03c0* state becomes lower in energy at Fe\u2013O lengths relevant to the TS and hence has increased HAA reactivity in the direction of the substrate cavity (Scheme 1B and",

The comparison with the model complex (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O reveals that the FeIV\u2550O enzymatic intermediate is intrinsically more \u03c0-reactive due to its higher oxyl character and lower Fe\u2013oxo stretching frequency as observed by MCD",

        "CONCLUSIONSThis study used low-temperature MCD spectroscopy to define the electronic structure of the S = 2 (SyrB2)FeIV\u2550O intermediate, for which the 5C TBP geometric structure was previously determined by NRVS. The VT MCD spectra, obtained for this SyrB2 NHFeIV\u2550O intermediate, show features that largely parallel those observed for the TBP S = 2 (TMG3tren)FeIV\u2550O model complex and provide significant insight into the low-lying S = 2 excited states and the associated FMOs. The comparison of SyrB2 FeIV\u2550O with (TMG3tren)-FeIV\u2550O further allows evaluation of the oxo\u2013Fe bonding and the low-symmetry effects due to a halide on the nature of the FMOs (potential energy surfaces of low-lying S = 2 states). This increased oxo character and \u03c0-anisotropy enhance the HAA reactivity along the direction of the substrate. The H atom abstraction pathway occurs through a \u03c0 channel leading to the TBP halide\u2013FeIII(S = 5/2)\u2013OH",

For the energetics of the Arg-including cluster model of the active site from Figure 9, see Table S1.b Calculated at the same level of theory as SyrB2 (described in Computational Details) but with a dielectric constant of \u03b5 = 35.7 mimicking the solvation effect of acetonitrile.c The Fe\u2013O bond length at the TS for HAA is ~ 1.8 \u00c5 (Figure S9). For this Fe\u2013O bond distance, the excited dxz\u03c0* \u2192 dz2\u03c3* state (active in HAA) is calculated at the CASPT2 level of theory to lie ~ 10 000 cm-1 (~ 28 kcal mol-1) above the ground state minimum (Figure 8). This energy difference includes (i) the ground-state Fe\u2013O distortion that is associated with the energy increase by ~ 5000 cm-1 (~ 14 kcal mol-1) and (ii) the excitation from the ground state to the dxz\u03c0* \u2192 dz2\u03c3* state that requires an additional amount of ~ 14 kcal/mol. The difference of ~ 28 kcal mol-1 taken from Figure 8 relative to the DFT-calculated \u03c0-controlled HAA barrier of ~ 23 kcal mol-1 (\u0394E\u2021 for comparison to PES calculations) reflects the interaction of the FeIV\u2550O moiety with the substrate C\u2013H",
