The optimum pHs of the enzymes from coralline algae were around 6.0. The enzymes were specific for I -and Br -, and did not act on CI-and F -. The enzymes purified from Corallina pilulifera and Amphiroa ephedraea catalyzed the brominations of phenol and o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol in the presence of Br -and H20 2 to form the same product, 2,4,6-tribromophenol. 2961 Haloperoxidases catalyze the halogenation of various compounds.1)The chloroperoxidase purified from Caldariomyces jumago, has been studied since 19592,3); it introduces iodine, bromine and chlorine atoms into organic com-pounds through an electrophilic substi-tution4 ,S) or addition mechanism.6 ) In our pre-vious paper,7) we also described .an addition reaction catalyzed by the C. jumago enzyme: halogenation of several 2,3-unsaturated car-boxylic acids such as trans-cinnamic acid and its derivatives. Antibacterial halocompounds like bromo-phenols have been isolated from many ma-rine algae.8 \"-'11) Enzymes that halogenate or-ganic compounds have been found in marine algae,12,13) and bromoperoxidases have been purified from Rhodomela larix,13) Rhipoce-phalus phoenix,14) Penicillus lamourouxii14) and Penicillus capitatus. 14 ,lS) In the course of our study of haloper-oxidases, we found coralline algae with high bromoperoxidase activity. This paper de-scribes some properties of bromoperoxidases of coralline algae including the bromination of phenol derivatives by the enzymes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Collection ofalgae. Various algae including 42 species of 34 genera were collected from shallow water (0.5\", 2.0 m deep) on the shores of Suzuka (Mie Prefecture), Miyazu (Kyoto Prefecture), Shirahama (Wakayama Prefecture) and Hakodate (Hokkaido) in Japan from March to June in 1984. The samples, in ice-cold boxes, were immediately sent to our laboratory at Kyoto University, and their bromoperoxidase activity was assayed. The rest of the algal samples were stored frozen at -20\u00b0C. Crude enzyme preparation. Each sample of alga was briefly washed with cold water and dried by pressing between paper towels. Five hundred milligrams of alga was disrupted with sea sand (40\", 80 mesh) in a chilled mortar and extracted with 4 ml of 50 mM potassium phos-phate buffer (pH 6.5). Enzyme assay. Bromoperoxidase activity was spectro-photometrically assayed at 25\u00b0C by measuring the change in absorbance at 290 nm due to the change of monochloro-dimedone (8= 19,900M-1 cm-1 at pH 6.0)to monobromo-monochlorodimedone., The standard assay mixture con-tained 100 )lmol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 20 )lmol of potassium bromide, 2 )lmol of hydrogen per-oxide, 60 nmol of monochlorodimedone and a suitable amount of enzyme solution in a total volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was started by adding\u00b7 hydrogen\u00b7 peroxide. One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1)lmol of monobromomonochlorodimedone in one min under the standard assay conditions. 2962 H. YAMADA et af. The oxidation of iodide was measured at 350 nm by a modification of the method of Hosoya.16) The standard assay mixture contained 100 Jimol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 5 Jimol of potassium iodide, 400 nmol hydrogen peroxide and a suitable amount of enzyme solution in a total volume of 1.0 ml. A blank test was done without enzyme to compensate the oxidation of iodide by hydrogen peroxide. Catalase activity was measured at 240 nm by a modifi-cation of the method of Beers et al. 17 ) The reaction mixture consisted of 150 Jimol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 60 Jimol of hydrogen peroxide and a suitable amount of enzyme solution in a total volume of 3.0 ml. Protein measurement. Protein concentrations were mea-sured using the absorbance at 280 nm or by the method of Lowry et al. 18 ) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzymatic reaction for the isolation of products from phenol compounds.. The reaction mixture for the isolation of the products from phenol or o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol consisted of 10 mmol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 4 m\u00b7mol of potassium bromide, 2 mmol of hydrogen peroxide, 2 mmol of each substrate and 100 units of bromoperoxidase in a total volume of 100 ml. The reaction was started by adding 0.5 mmol of hydrogen peroxide at 10-min intervals, and the mixture was kept at 30\u00b0C for 2 hr. A blank test was also performed without enzyme. Reaction mixture analysis. The reaction mixture was extracted with the same volume of ethyl acetate and samples of the ethyl acetate layer (10\"\" 20 Jil) were put on silica gel thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. TLC was done with the following solvent systems (by volume): (a) benzene-n-hexane, 7: 3, (b) benzene-ethyl acetate, 9: 1, (c) benzene, (d) benzene--ethyl acetate-methanol, 4: 1 : 1. The products and subst,rates were detected by ultraviolet-light-absorbing spots. Product analysis. 1 H-NMR spectra were recorded with a JEOL-FXI00 (100 MHz) spectrometer with tetramethyl-silane as a reference. In Beam-electron impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS) was performed at 20 eV with a JEOL JMS-DX 300 mass spectrometer. Chemicals. o-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol was bought from Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., U.S.A. and p-hydroxybenzal-dehyde from Nakarai Chemicals Ltd., Japan. Thin layer chromatoplates (TLC plates, Silica gel 60 F254) were supplied by \"Merck Japan Ltd., Japan. DEAE~Sepharose CL-4B was obtained from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Sweden. All other reagents used in this study were com-mercial products of analytical grade. RESULTS Distribution of bromoperoxidase in algae As shown in Table I, bromoperoxidase ac-tivities were measured for 42 algal samples, including 34 genera, which were collected from the seasides of Japan. All the coralline algae tested contained some of the enzyme. High specific activities were observed in Anlphiroa zonata and Amphiroa ephedraea, and high total activities in Corallina officinalis and Corallina pilulipera. Detectable activities were observed in Gelidium amansii, Hypnea chararoides, Neodilsea yendoana and Codium fragile except coralline algae. Figure 1 shows photographs of eight coralline algae with high enzyme activities. pH optima of bromoperoxidases of coralline algae The activity of the bromoperoxidases were measured as a function of pH for the coralline algal extracts, as shown in Fig. 2. The enzymes from these eight coralline algae all had pH optima near 6.0. Halide ion specificity The halide ion specificity of the eight coral-line algal extracts was examined. The spe-cificity of the enzymes for F-, CI-and Br-was assayed by the monochlorodimedone method, and that for I -was measured by the formation of I;. The results are given in Table II. These enzymes were specific for Br-and 1-.

Step 1. Crude extract preparation. Each of the frozen algae (about 330 g wet weight) was suspended in 150 ml of 0.1 M potassium phos-phate butTer (pH 6.5) and disrupted with a Hitachi VA 895 blender mixer for 15 min. After disruption, the debris was removed by centrifugation (8,000 x g, 20 min). Step 2. Ammonium sulfate precipitation. The crude extract was brought to 80% satu-ration with ammonium sulfate. After gentle stirring for 12 hr, the precipitate was harvested by centrifugation (9,000 x g, 20 min). The pre-cipitate was dissolved in a minimal volume of 50 mM potassium phosphate butTer (pH 6.0), and dialyzed against 10 liters of the above butTer containing 50 mM ammonium sulfate. After dialysis, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (9,000 x g, 20 min). Step 3. DEAE-Sepharose column chroma-tography. The enzyme solution was put on a DEAE-Sepharose column (4.4 x 20cm) equi-librated with the dialysis butTer. The col-umn was washed with the same butTer and the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate to 1.0 M (Fig. 3). Fractions with high enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated by salting out with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (9,000 x g, 20 min), dissolved in 50 mM potassium phosphate butTer (pH 7.0), and dialyzed against the same butTer. By these procedures, 1,960 U of the enzyme were obtained from 1 kg of C. pilulifera (yield, 27%) and 580 U of the enzyme from 0.45 kg of A. ephedraea (yield, 57%). The enzymes were used for the bromination of phenol derivatives in the following experiments. Enzymatic bromination oj'phenol compounds The bromoperoxidases of C. pilulifera and A. ephedraea acted on phenol and 0-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, but p-hydroxybenzal-dehyde did not serve as a substrate of the enzymes.

The EI-MS spectra of the product (Fig. 5) had molecular ion peaks split into 1 : 3 : 3 : 1 distribution due to the isotopes of three bromine atoms. The NMR spectra and melting point (lit. 87 t'oI 89\u00b0C)19) were identical with authentic 2,4,6-tribromo-phenol. Hence, the product was. identified as 2,4,6-tribromophenol. Isolation and identification of the product from o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol For the isolation and identification .. of the product fromo-hydroxybenzyl alcohol as well, the reaction was done under the same con-ditions as for phenol. The product was ex-tracted twice with 150 ml of ethyl acetate each time. The ethyl acetate layer was dried with Na2S04, evaporated, and the product was subjected to silica gel chromatography (Ix 70cm column) with. solvent (d) as an eluent. The product. was put on TLC pl'l;tes and developed with benzene, and then extract-ed with ethyl acetate from the spot band (Rf= 0.8). The product was rechromato-graphed by TLC under the same conditions. By this method, 53 mg of faint yellowish pow-derwas obtained:mp 86~i87\u00b0C, IHNMR (CDCI3)<5 5.88 (lH, s,-OH) 7.58 (2H, s, ArH), EI-MS m/e (M+ 328, 330, 332, 334). The melting point, NMR spectra and EI-MS spectra were identical with the product from phenol and \u00b72,4,6-tribromophenol. Hence, the p;roduct from o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol was identified as 2,4,6-tribromophenoL It in-dicated that the hydroxymethyl group was also replaced by bromine in the enzynie re-action. DISCUSSION Haloperoxidase is an interesting enzyme that halogenates many compounds including substituted phenols,4,20) {J-diketones,3) ., al-kene,6) alkyne,21) steroids22 ,23) and several (X,{J-unsaturated carboxylic acids.7) Because of the natural occurrence of halocompounds, halo-peroxidase has been of interest in recent years. The enzyme has been reported in\u00b7 only two microorganisms, Caldariomyces fumago2) and Streptomyces phaeochromogenes,24) and a few algae including Penicillus,14,15) Rhipo-cephalusl4) and Rhodomela. 13 ) This paper is the first report that coralline algae contain large amounts ofbromoperox.idase. More than 10 units of the enzyme per g of wet alga was observed in Corallina officinalis and Corallina pilulifera. Coralline algae are widely distrib-uted in the seashores of the world, not only in Japan but also southern Australia, western North America and eastern South Africa. Corallina pilulifera occurs in all the costal areas in Japan.25) Thus, Corallina pilulifera seems .to be an excellent source of bromo-peroxidae. The properties of the enzymes extracted from the eight coralline algae shown in Table I were quite similar. The optimal pHs of the enzymes were around 6.0. The chloroper-o~idase of C. fumago and bromoperoxi-dases of Rodomela larix and Penicillus capi-tatus have their maximum activities in more acidic pHs, pH 2.75 for C. fumago,2) pH 4.4 for R. larix,t3) and pH 4.0 for P. capitatus. 14) As for optimal 'bromide ion concentration, the enzymes of coralline algae were most active at higher concentration than 75 mM. But Hager et al. reported that the -enzyme of P. capitatus was not saturated with bromide ion even at concentrations above 1.0M.IS) With the enzymes of. coralline algat1, the optimum H20 2 concentration was approx-imately betweenO.25t'o15.0mM. This value is higher than those for the other reported haloperoxidases, 0.25 mM for R. phoenix and 0.125\u00b7mM for P. capitatua. 14) Compared with these other enzymes, the enzymes of coralline algae seem to be very resistant to the inhibitory effect of peroxide. Manley et al. suggested that brominated phenols were synthesized from L-tyrosine in cell-fret} homogenates of Odonthalia fioccosa (Rhodophyceae).12) Ahern et al. also reported that brominated compounds were: detected in the products fromp-hydroxybenzyLalcohol by Bromoperoxidase of Coralline Algae 2967 the enzyme of R. larix. 13 ) But the pathway of synthesis of bromophenols in algae is not known. We have shown that phenol com-pounds such as phenol and o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol were suitable substrates of bromoper-oxidase from coralline algae, so the partici-pation of bromoperoxidase in the production of bromophenols in nature is possible. The physiological function of halocompounds in marine organisms and ocean environment is unknown. Detailed properties of the enzyme ofC. pi/ulifera will be reported elsewhere. Acknowledgments.

        "DISCUSSION",
        "Haloperoxidase is an interesting enzyme that halogenates many compounds including substituted phenols,4,20) {J-diketones,3) ., al-kene,6) alkyne,21) steroids22 ,23) and several (X,{J-unsaturated carboxylic acids.7) Because of the natural occurrence of halocompounds, halo-peroxidase has been of interest in recent years. The enzyme has been reported in\u00b7 only two microorganisms, Caldariomyces fumago2) and Streptomyces phaeochromogenes,24) and a few algae including Penicillus,14,15) Rhipo-cephalusl4) and Rhodomela. 13 ) This paper is the first report that coralline algae contain large amounts ofbromoperox.idase. More than 10 units of the enzyme per g of wet alga was observed in Corallina officinalis and Corallina pilulifera. Coralline algae are widely distrib-uted in the seashores of the world, not only in Japan but also southern Australia, western North America and eastern South Africa. Corallina pilulifera occurs in all the costal areas in Japan.25) Thus, Corallina pilulifera seems .to be an excellent source of bromo-peroxidae.",
        "The properties of the enzymes extracted from the eight coralline algae shown in Table I were quite similar. The optimal pHs of the enzymes were around 6.0. The chloroper-o~idase of C. fumago and bromoperoxi-dases of Rodomela larix and Penicillus capi-tatus have their maximum activities in more acidic pHs, pH 2.75 for C. fumago,2) pH 4.4 for R. larix,t3) and pH 4.0 for P. capitatus. 14)",
        "As for optimal 'bromide ion concentration, the enzymes of coralline algae were most active at higher concentration than 75 mM. But Hager et al. reported that the -enzyme of P. capitatus was not saturated with bromide ion even at concentrations above 1.0M.IS)",
        "With the enzymes of. coralline algat1, the optimum H20 2 concentration was approx-imately betweenO.25t'o15.0mM. This value is higher than those for the other reported haloperoxidases, 0.25 mM for R. phoenix and 0.125\u00b7mM for P. capitatua. 14) Compared with these other enzymes, the enzymes of coralline algae seem to be very resistant to the inhibitory effect of peroxide.",
        "Manley et al. suggested that brominated phenols were synthesized from L-tyrosine in cell-fret} homogenates of Odonthalia fioccosa (Rhodophyceae).12) Ahern et al. also reported that brominated compounds were: detected in the products fromp-hydroxybenzyLalcohol by",
