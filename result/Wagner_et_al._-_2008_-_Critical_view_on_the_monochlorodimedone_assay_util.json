Haloperoxidase (HPO) activity within F. ambigua was therefore assayed spectro-photometrically by using monochlorodimedone (MCD) during protein purification. This strategy revealed the isolation of a protein posi-tive in the MCD-assay, but an involvement in halogenating processes could not be verified. N-terminal sequencing rather demonstrated homology to cytochrome c6 from other cyanobacteria and green algae. From our findings it thus has to be concluded that the spectro-photometrical MCD-assay routinely used to detect HPO activity may yield false positive results, mainly since the assay focuses on the decline of the educt and not on the formation of the product. Our data indicate that the reaction of MCD with proteins of the cyto-chrome c\u2013 family leads to unspecific products. None 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction Natural products are a significant source for innovative therapeutics and play an essential role in ecological pro-cesses. In the area of cancer and infective disease treatment up to 75% of the available drugs originate from natural sources (Gullo et al., 2006). Ecologically, natural chemicals are important in interactions within and between organ-isms (Keller and Surette, 2006). The current study aimed at identifying the halogenating enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the cyanobacterial metabolites ambigol A, B, C and tjipanazole D from Fischerella ambigua (Fig. 1), for which antimicrobial activ-ities have been reported (Falch et al., 1993; Wright et al., 2005).

Ko\u0308nig). which might have altered bioactivities (Hofrichter and Ull-rich, 2006; Kling et al., 2005; Murphy, 2006; van Pee, 1996). In nature halogenated metabolites are widely spread and show varied biological activities. Around 4000 organohal-ogen compounds are known to be produced by living organisms (Anderson and Chapman, 2006; Gribble, 2003). Most of these biogenic organohalogens are mar-ine-derived and proposed to serve as antifeedant or anti-bacterial defense mechanisms. Besides simple haloalkanes like chloroform, bromoform, CH2Br2 or CHBr2CI, partic-ularly released by Phaeophytae, complex halogenated metabolites are known, such as terpenes and acetogenins from e.g., Laurencia species (Gross and Ko\u0308nig, 2006). Metabolites found in marine sponges, including haloge-nated fatty acids, indoles and phenolic derivatives, are often ascribable to associated microorganisms, including cyanobacteria (Ko\u0308nig et al., 2006) (Fig. 2).

Wagner et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 323\u2013332 derivatives (Becher et al., 2005; Bonjouklian et al., 1991; Falch et al., 1995) as well as the aliphatically chlorinated compounds barbamide (Orjala and Gerwick, 1996) or nor-dysidin (Jimenez and Scheuer, 2001) have been found in cyanobacteria. Due to the wide distribution of halogenated natural compounds, enzymes involved in biohalogenation were dis-covered from a broad range of organisms, including fungi, algae and bacteria. Halogenating enzymes are mainly grouped into two classes: haloperoxidases (HPO) and halogenases (Kling et al., 2005). HPOs were shown to be less specific, whereas halogenases could be demonstrated to be highly substrate specific (Kling et al., 2005; van Pee and Patallo, 2006). More recently, the group of a-ketoglu-tarate-O2-dependent halogenases were shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of halogen incorporation in aliphatic moieties, as in syringomycin E or barbamide (Fig. 1) (Flatt et al., 2006; Murphy, 2006; Vaillancourt C. Wagner et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 323\u2013332 325 et al., 2005). Furthermore, methyltransferases have been described to be involved in the formation of carbon halo-gen bonds of CH3Cl, CH3Br and CH3I (Ballschmiter, 2003; van Pee et al., 2006). HPOs generate hypohalous acid which in most cases is released from the enzyme to halogenate organic substrates. The enzymes are found to contain either heme or vanadate as cofactor in the active site. The first halogenating enzyme was described from the caldariomycin-producing fungus Caldariomyces fumago as a heme containing HPO (Morris and Hager, 1966) and later several heme-HPOs were dis-covered from diverse fungi, algae and microorganisms.

Vanadate ion containing bromoperoxidases (Va-BrPO) have been isolated mainly from marine algae.

Wagner et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 323\u2013332 terpenes (Carter-Franklin et al., 2003). The substrate chan-nel leading to the vanadium binding site is proposed to influence substrate specificity. In absence of the suitable substrate however, HOBr released from the enzyme carries out unselective bromination as observed for aqueous bro-mine. Asymmetric bromination and cyclization of the ter-penoid precursor (E)-(+)-nerolidol could be demonstrated for Va-BrPO, producing single diastereomers of the marine natural products a-and b-snyderol, as isolated from Lau-rencia obtusa (Butler and Carter-Franklin, 2004; Carter-Franklin and Butler, 2004). The first Va-BrPO to be char-acterized was the one of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum (Vilter, 1984). However, with the isolation of a Va-BrPO from the lichen Xanthoria parietina it became obvious, that this group of enzymes not only occurs in marine environments, but can also be found in terrestrial eukaryotic organisms (Plat et al., 1987). Va-chloroperoxidases on the other hand have been found essentially in fungi. To date it has not been proven that chloroperoxidases (CPO), heme as well as vanadate containing, are involved in the biosynthesis of halogenated secondary metabolites. Excreted by terrestrial fungi, their physiological function is rather discussed to be important for the degradation of plant cell walls. The produced hyp-ohalorous acid facilitates penetration of the fungal hyphen into the host (Wever and Hemrika, 2001). HPOs have been isolated by classical protein purifica-tion in combination with functional assays. The most applied assay uses monochlorodimedone (MCD) as a syn-thetic substrate for the potential halogenating enzyme. MCD is discussed as a mimic of the natural precursor of caldariomycin, the chlorinated compound isolated from C. fumago (Hager et al., 1966). The method is based on the conversion of the monohalogenated diketone MCD to a dihalogenated product (Fig. 3). This can be easily monitored spectrophotometrically by the decrease in UV absorption, which is directly proportional to the enzymatic activity. The MCD-assay became the routinely used analytical method for identifying HPOs and for characterizing their halogenating activity (van Pee et al., 2006; Wever and OO Cl OHO Cl HPO + H2O + R -monochlorodimedone (MCD)OO Cl C HO intermediate incaldariomycin biosynthesiscalda Caldario HPO Fig. 3. Monochloro Hemrika, 2001). In this enzymatically initiated reaction the actual halogenation is catalyzed unspecifically via free diffusible hypohalous acid and therefore, on substrates gen-erally susceptible to halogenation, similar patterns of halo-genation are observable as reported for non-enzymatic reactions with hypohalous acid in free solution. The intention of the current study was to use the MCD-assay in order to detect enzymes responsible for the bio-halogenation of ambigol A, B, C and tjipanazole D precur-sors. To date little is known concerning biohalogenation processes in cyanobacteria (Welker and von Do\u0308hren, 2006). HPO activity has only been shown for the multifunc-tional enzyme KatG from Synechocystis PCC 6803 (Jako-pitsch et al., 2001), while no Va-BrPO could be identified from cyanobacterial species yet (Welker and von Do\u0308hren, 2006). A FADH2-dependent halogenase (ApdC) has been characterized from Anabaena strain 90, producing the cyc-lic depsipeptides anabaenopeptilides (Rouhiainen et al., 2000), and another putative FADH2-dependent halogenase in the cyanopeptolin-cluster of Microcystis cf. wesenbergii N-C 172/5 (Tooming-Klunderud et al., 2007). Two a-keto-glutarate-O2-dependent halogenases (BarB1, BarB2) have been identified to act in a tandem to incorporate the halo-gen atoms during barbamide biosynthesis in Lyngbya majuscula (Flatt et al., 2006; Galonic et al., 2006). The MCD-assay-guided protein purification from F. ambigua however, proved to be difficult and led to false positive results, making a critical review of this widely used assay for HPO activity necessary. 2. Results The terrestrial cyanobacterium F. ambigua is a filamen-tous growing organism of the family Stigonemataceae and originates from a sample obtained from a shallow depres-sion at Mellingen, Switzerland. The polyhalogenated aro-matic metabolites ambigol A, B, C and tjipanazole D (Fig. 1) have been isolated from this strain using different culture media (Falch et al., 1993; Wright et al., 2005).

Wagner et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 323\u2013332 327 while antiplasmodial and trypanocidal effects were addi-tionally observed for ambigol C. The MCD-assay was regarded as a suitable method to guide protein purification from F. ambigua in order to detect enzymes with HPO activity, probably involved in ambigol and tjipanazole D formation. As a positive control CPO of the fungus C. fumago was used and yielded declin-ing UV absorptions at 290 nm dependant on the CPO amounts (units/ml) used. Purification of cell contents such as DNA or proteins from the investigated cyanobacterium proved to be most difficult due to an interfering thick polysaccharide sheath surrounding the cell filaments. Therefore, intensive homog-enization of the biomass, which originated from large-scale cultivation, was needed to achieve sufficient cell breakage by sonication. After removal of all cell debris by centrifu-gation and an ammonium sulfate precipitation a crude pro-tein extract was obtained. No halogenating activity could be observed in the crude extract which is frequently reported to be due to interfering catalases (van Pee and Lingens, 1985). Subsequent protein purification was hence achieved by fast protein liquid chro-matography (FPLC) and directly after the first FPLC puri-fication step on Butyl Sepharose 4FF a decreasing UV absorbance was monitored within the MCD-assay. This activity within the protein fractions became more conspic-uous with each step of purification. The effectiveness of sonication treatment and of all purification steps was Fig. 4.

The purified protein gave a single band between 6 and 8 kDa on a silver nitrate stained gel (Fig. 4) while the fraction eluted from the Superdex 200 column indicated a molecular weight of approximately 17 kDa for the native protein. The results of the purification procedure are summarized in Table 1. During the purification procedure the functional assay was initially performed using potassium bromide, since bromination reactions are known to occur less specific than chlorinations (van Pee, 1990). Subsequently the purified protein was assayed for chlorination activity using potas-sium chloride and found to be active even though to a lower extent. The UV/Vis absorption spectrum of the purified protein displayed a Soret band at 417 nm along with two small bands at 522 nm and 552 nm as is typical for proteins with a heme prosthetic group (Fig. 5) (Ma\u0308ntele, 1998; Reuter and Wiegand, 2001). The involvement of a heme moiety was confirmed by the observation that the MCD-assay reaction could be inhibited by addition of sodium azide. MALDI-TOF analysis yielded a molecular mass of 9.7 kDa for the monomer (Fig. 6, Supplementary data) which corresponded with the data determined by denatur-izing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

How-ever, comparison of the molecular weights showed that the size of the purified protein was considerably smaller than that of other HPOs. The heme-CPO from C. fumago has been characterized to be 42 kDa in size (Morris and Hager, 1966), whereas Va-HPOs have been described to be com-posed of subunits of about 65 kDa (Coupe et al., 2007; Hemrika et al., 1999; Weyand et al., 1999). Only for the CPO of Notomastus lobatus it has been reported that the heme-containing subunits have a relative molecular mass of around 16 kDa. However, this HPO is unique in also requiring a flavoprotein component for peroxidase activity (Littlechild, 1999; Roach et al., 1997). N-terminal-sequencing of the first 26 amino acids revealed the amino acid composition to be NH2-Ala-Asp-Leu-Ala-Leu-X-Lys-Gln-Val-Phe-Asp-Gly-Asn-X-Ala-Ala-X-His-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Asn-Ser-Val-Ile. In a multi-sequence alignment (Fig. 7) this fragment clearly demon-strated homology to several cytochrome c6 proteins of other cyanobacteria (Aitken, 1977; Cohn et al., 1989; Ulrich et al., 1982) as well as green algae (Campos et al., 1993; Okamoto et al., 1987; Schnackenberg et al., 1999), including the typical heme binding motif as well as the Gly22 residue which is known to be absolutely conserved within the sequence of all cytochrome c6 proteins (Reuter and Wiegand, 2001). To answer the question whether the reaction of the puri-fied F. ambigua protein in conjunction with MCD was truly a halogenation process HPLC-MS measurements of MCD reaction products were performed. Therefore, large scale MCD-assay reaction mixtures were analyzed, focusing on the characterization of the substrate conversion and prod-uct formation. With these techniques no di-halogenated dimedone could be observed. HPLC-MS data rather evi-denced the formation of a reaction product with a UV maximum at 208 nm (MCD UV maximum at 290 nm) and a prominent signal for m/z at 159 in a negative mode ESI\u2013MS experiment (Fig. 8, Supplementary data). ESI\u2013 MS measurements did not show isotope signals character-istic for halogenated compounds. Comparative studies with other cytochrome c proteins, i.e. from Halorhodospira halo-phila and from equine heart, showed a similar conversion of MCD during the assay, again without forming haloge-nated products. A potential involvement of the purified protein within the biosynthesis of the chlorinated compounds found in F. ambigua was investigated using 3-phenoxyphenol and 2,2 0-dihydroxybiphenyl (Fig. 9) as substrates instead of MCD, since these substrates are more structurally related to the potential precursors of the natural products ambigol A, B, C. HPLC-MS analysis however, showed that no hal-ogenated products were formed. From a final comparison of absorption spectra of the MCD reaction mixture in the presence and absence of halide ions it became evident that the purified F. ambigua protein was not involved in halogenation processes. A decrease in the MCD absorbance was thereby visible in both spectra, as reported for lignin peroxidases of the fun-gus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Farhangrazi et al., 1992). Thus, in the current study the MCD-assay led to the purification of a protein not involved in halogenation, but catalyzing an unspecific reaction of MCD. 3. Discussion Biohalogenation processes are most important due to the wide occurrence of halogenated natural products hav-ing varied biological activities. Precise understanding of biological halogenation will give rise to mild methods for modifying compounds of potential therapeutic use. In an attempt to investigate the biohalogenation of the polychlorinated metabolites known from F. ambigua the routinely used MCD-assay was utilized to monitor for HPO activity. Under standard reaction conditions an active protein could be purified, using the spectrophoto-metrical detection method as outlined in literature (Hager C. Wagner et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 323\u2013332 329 et al., 1966; Sundaramoorthy, 2001; Wever and Hemrika, 2001). Detailed analysis, however, made clear that the pro-tein purified during this study was not linked to halogena-tion processes, neither in conjunction with MCD nor with potential ambigol-precursors. The MCD-assay has to be judged as extremely useful when monitoring potential HPO activity, however false positive results have to be expected. To recognize a decline in UV absorption not due to halogenation direct comparison with a control experiment conducted without halogen addition (potas-sium bromide, potassium chloride) is recommended. Likewise, other literature reports indicated further trou-ble spots of this widely utilized method. Van Pee and co-workers (van Pee et al., 2000) identified enzymes from pyr-rolnitrin-producing Pseudomonas strains, which showed activity within the MCD-assay but lacked a heme-chromo-phore or any metal prosthetic group. In these cases activity could only be detected in acetate buffer but no reactivity was determinable in phosphate buffer (Burd et al., 1995). Biochemical investigations showed that enzymatically formed peracid was responsible for the bromination of MCD. Thus, it was concluded that this was not a true per-oxidase activity but rather a perhydrolysis of an ester formed between the active site of the enzyme and the acetic acid contained in the buffer. The hereby formed peracid then oxidized non-enzymatically halide ions into hypoha-lous acid which acted as a free diffusible halogenating agent. Purification of a protein with perhydrolysis activity by means of the MCD-assay can thus be avoided by utiliz-ing buffer systems not capable of peracid formation. There-fore, in our study all reactions were performed in potassium phosphate buffer. Powers and co-workers (Farhangrazi et al., 1992) dem-onstrated, while investigating the HPO activities of Phan-erochaete chrysosporium lignin peroxidases (H2, H8), that MCD itself can be substrate for general peroxidase reac-tions. They observed that direct oxidation of MCD resulted in a decrease of UV absorption at 288 nm. How-ever this gave a shifted absorption maximum at shorter wavelengths (270 nm), whereas the absorption band disap-pears completely over time when MCD was truly haloge-nated. In accordance with this, it was shown that HPO activity diminished due to direct reactions between MCD and the enzyme when myeloperoxidase-activity was investi-gated (Kettle and Winterbourn, 1994). In all organisms, cytochrome c proteins are involved in many physiological processes such as electron transport chains. In cyanobacteria and algae cytochrome c6 acts as an interthylakoidal one electron carrier between cyto-chrome b6f and photosystem I (Reuter and Wiegand, 2001). Thus, the involvement of cytochrome c6 proteins in diverse redox-systems can explain the observed direct reac-tivity of the purified protein with MCD in the HPO-assay. From other data of Itoh et al. (1988) it was implied that in HPO reactions the educt was only initially converted into monobromomonochlorodimedone, followed by spon-taneous elimination of halogen atoms and decomposition, to give unknown products. However, closer analytical investigations of the educt conversion and product forma-tion performed within this study did not reveal similar deg-radation processes. 4. Conclusions From our findings it has to be concluded that the spec-trophotometrical MCD-assay routinely used to detect HPO activity may yield false positive results, mainly since the assay focuses on the decline of the educt and not on the formation of the product. Our data indicate that the reaction of MCD with proteins of the cytochrome c \u2013 family leads to unspecific products. Non-specific conversions also need to be considered when performing similar assays e.g. the recently described method utilizing the colored sub-strate thionin (Manoj and Hager, 2006). Buffer components convertible to peracids by perhydrolysis reaction (Burd et al., 1995) as well as proteins with redox activity, as described herein, can yield false positive effects. In any case, results of the MCD-assay have to be judged critically and should be confirmed by analytical product characterization. Our results suggest that the enzymes responsible for the halogenation of ambigols and tjipanazole D are not CPOs. 5. Experimental 5.1. General experimental procedures UV/Vis spectral characterizations were performed with a Lambda 40 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin\u2013Elmer Instruments). HPLC separation of the large scale MCD-assay mixture was performed using a Macherey\u2013Nagel Nucleodur 100-5 C18 column (5 lm, 250 \u00b7 4.6 mm) on a Merck-Hitachi system equipped with an L-4500A photodi-ode array (PDA) detector. Elution was conducted with a gradient from 10/90 to 35/65 methanol/water containing ammonium acetate (2 mM), over 15 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 300 DPX spectrometer operating at 300 MHz. Samples were dissolved in deuterated methanol. For HPLC-(ESI)-MS experiments samples to be analyzed were diluted in methanol to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. A Macherey\u2013Nagel Nucleodur 100-5 C18 column (5 lm, 125 \u00b7 2 mm) was used on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system and chromatograms were monitored at 250 nm with a PDA detector. As mobile phase a methanol/water system buffered with 2 mM ammonium acetate was utilized and a gradient was applied from 10/90 to 100/0 in 20 min at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, ending isocratic for another 10 min. Ionization of characteristic peaks was achieved by an electro spray ionization (ESI) source and MS mea-surements were performed on an Applied Biosystems MDS Sciex API 2000 MS spectrometer. In MALDI-TOF-MS experiment 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic 330 C. Wagner et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 323\u2013332 acid was used as matrix and the spectrum was recorded on an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 4337. Polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis was performed with 12.5% or 20% polyacrylamide gels, respectively, containing sodium dodecyl sulfate on a Mini-Protean system (Bio-Rad Labo-ratories, Inc.). Gels were stained either with Coomassie dye or silver nitrate. Multisequence alignments were obtained with the ClustalW sequence analysis program of the Euro-pean Bioinformatics Institute. 5.2. Materials BG11-medium concentrate, MCD and cytochrome c from equine heart were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich Inc., semi purified cytochrome c551 from H. halophila was made avail-able by the Institute for Microbiology and Biotechnology, University of Bonn. Butyl Sepharose 4FF resin, DEAE Sepharose FF resin, Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column and Superdex 200 gel filtration column, as well as PD-10 desalting columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters were acquired from Milli-pore Corporation. All other chemicals used were obtained in analytical grade from commercial sources. 5.3. Culture F. ambigua (Na\u0308g.) Gomont, designated strain number 108b, was obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae of the Swiss Federal Institute for Water Resources and Pol-lution Control (EAWAG), Du\u0308bendorf, Switzerland. The strain was continuously cultivated in BG11-medium, in a 25 l photobioreactor (Planctotec, Type: Pluto) at 25 NoneC, under constant illumination with white fluorescent lamps (Osram L 58W/25) and was steamed by a sterile-filtered air flow. Biomass was harvested monthly by flow-through centrifugation (Heraeus Contifuge Stratos, Kendro Labo-ratory Products GmbH) and stored at None20 NoneC. 5.4. Protein purification Approximately 210 g wet weight biomass was suspended in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7) and progres-sively homogenized. Cell disruption was achieved by soni-cation (Brandson Sonifier 250) and the crude protein extract was kept on ice. After separation of the cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters to a volume of about 60 ml. For ammonium sulfate precipitation the solution was progressively brought to 40% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate while stirred on ice. After centrifugation the supernatant was passed onto a Butyl Sepharose 4FF hydrophobic interaction column which had been equilibrated with potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7, saturated to 40% ammonium sulfate) and a gradient of 40\u20130% ammonium sulfate was applied over 600 ml. Fractions assayed positive for protein content (A280) were tested for bromination activity. Cell disruption and pre-purification as described above were repeated three more times, starting with the same amount of biomass. Those fractions having activity in the MCD-assay were pooled from all four Butyl Sepharose 4FF separations and dialyzed against Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2) overnight. After concentration the protein solution was passed onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF anion exchange column equilibrated with Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2). A gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl was applied over 300 ml. Fractions active in the MCD-assay were pooled and desalted with PD-10 columns before their application onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column, which was equilibrated with Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2). A gradient was run from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl over 75 ml. Protein fractions (A280) were assayed as above and those active were applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Equilibration and elution was performed with Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). The purified protein was stored at None20 NoneC. 5.5. Monochlorodimedone assay Bromination and chlorination activity was measured by the method described previously (Hager et al., 1966) with MCD (42 lM) as substrate in presence of hydrogen perox-ide (8.8 mM) and potassium bromide (100 mM) or chloride (100 mM), respectively, in a total volume of 1 ml potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5.5) at room temperature. The reaction was started by adding the protein fractions and the decrease of MCD absorbance was recorded at 290 nm (e = 1.99 \u00b7 104 MNone1 cmNone1). Specific activity was expressed as unit per milligram protein, in which a unit was defined as lmol MCD decrease per minute. To analytically characterize the substrate conversion and product formation, the reaction was carried out in a 150 ml scale overnight. After incubation the reaction mix-ture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate and the combined extracts were evaporated to dryness.

Haloperoxidase (HPO) activity within F. ambigua was therefore assayed spectro-photometrically by using monochlorodimedone (MCD) during protein purification. This strategy revealed the isolation of a protein posi-tive in the MCD-assay, but an involvement in halogenating processes could not be verified. N-terminal sequencing rather demonstrated homology to cytochrome c6 from other cyanobacteria and green algae. From our findings it thus has to be concluded that the spectro-photometrical MCD-assay routinely used to detect HPO activity may yield false positive results, mainly since the assay focuses on the decline of the educt and not on the formation of the product. Our data indicate that the reaction of MCD with proteins of the cyto-chrome c\u2013 family leads to unspecific products. None 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "which might have altered bioactivities (Hofrichter and Ull-rich, 2006; Kling et al., 2005; Murphy, 2006; van Pee, 1996). In nature halogenated metabolites are widely spread and show varied biological activities. Around 4000 organohal-ogen compounds are known to be produced by living organisms (Anderson and Chapman, 2006; Gribble, 2003). Most of these biogenic organohalogens are mar-ine-derived and proposed to serve as antifeedant or anti-bacterial defense mechanisms. Besides simple haloalkanes like chloroform, bromoform, CH2Br2 or CHBr2CI, partic-ularly released by Phaeophytae, complex halogenated metabolites are known, such as terpenes and acetogenins from e.g., Laurencia species (Gross and Ko\u0308nig, 2006). Metabolites found in marine sponges, including haloge-nated fatty acids, indoles and phenolic derivatives, are often ascribable to associated microorganisms, including cyanobacteria (Ko\u0308nig et al., 2006) (Fig. 2). In particular chlorinated natural products (Fig. 1) such as the anticancer compound cryptophycin A from Nostoc sp. strain GSV 224 (Trimurtulu et al., 1994), different chlorinated indole",

The intention of the current study was to use the MCD-assay in order to detect enzymes responsible for the bio-halogenation of ambigol A, B, C and tjipanazole D precur-sors.

ESI\u2013 MS measurements did not show isotope signals character-istic for halogenated compounds.

HPLC-MS analysis however, showed that no hal-ogenated products were formed. From a final comparison of absorption spectra of the MCD reaction mixture in the presence and absence of halide ions it became evident that the purified F. ambigua protein was not involved in halogenation processes. A decrease in the MCD absorbance was thereby visible in both spectra, as reported for lignin peroxidases of the fun-gus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Farhangrazi et al., 1992). Thus, in the current study the MCD-assay led to the purification of a protein not involved in halogenation, but catalyzing an unspecific reaction of MCD.",
        "3. Discussion",
        "Biohalogenation processes are most important due to the wide occurrence of halogenated natural products hav-ing varied biological activities. Precise understanding of biological halogenation will give rise to mild methods for modifying compounds of potential therapeutic use. In an attempt to investigate the biohalogenation of the polychlorinated metabolites known from F. ambigua the routinely used MCD-assay was utilized to monitor for HPO activity. Under standard reaction conditions an active protein could be purified, using the spectrophoto-metrical detection method as outlined in literature (Hager",
        "C. Wagner et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 323\u2013332 329",
        "et al., 1966; Sundaramoorthy, 2001; Wever and Hemrika, 2001). Detailed analysis, however, made clear that the pro-tein purified during this study was not linked to halogena-tion processes, neither in conjunction with MCD nor with potential ambigol-precursors. The MCD-assay has to be judged as extremely useful when monitoring potential HPO activity, however false positive results have to be expected. To recognize a decline in UV absorption not due to halogenation direct comparison with a control experiment conducted without halogen addition (potas-sium bromide, potassium chloride) is recommended.",
        "Likewise, other literature reports indicated further trou-",
        "ble spots of this widely utilized method. Van Pee and co-workers (van Pee et al., 2000) identified enzymes from pyr-rolnitrin-producing Pseudomonas strains, which showed activity within the MCD-assay but lacked a heme-chromo-phore or any metal prosthetic group. In these cases activity could only be detected in acetate buffer but no reactivity was determinable in phosphate buffer (Burd et al., 1995). Biochemical investigations showed that enzymatically formed peracid was responsible for the bromination of MCD. Thus, it was concluded that this was not a true per-oxidase activity but rather a perhydrolysis of an ester formed between the active site of the enzyme and the acetic acid contained in the buffer. The hereby formed peracid then oxidized non-enzymatically halide ions into hypoha-lous acid which acted as a free diffusible halogenating agent. Purification of a protein with perhydrolysis activity by means of the MCD-assay can thus be avoided by utiliz-ing buffer systems not capable of peracid formation. There-fore, in our study all reactions were performed in potassium phosphate buffer.",
        "Powers and co-workers (Farhangrazi et al., 1992) dem-",
        "onstrated, while investigating the HPO activities of Phan-erochaete chrysosporium lignin peroxidases (H2, H8), that MCD itself can be substrate for general peroxidase reac-tions. They observed that direct oxidation of MCD resulted in a decrease of UV absorption at 288 nm. How-ever this gave a shifted absorption maximum at shorter wavelengths (270 nm), whereas the absorption band disap-pears completely over time when MCD was truly haloge-nated. In accordance with this, it was shown that HPO activity diminished due to direct reactions between MCD and the enzyme when myeloperoxidase-activity was investi-gated (Kettle and Winterbourn, 1994).",
        "In all organisms, cytochrome c proteins are involved in",
        "many physiological processes such as electron transport chains. In cyanobacteria and algae cytochrome c6 acts as an interthylakoidal one electron carrier between cyto-chrome b6f and photosystem I (Reuter and Wiegand, 2001). Thus, the involvement of cytochrome c6 proteins in diverse redox-systems can explain the observed direct reac-tivity of the purified protein with MCD in the HPO-assay.",
        "From other data of Itoh et al. (1988) it was implied that",
        "in HPO reactions the educt was only initially converted into monobromomonochlorodimedone, followed by spon-taneous elimination of halogen atoms and decomposition,",
        "to give unknown products. However, closer analytical investigations of the educt conversion and product forma-tion performed within this study did not reveal similar deg-radation processes.",
        "4. Conclusions",
        "From our findings it has to be concluded that the spec-trophotometrical MCD-assay routinely used to detect HPO activity may yield false positive results, mainly since the assay focuses on the decline of the educt and not on the formation of the product. Our data indicate that the reaction of MCD with proteins of the cytochrome c \u2013 family leads to unspecific products. Non-specific conversions also need to be considered when performing similar assays e.g. the recently described method utilizing the colored sub-strate thionin (Manoj and Hager, 2006). Buffer components convertible to peracids by perhydrolysis reaction (Burd et al., 1995) as well as proteins with redox activity, as described herein, can yield false positive effects. In any case, results of the MCD-assay have to be judged critically and should be confirmed by analytical product characterization. Our results suggest that the enzymes responsible for the halogenation of ambigols and tjipanazole D are not CPOs.",

        "BG11-medium concentrate, MCD and cytochrome c from equine heart were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich Inc., semi purified cytochrome c551 from H. halophila was made avail-able by the Institute for Microbiology and Biotechnology, University of Bonn. Butyl Sepharose 4FF resin, DEAE Sepharose FF resin, Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column and Superdex 200 gel filtration column, as well as PD-10 desalting columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters were acquired from Milli-pore Corporation. All other chemicals used were obtained in analytical grade from commercial sources.",
        "5.3. Culture",
        "F. ambigua (Na\u0308g.) Gomont, designated strain number 108b, was obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae of the Swiss Federal Institute for Water Resources and Pol-lution Control (EAWAG), Du\u0308bendorf, Switzerland. The strain was continuously cultivated in BG11-medium, in a 25 l photobioreactor (Planctotec, Type: Pluto) at 25 NoneC, under constant illumination with white fluorescent lamps (Osram L 58W/25) and was steamed by a sterile-filtered air flow.

        "5.4. Protein purification",
        "Approximately 210 g wet weight biomass was suspended in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7) and progres-sively homogenized. Cell disruption was achieved by soni-cation (Brandson Sonifier 250) and the crude protein extract was kept on ice. After separation of the cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters to a volume of about 60 ml. For ammonium sulfate precipitation the solution was progressively brought to 40% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate while stirred on ice.",
        "After centrifugation the supernatant was passed onto a Butyl Sepharose 4FF hydrophobic interaction column which had been equilibrated with potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7, saturated to 40% ammonium sulfate) and a gradient of 40\u20130% ammonium sulfate was applied over 600 ml. Fractions assayed positive for protein content (A280) were tested for bromination activity.",
        "Cell disruption and pre-purification as described above were repeated three more times, starting with the same amount of biomass. Those fractions having activity in the MCD-assay were pooled from all four Butyl Sepharose 4FF separations and dialyzed against Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2) overnight. After concentration the protein solution was passed onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF anion exchange column equilibrated with Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2). A gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl was applied over 300 ml. Fractions active in the MCD-assay were pooled and desalted with PD-10 columns before their application onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column, which was equilibrated with Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2). A gradient was run from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl over 75 ml. Protein fractions (A280) were assayed as above and those active were applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Equilibration and elution was performed with Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). The purified protein was stored at None20 NoneC.",

        "Bromination and chlorination activity was measured by the method described previously (Hager et al., 1966) with MCD (42 lM) as substrate in presence of hydrogen perox-ide (8.8 mM) and potassium bromide (100 mM) or chloride (100 mM), respectively, in a total volume of 1 ml potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5.5) at room temperature. The reaction was started by adding the protein fractions and the decrease of MCD absorbance was recorded at 290 nm (e = 1.99 \u00b7 104 MNone1 cmNone1). Specific activity was expressed as unit per milligram protein, in which a unit was defined as lmol MCD decrease per minute. To analytically characterize the substrate conversion and product formation, the reaction was carried out in a 150 ml scale overnight. After incubation the reaction mix-ture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate and the combined extracts were evaporated to dryness.",
