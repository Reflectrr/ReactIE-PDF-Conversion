The biochemical mechanisms of the halogenation of natural products by different enzyme classes have only recently been elucidated.[2,3] Especially the FADH2-dependent halogenases, which were first discovered by genetic experiments of Dairi et al.[4] and investigated biochemi-cally by van P4e and co-workers,[5,6] are of pivotal importance for the generation of many bioactive natural products, pre-dominantly in microorganisms. Genes for FADH2-dependent halogenases are contained in many biosynthetic gene clusters, for example, those of chlortetracycline, vancomycin and chlor-amphenicol.[5] It is tempting to speculate that halogenases could be a powerful tool for combinatorial biosynthesis, that is, for the generation of new compounds by recombination of biosynthetic genes from different organisms. Many examples have been published for successful combinatorial biosynthesis by using the genes for modules of polyketide synthases of nonribosomal peptide synthases, for oxygenases, methyltrans-ferases, deoxysugar biosynthesis enzymes and glycosyltransfer-ases. In contrast, only four examples are found in the literature for the use of halogenases in such experiments.[7\u201310] Here, we describe a further example for the successful use of a halogen-ase in combinatorial biosynthesis ; this is likely to be the first such experiment that uses a halogenase that acts on a acyl carrier protein bound substrate. The aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin and coumermy-cin A1 (Scheme 1) are powerful inhibitors of bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase IV and have strong antibacterial activity.[11] The binding mode of these compounds to gyrase has been in-vestigated by X-ray crystallography.[12] The 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety, which is attached by an ester bond to the deoxysugar, is of central importance for the interaction of these antibiotics with their targets. This moiety occupies a hy-drophobic pocket of gyrase and is crucial for the exceptionally high affinity of clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 to gyrase. [11] The pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety of clorobiocin and cou-mermycin A1 is biosynthetically derived from proline, and the 5-methyl group is subsequently attached under catalysis of the C-methyltransferases CloN6 or CouN6, respectively.[13] Hormaomycin is a depsipeptide antibiotic formed by Strep-tomyces griseoflavus W-384.[14\u201316] It also contains a pyrrole-2-car-boxylic acid moiety, which is in this case attached by an amide bond to the peptide backbone of the molecule. However, in contrast to clorobiocin and coumermycin A1, the pyrrole [a] Prof. Dr. L. Heide, L. Westrich, Dr. C. Anderle, Dr. B.

The depsipeptide antibiotic hormaomycin, which is produced by Streptomyces griseoflavus W-384, contains a 5-chloropyrrole moiety. In the producer strain we identified the gene hrmQ that shows sequence similarity to FADH2-dependent halogenases. This gene was cloned and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS12.976, which is the produc-er of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin, which contains a 5-methylpyrrole moiety. For the present experiment, we used a mutant of this strain in which the respective pyrrole-5-methyl-transferase had been inactivated. Expression of the halogenase hrmQ in this mutant strain led to the formation of two new clor-obiocin derivatives that carried a 5-chloropyrrole moiety. These compounds were isolated on a preparative scale, their structures were elucidated by 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and their antibacterial activity was determined. The substrate of HrmQ is likely to be a pyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[acyl carrier protein] thioester. If this assumption is true, this study presents the first experiment in combinatorial biosynthesis that uses a halogenase that acts on an acyl carrier protein-bound substrate. 1992 E 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co. KGaA, Weinheim ChemBioChem 2008, 9, 1992 \u2013 1999 moiety of hormaomycin carries a chlorine rather than a methyl group at C5, and in addition it is N-hydroxylated. The biosyn-thetic origin of the N-hydroxyl group is unknown. Recently, the gene cluster for hormaomycin biosynthesis has been identified (J. Piel et al. , unpublished results). It was found to contain a gene, termed hrmQ, with sequence similarity to FADH2-depen-dent halogenases. We speculated that it might be responsible for the chlorination of C5 of the pyrrole moiety of hormaomy-cin. We examined whether the expression of hrmQ in a producer strain of aminocoumarin antibiotics can lead to formation of a hybrid compound that contains the skeleton of the aminocou-marin antibiotic, but carries a chlorine rather than a methyl group at position 5 of the pyrrole moiety. FADH2-dependent halogenation reactions require two en-zymes: the halogenase itself and a flavin reductase for the re-generation of the oxidised flavin cofactor. Only the putative halogenase hrmQ had been found in the hormaomycin gene cluster, not the reductase. It has been shown that flavin-depen-dent halogenases can functionally interact with flavin reductas-es from other pathways.[5] However, to minimise any problems that result from the possible lack of a suitable reductase, we carried out the experiment using the clorobiocin producer strain rather than the coumermycin producer strain. Clorobio-cin already contains a chlorine atom in position 8 of the ami-nocoumarin moiety, which is attached under catalysis of the FADH2-dependent halogenase Clo-hal. [17] Therefore, a suitable reductase for the regeneration of the flavin cofactor was ex-pected to be present in this organism. Results Sequence analysis of the putative halogenase gene hrmQ The gene hrmQ codes for a protein of 448 amino acids. A BLAST search revealed sequence similarity to FADH2-dependent halogenases, and the predicted amino acid sequence of HrmQ showed the two motifs that are conserved in flavin-dependent halogenases.[5] These are the GxGxxG motif at the N-terminal end, which is involved in the binding of the flavin cosubstrate, and the WxWxIP motif, which is located near the middle of the protein and is suggested to prevent the enzyme from catalyz-ing a monoxygenase rather than a halogenase reaction.[6] Three proteins in the database showed especially high se-quence similarity to HrmQ (Table 1 and Figure S1 in the Sup-porting Information): PltA, which catalyses the two chlorination reactions at positions 5 and 4 of the pyrrole moiety of pyolu-teorin;[18] Pyr29, which is suggested to catalyze the same reac-tion in the biosynthesis of pyrrolomycin;[19] and, less expected-ly, ChlB4, which is suggested to catalyse 5-chlorination of the 6-methyl salicylic acid moiety of chlorothricin.[20] In contrast, HalB of pentachloropseudilin biosynthesis[21] and PrnC of pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis,[22] both of which have been Scheme 1. Structures of coumermycin A1, clorobiocin and hormaomycin. biochemically proven to chlorinate pyrrole moieties, showed only low sequence similarity to HrmQ (Table 1). Cloning of hrmQ and expression in a genetically modified producer strain of clorobiocin The gene hrmQ was amplified by PCR from a cosmid that ACHTUNGTRENNUNGcontained part of the hormaomycin cluster of S. griseoflavus W-384, and was cloned into the expression vector pUWL201 (thioR) ;[23] this placed it under control of the constitutive ermE* promoter. The resulting plasmid was termed pLW42. Clorobiocin is produced by Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS12.976. This strain contains the methyltransfer-ase gene cloN6 that is responsible for the methylation of posi-tion 5 of the pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety.[13] To avoid that the desired 5-chlorination by HrmQ had to compete with 5-methylation by the genuine CloN6, we used a mutant strain in which the cloN6 gene had been inactivated. This strain accu-mulates a clorobiocin derivative, novclobiocin 109, which is not substituted at position 5 of the pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety.[13] The hrmQ expression plasmid pLW42 was introduced into this mutant by protoplast transformation. After selection of transformants by thiostrepton resistance, cultures were estab-lished from single spores of the transformants. The presence of the intact plasmid was confirmed by DNA isolation and restric-tion analysis. Analysis of secondary metabolites Reversed-phase HPLC of extracts from the strain transformed with pLW42 in comparison to the parent strain showed two new peaks (compounds 1 and 2), which had higher retention times than novclobiocin 109 (Figure 1). LC\u2013MS analysis with ionisation in the positive mode showed a pseudomolecular ion [M+H]+ at m/z 717 for both compounds, in comparison to m/z 697 for clorobiocin. This corresponds to the loss of a methyl group and the gain of a chlorine atom. Both new com-pounds showed the characteristic isotopic signature of a di-chlorinated compound that results from the high abundance of the heavy isotope 37Cl (24.2%) besides the dominant 35Cl. The predicted isotopic pattern, which was calculated by using the Xcalibur 1.3 software suite (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), was identical with the measured one. Tandem-MS analysis of the pseudomolecular ion showed the fragments of the preny-lated 4-hydroxybenzoyl moiety (m/z 189) for both compounds (Figure 2) and of the aglycon clorobiocic acid (m/z 416), which is identical to the mass spectrum of clorobiocin. However, in comparison to clorobiocin, the mass of the substituted deoxy-Table 1. Sequence comparison of HrmQ with other FADH2-dependent halogenases. Figure 2. Tandem MS analysis of novclobiocin 124 and 125 in comparison to clorobiocin. Left-hand panels show the fragmentation pattern of the pseudomo-sugar moiety showed an increase of 20 Da (i.e. , m/z 302 rather than 282). Likewise, the fragment that corresponded to the substituted pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety showed a mass ACHTUNGTRENNUNGincrease from m/z 108 to 128. Therefore, it was the pyrrole moiety that had lost a methyl group and gained a chlorine atom. Both for clorobiocin and for the two new compounds, pseudo-MS3 analysis (in-source CID fragmentation followed by MS/MS measurements) showed the characteristic fragmenta-tion pattern of the differently substituted pyrrole-2-carboxyl moieties (Figure 2).[24] Therefore, LC\u2013MS analysis showed that the expression of hrmQ had indeed resulted in the formation of two new cloro-biocin derivatives, chlorinated rather than methylated in the pyrrole moiety. However, mass spectroscopic analysis was in-sufficient to prove which position of the pyrrole moiety was substituted with the chlorine, and likewise it was insufficient to show the structural difference between compounds 1 and 2. We therefore isolated both compounds on a preparative scale and subjected them to 1H NMR analysis (see the Experimental Section). Compound 1 showed the same 1H NMR signals as clorobio-cin for the prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoyl moiety, the aminocou-marin moiety and the deoxysugar moiety. However, the signal of the methyl group at 5\u2019\u2019\u2019 (Scheme 1), which is present in the spectrum of clorobiocin was missing in compound 1. As in clorobiocin, the pyrrole protons at positions 3\u2019\u2019\u2019 and 4\u2019\u2019\u2019 cou-pled with each other; this resulted in doublet signals for both protons (J=3.6 Hz). The absence of the proton signal of H5\u2019\u2019\u2019, which is observed in novclobiocin 109 at 7.02 ppm,[13] as well as the multiplicity of the signals of H4\u2019\u2019\u2019 and H3\u2019\u2019\u2019 proved that no proton was present at 5\u2019\u2019\u2019, that is, the chlorine had been ACHTUNGTRENNUNGintroduced at this position. Correspondingly, the signal of H4\u2019\u2019\u2019 in compound 1 (6.12 ppm) showed a slight downfield shift in comparison to H4\u2019\u2019\u2019 of clorobiocin (5.94 ppm). Therefore, the structure shown in Scheme 2 was ACHTUNGTRENNUNGassigned to compound 1, which was then designated as novclobiocin 124. Compound 2 showed the same signals for the prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoyl moiety, the aminocoumarin moiety and the 5-chloropyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety as compound 1, includ-ing the doublet signals of the pyrrole protons H3\u2019\u2019\u2019 and H4\u2019\u2019\u2019 at 6.95 and 6.12 ppm, respectively. However, the chemical shift of the signals of the deoxysugar protons at 2\u2019\u2019 and 3\u2019\u2019 had changed markedly. The signal of the axial proton H3\u2019\u2019 (Scheme 1), which showed strong coupling with the axial H4\u2019\u2019 (J=10.5 Hz) had shifted upfield from 5.72 ppm (compound 1 and clorobiocin) to 4.45 ppm. In contrast, the signal of the Scheme 2. Hypothetical scheme of the pyrrole-5-halogenation reactions in the biosynthesis of hormaomycin and in the formation of the new clorobiocin de-equatorial proton H2\u2019\u2019, which coupled more weakly with the axial H3\u2019\u2019 and the equatorial H1\u2019\u2019 had shifted downfield from 4.35 ppm (compound 1 and clorobiocin) to 5.40 ppm. This showed that in compound 2 the 5-chloropyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety was attached to the 2\u2019\u2019-OH group rather than to the 3\u2019\u2019-OH group (Schemes 1 and 2). Similar 2\u2019\u2019-acylated com-pounds have been found in earlier studies[13,25, 26] and showed very similar NMR spectroscopic signals of H2\u2019\u2019 and H3\u2019\u2019 as com-pound 2. Therefore, the structure shown in Scheme 2 was as-signed to compound 2, and this second new clorobiocin deriv-atives was designated as novclobiocin 125. Antibacterial activity of the new clorobiocin derivatives The antibacterial activities of novclobiocin 124 and 125 were determined in a disc-diffusion assay against Bacillus subtilis and compared to authentic clorobiocin (Figure 3). Novclobiocin 124 showed similar activity as clorobiocin; this suggests that the 5-chloropyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety is nearly equivalent to the genuine 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety in ensur-ing a tight binding of the inhibitor to gyrase. In contrast, nov-clobiocin 109, which does not carry a substituent at position 5 of the pyrrole ring, has been found to be eight-times less active than clorobiocin.[13] Novclobiocin 125, with the 5-chloro-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety attached to the 2-OH group of the deoxysugar, showed only 25% of the activity of clorobio-cin. Discussion In the present study, expression of the halogenase gene hrmQ in a clorobiocin producer strain, which is defective in the 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-methyltransferase gene cloN6, was shown to result in the for-mation of 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-chlorinated clorobiocin derivatives. This finding supports the functional assignment of hrmQ to the halogena-tion reaction at position 5 of the pyrrole moiety of hormaomy-cin. Many FADH2-dependent halogenases have been putatively identified from DNA sequence data, but functional proof from biochemical experiments is only available for eight of these ACHTUNGTRENNUNGenzymes, and proof from genetic experiments for a further three.[5,27,28] Our study now provides functional proof for a fur-ther halogenase. For hormaomycin biosynthesis, no experimental data are available to indicate at which stage of the biosynthetic reac-tion sequence the halogenation of the pyrrole moiety takes place. However, investigations on the biosynthesis of pyolu-teorin in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 have revealed the mechanism of the formation of the 4,5-dichloropyrrole-2-car-bonyl moiety of that molecule (Scheme 2).[18] Proline is first ACHTUNGTRENNUNGadenylated under catalysis of the prolyl-AMP-ligase PltF, then transferred to the 4\u2019-phosphopantheteinyl cofactor of the small acyl carrier protein PltL and finally oxidised by the flavoprotein PltE to the pyrrole derivative. Subsequently, the FADH2-depen-dent halogenase PltA catalyses two successive halogenations at position 5 and 4 of the pyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[acyl carrier pro-tein] intermediate. HrmQ shows high sequence similarity with PltA (Table 1). Notably, both the hormaomycin and the cloro-biocin biosynthetic gene cluster also contain genes with se-quence similarity to the prolyl-AMP-ligase PltF, the acyl carrier protein PltL and the flavoprotein PltE. It appears therefore likely that in hormaomycin biosynthesis, HrmQ acts on a ACHTUNGTRENNUNGpyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[HrmL] thioester (Scheme 2), although no biochemical evidence has yet been provided for the HrmQ re-action. Detailed evidence is available on the function of the corre-sponding genes of clorobiocin biosynthesis.[29\u201333] In contrast to pyoluteorin biosynthesis, the formation of clorobiocin involves the successive attachment of the pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety to two different acyl carrier proteins, that is, CloN5 and CloN1, before 5-methylation and transfer to the deoxysugar (Scheme 2). We expressed only the halogenase HrmQ, and not the acyl carrier protein HrmL in the mutated clorobiocin producer strain. Therefore, our transgenic strain HrmQ is expected to act on either pyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[CloN5] or pyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[CloN1] (Scheme 2). HrmL, CloN5 and CloN1 are of similar size (91, 89 and 95 amino acids, respectively), and all contain the characteristic Asp ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(Asn)-Ser-Leu site for attachment of the 4\u2019-phosphopantheteinyl cofactor. However, HrmL shares only 29% sequence identity (and 57% sequence similarity) with CloN5, and no significant sequence similarity with CloN1. This difference between HrmL and CloN5/CloN1 might be responsi-ble for the relatively low yield of 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-chlorinated compounds obtained in the present study. In the strain that expressed the halogenase hrmQ, only about 5% of the aminocoumarin anti-biotics were accumulated in the form of 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-chlorinated com-pounds, while the major part remained in 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-unsubstituted form. In contrast, when we inactivated the methyltransferase genes novO and couO, which are responsible for 8\u2019-methylation of the aminocoumarin moieties of novobiocin and clorobiocin, and expressed the corresponding 8\u2019-halogenase from the cloro-biocin cluster in the resulting mutants, more than 75% of the aminocoumarins were accumulated as 8\u2019-chlorinated com-pounds.[7,9] In these two cases, the substrates of the halogena-tion reactions are likely to be identical to those of the methyla-tion reactions,[34,35] although the Clo-hal reaction has not yet been demonstrated in vitro. Figure 3. Antibacterial activity of novclobiocin 124 and 125 in comparison to It has been speculated that the use of halogenases for com-binatorial biosynthesis in vivo could be very problematic be-cause many of the substrates are halogenated only when teth-ered to an acyl carrier protein (ACP), and the substrate specific-ity of the halogenases might prevent their action on substrates bound to a heterologous ACP.[5] Our study suggests that in vivo halogenation of an ACP-bound substrate by a heterolo-gous halogenase is possible, and similar evidence has been provided from an in vitro study with PltA.[18] The amino acid sequences of several halogenases that act on different ACP-bound substrates are extremely similar (Table 1 and Figure S1). This offers prospects for both combina-torial biosynthesis and for directed evolution of such enzymes. In contrast, the FADH2-dependent halogenases acting on free aromatic substrates show little sequence similarity to HrmQ, even if they also chlorinate pyrrole moieties (Table 1). These enzymes are unlikely to accept ACP-bound pyrroles. In our ex-periment, the mutant strain used for hrmQ expression con-tained an active halogenase, Clo-hal,[17] even before the intro-duction of the hrmQ expression plasmid pLW42. However, by using LC\u2013MS analysis novclobiocin 124 and 125 could not be detected in the strain that lacked pLW42; this proves that the substrate specificity of Clo-hal allowed, as expected, only the halogenation of the aminocoumarin moiety, and not of the pyrrole moiety. Hormaomycin biosynthesis involves not only the 5-chlorina-tion but also the N-hydroxylation of the pyrrole moiety (Scheme 1). However, LC\u2013MS analysis of the DcloN6 mutant ex-pressing hrmQ did not show any N-hydroxylated analogues of novclobiocin 124 and 125. This suggests that a further enzyme is required for the N-hydroxylation of the pyrrole moieties in hormaomycin biosynthesis. Halogenation is a powerful tool, both in synthetic medicinal chemistry and in secondary metabolism in nature, to modify the physical and chemical properties and thereby the bioactivi-ties of small molecules. With our growing knowledge of the mechanism of biological halogenations, and the rapidly grow-ing number of known genes for halogenases with different substrate specificities, halogenases may become a useful tool for combinatorial biosynthesis. Experimental Section Bacterial strains and culture conditions : E. coli XL1 Blue MRF\u2019 (Stratagene) was used for cloning experiments and grown in liquid or on solid Luria\u2013Bertani medium (1.5% agar) at 37 8C.[36] The mutant strain S. roseochromogenes var. oscitans (DcloN6) has been described previously.[13] Thiostrepton (12 mgmLNone1 for solid media and 40 mgmLNone1 for liquid media) and carbenicillin (50\u2013100 mgmLNone1) were used for selection of recombinant strains. DNA isolation, manipulation and cloning : Standard methods for DNA isolation and manipulation were performed as described by Sambrook and Russell[36] and by Kieser et al.[37] Isolation of plasmids was carried out with ion exchange columns (Nucleobond AX kits, Macherey\u2013Nagel, DOren, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Construction of plasmid pLW42 : The E. coli\u2013Streptomyces shuttle vector pUWL201, which contained the ermE* promoter,[23] was used for the construction of the expression plasmid pLW42. The gene hrmQ was amplified by PCR. A HindIII site was introduced before the start codon by using primer hrmQ_F (5\u2019-AAGCTTAT-GAGCGACTTCGACTACGAC-3\u2019). At the C terminus, an XbaI restric-tion site was introduced after the stop codon by using primer hrmQ_R (5\u2019-TCTAGATGGGCGAGCTCAGAAGAGCGG-3\u2019). Bold letters represent the introduced restriction sites. PCR amplification was performed in a 50 mL volume with template (600 ng), dNTPs (0.2 mm), each primer (10 pmol) and DMSO (5%, v/v) with the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals): denaturation at 94 8C for 2 min, 24 cycles with denaturation at 94 8C for 1 min, annealing at 68 8C for 45 s and elongation at 72 8C for 90 s, followed by the last elongation step at 72 8C for 5 min. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega); this resulted in pLW41. The plasmid pLW41 was digested with ACHTUNGTRENNUNG indIII and XbaI and subsequently hrmQ was cloned into the same sites of pUWL201 to give pLW42. Transformation : Transformation of S. roseochromogenes (DcloN6)[13] was carried out by PEG-mediated protoplast transformation.[37] For preparation of protoplasts, CRM medium[38] was used. Before trans-formation of the S. roseochromogenes mutant, the recombinant plasmids were amplified in E. coli ET12567 to bypass methyl-sens-ing restriction.[39] Production of new aminocoumarin antibiotics : The Streptomyces strains were cultured as described previously[25] for seven days at 33 8C and 210 rpm. For analytical purposes, bacterial culture (1 mL) was acidified with HCl to pH 4 and extracted twice with an equal volume of EtOAc. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was redissolved in MeOH (100 mL). After centrifugation, the supernatant (80 mL) was analyzed by HPLC with a Multosphere 120 RP18\u20135 column (5 mm, 250Q8 mm, C&S Chromatographie Service, DOren, Germany) at a flow rate of 2 mLminNone1. A linear gradient from 60% to 100% solvent B (solvent A=H2O/HCOOH 99:1; solvent B=ace-tonitrile/HCOOH 99:1) over 30 min was used. UV detection was car-ried out at 340 nm. Authentic clorobiocin (Aventis) was used as standard. For preparative isolation of the products, cells were cultured as ACHTUNGTRENNUNGdescribed above by using a total culture volume of 3.75 L. The an-tibiotics were isolated as described previously.[25] Novclobiocin 124 (1.5 mg) and novclobiocin 125 (0.5 mg) were obtained. Structure elucidation : Positive electrospray ionisation (ESI) mass spectra were obtained from a Finnigan TSQ Quantum instrument (electrospray voltage 3.8 kV; heated capillary temperature 320 8C; sheath and auxiliary gas: N2; sheath gas flow rate: 30.1 AU; aux gas flow rate: 12.0 AU) that was equipped with a Supersphere 100 RP 18 endcapped column (4 mm, 2Q150 mm, Merck). For HPLC separation a H2O/acetonitrile gradient (each contained 0.1% HCOOH) ranging from 0% acetonitrile to 50% acetonitrile over 20 min was used, followed by elution with 100% acetonitrile for 5 min and equilibration with 100% H2O (that contained 0.1% HCOOH) for 4 min; the flow rate was set to 0.2 mLminNone1. The colli-sion-induced dissociation (CID) spectra during the HPLC run were recorded with collision energy +20 eV, collision gas argon, and col-lision pressure of 1.0Q10None3 Torr (133 MPa). The 1H NMR spectra were measured by using an Avance 400 spec-trometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany, 400 MHz) with CD3OD as sol-vent. 1998 www.chembiochem.org E 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co.

        "Introduction",
        "Nature\u2019s inventory of secondary metabolites comprises thou-sands of halogenated compounds.[1] Incorporation of halogen atoms into the respective molecules alters the chemical and physical properties and often has a profound effect on the bio-logical activity of the compound. The biochemical mechanisms of the halogenation of natural products by different enzyme classes have only recently been elucidated.[2,3] Especially the FADH2-dependent halogenases, which were first discovered by genetic experiments of Dairi et al.[4] and investigated biochemi-cally by van P4e and co-workers,[5,6] are of pivotal importance for the generation of many bioactive natural products, pre-dominantly in microorganisms. Genes for FADH2-dependent halogenases are contained in many biosynthetic gene clusters, for example, those of chlortetracycline, vancomycin and chlor-amphenicol.[5] It is tempting to speculate that halogenases could be a powerful tool for combinatorial biosynthesis, that is, for the generation of new compounds by recombination of biosynthetic genes from different organisms. Many examples have been published for successful combinatorial biosynthesis by using the genes for modules of polyketide synthases of nonribosomal peptide synthases, for oxygenases, methyltrans-ferases, deoxysugar biosynthesis enzymes and glycosyltransfer-ases. In contrast, only four examples are found in the literature for the use of halogenases in such experiments.[7\u201310] Here, we describe a further example for the successful use of a halogen-ase in combinatorial biosynthesis ; this is likely to be the first such experiment that uses a halogenase that acts on a acyl carrier protein bound substrate.",
        "The aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin and coumermy-cin A1 (Scheme 1) are powerful inhibitors of bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase IV and have strong antibacterial activity.[11] The binding mode of these compounds to gyrase has been in-vestigated by X-ray crystallography.[12] The 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety, which is attached by an ester bond to the deoxysugar, is of central importance for the interaction of these antibiotics with their targets. This moiety occupies a hy-drophobic pocket of gyrase and is crucial for the exceptionally high affinity of clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 to gyrase. [11] The pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety of clorobiocin and cou-mermycin A1 is biosynthetically derived from proline, and the 5-methyl group is subsequently attached under catalysis of the C-methyltransferases CloN6 or CouN6, respectively.[13]",
        "Hormaomycin is a depsipeptide antibiotic formed by Strep-tomyces griseoflavus W-384.[14\u201316] It also contains a pyrrole-2-car-boxylic acid moiety, which is in this case attached by an amide bond to the peptide backbone of the molecule.

        "The depsipeptide antibiotic hormaomycin, which is produced by Streptomyces griseoflavus W-384, contains a 5-chloropyrrole moiety. In the producer strain we identified the gene hrmQ that shows sequence similarity to FADH2-dependent halogenases. This gene was cloned and heterologously expressed in Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS12.976, which is the produc-er of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin, which contains a 5-methylpyrrole moiety. For the present experiment, we used a mutant of this strain in which the respective pyrrole-5-methyl-transferase had been inactivated. Expression of the halogenase hrmQ in this mutant strain led to the formation of two new clor-obiocin derivatives that carried a 5-chloropyrrole moiety. These compounds were isolated on a preparative scale, their structures were elucidated by 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and their antibacterial activity was determined. The substrate of HrmQ is likely to be a pyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[acyl carrier protein] thioester. If this assumption is true, this study presents the first experiment in combinatorial biosynthesis that uses a halogenase that acts on an acyl carrier protein-bound substrate.",

        "moiety of hormaomycin carries a chlorine rather than a methyl group at C5, and in addition it is N-hydroxylated. The biosyn-thetic origin of the N-hydroxyl group is unknown. Recently, the gene cluster for hormaomycin biosynthesis has been identified (J. Piel et al. , unpublished results). It was found to contain a gene, termed hrmQ, with sequence similarity to FADH2-depen-dent halogenases. We speculated that it might be responsible for the chlorination of C5 of the pyrrole moiety of hormaomy-cin.",
        "We examined whether the expression of hrmQ in a producer strain of aminocoumarin antibiotics can lead to formation of a hybrid compound that contains the skeleton of the aminocou-marin antibiotic, but carries a chlorine rather than a methyl group at position 5 of the pyrrole moiety.",
        "FADH2-dependent halogenation reactions require two en-zymes: the halogenase itself and a flavin reductase for the re-generation of the oxidised flavin cofactor. Only the putative halogenase hrmQ had been found in the hormaomycin gene cluster, not the reductase. It has been shown that flavin-depen-dent halogenases can functionally interact with flavin reductas-es from other pathways.[5] However, to minimise any problems that result from the possible lack of a suitable reductase, we carried out the experiment using the clorobiocin producer strain rather than the coumermycin producer strain. Clorobio-cin already contains a chlorine atom in position 8 of the ami-nocoumarin moiety, which is attached under catalysis of the FADH2-dependent halogenase Clo-hal. [17] Therefore, a suitable reductase for the regeneration of the flavin cofactor was ex-pected to be present in this organism.",
        "Results Sequence analysis of the putative halogenase gene hrmQ The gene hrmQ codes for a protein of 448 amino acids. A BLAST search revealed sequence similarity to FADH2-dependent halogenases, and the predicted amino acid sequence of HrmQ showed the two motifs that are conserved in flavin-dependent halogenases.[5] These are the GxGxxG motif at the N-terminal end, which is involved in the binding of the flavin cosubstrate, and the WxWxIP motif, which is located near the middle of the protein and is suggested to prevent the enzyme from catalyz-ing a monoxygenase rather than a halogenase reaction.[6]",
        "Three proteins in the database showed especially high se-quence similarity to HrmQ (Table 1 and Figure S1 in the Sup-porting Information): PltA, which catalyses the two chlorination reactions at positions 5 and 4 of the pyrrole moiety of pyolu-teorin;[18] Pyr29, which is suggested to catalyze the same reac-tion in the biosynthesis of pyrrolomycin;[19] and, less expected-ly, ChlB4, which is suggested to catalyse 5-chlorination of the 6-methyl salicylic acid moiety of chlorothricin.[20]",

The resulting plasmid was termed pLW42.",
        "Clorobiocin is produced by Streptomyces roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS12.976. This strain contains the methyltransfer-ase gene cloN6 that is responsible for the methylation of posi-tion 5 of the pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety.[13] To avoid that the desired 5-chlorination by HrmQ had to compete with 5-methylation by the genuine CloN6, we used a mutant strain in which the cloN6 gene had been inactivated. This strain accu-mulates a clorobiocin derivative, novclobiocin 109, which is not substituted at position 5 of the pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety.[13]",
        "The hrmQ expression plasmid pLW42 was introduced into this mutant by protoplast transformation. After selection of transformants by thiostrepton resistance, cultures were estab-lished from single spores of the transformants. The presence of the intact plasmid was confirmed by DNA isolation and restric-tion analysis.",
        "Analysis of secondary metabolites Reversed-phase HPLC of extracts from the strain transformed with pLW42 in comparison to the parent strain showed two new peaks (compounds 1 and 2), which had higher retention times than novclobiocin 109 (Figure 1). LC\u2013MS analysis with ionisation in the positive mode showed a pseudomolecular ion [M+H]+ at m/z 717 for both compounds, in comparison to m/z 697 for clorobiocin. This corresponds to the loss of a methyl group and the gain of a chlorine atom. Both new com-pounds showed the characteristic isotopic signature of a di-chlorinated compound that results from the high abundance of the heavy isotope 37Cl (24.2%) besides the dominant 35Cl. The predicted isotopic pattern, which was calculated by using the Xcalibur 1.3 software suite (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), was identical with the measured one. Tandem-MS analysis of the pseudomolecular ion showed the fragments of the preny-lated 4-hydroxybenzoyl moiety (m/z 189) for both compounds (Figure 2) and of the aglycon clorobiocic acid (m/z 416), which is identical to the mass spectrum of clorobiocin. However, in comparison to clorobiocin, the mass of the substituted deoxy-",

        "sugar moiety showed an increase of 20 Da (i.e. , m/z 302 rather than 282). Likewise, the fragment that corresponded to the substituted pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety showed a mass ACHTUNGTRENNUNGincrease from m/z 108 to 128. Therefore, it was the pyrrole moiety that had lost a methyl group and gained a chlorine atom. Both for clorobiocin and for the two new compounds, pseudo-MS3 analysis (in-source CID fragmentation followed by MS/MS measurements) showed the characteristic fragmenta-tion pattern of the differently substituted pyrrole-2-carboxyl moieties (Figure 2).[24]",
        "Therefore, LC\u2013MS analysis showed that the expression of hrmQ had indeed resulted in the formation of two new cloro-biocin derivatives, chlorinated rather than methylated in the pyrrole moiety. However, mass spectroscopic analysis was in-sufficient to prove which position of the pyrrole moiety was substituted with the chlorine, and likewise it was insufficient to show the structural difference between compounds 1 and 2. We therefore isolated both compounds on a preparative scale and subjected them to 1H NMR analysis (see the Experimental Section).",
        "Compound 1 showed the same 1H NMR signals as clorobio-cin for the prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoyl moiety, the aminocou-marin moiety and the deoxysugar moiety. However, the signal of the methyl group at 5\u2019\u2019\u2019 (Scheme 1), which is present in the spectrum of clorobiocin was missing in compound 1. As in clorobiocin, the pyrrole protons at positions 3\u2019\u2019\u2019 and 4\u2019\u2019\u2019 cou-pled with each other; this resulted in doublet signals for both protons (J=3.6 Hz). The absence of the proton signal of H5\u2019\u2019\u2019, which is observed in novclobiocin 109 at 7.02 ppm,[13] as well as the multiplicity of the signals of H4\u2019\u2019\u2019 and H3\u2019\u2019\u2019 proved that no proton was present at 5\u2019\u2019\u2019, that is, the chlorine had been ACHTUNGTRENNUNGintroduced at this position. Correspondingly, the signal of H4\u2019\u2019\u2019 in compound 1 (6.12 ppm) showed a slight downfield shift in comparison to H4\u2019\u2019\u2019 of clorobiocin (5.94 ppm). Therefore, the structure shown in Scheme 2 was ACHTUNGTRENNUNGassigned to compound 1, which was then designated as novclobiocin 124.",
        "Compound 2 showed the same signals for the prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoyl moiety, the aminocoumarin moiety and the 5-chloropyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety as compound 1, includ-ing the doublet signals of the pyrrole protons H3\u2019\u2019\u2019 and H4\u2019\u2019\u2019 at 6.95 and 6.12 ppm, respectively. However, the chemical shift of the signals of the deoxysugar protons at 2\u2019\u2019 and 3\u2019\u2019 had changed markedly. The signal of the axial proton H3\u2019\u2019 (Scheme 1), which showed strong coupling with the axial H4\u2019\u2019 (J=10.5 Hz) had shifted upfield from 5.72 ppm (compound 1 and clorobiocin) to 4.45 ppm.

This showed that in compound 2 the 5-chloropyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety was attached to the 2\u2019\u2019-OH group rather than to the 3\u2019\u2019-OH group (Schemes 1 and 2). Similar 2\u2019\u2019-acylated com-pounds have been found in earlier studies[13,25, 26] and showed very similar NMR spectroscopic signals of H2\u2019\u2019 and H3\u2019\u2019 as com-pound 2. Therefore, the structure shown in Scheme 2 was as-signed to compound 2, and this second new clorobiocin deriv-atives was designated as novclobiocin 125.",
        "Antibacterial activity of the new clorobiocin derivatives The antibacterial activities of novclobiocin 124 and 125 were determined in a disc-diffusion assay against Bacillus subtilis and compared to authentic clorobiocin (Figure 3). Novclobiocin 124 showed similar activity as clorobiocin; this suggests that the 5-chloropyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety is nearly equivalent to the genuine 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety in ensur-",

In contrast, nov-clobiocin 109, which does not carry a substituent at position 5 of the pyrrole ring, has been found to be eight-times less active than clorobiocin.[13] Novclobiocin 125, with the 5-chloro-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety attached to the 2-OH group of the deoxysugar, showed only 25% of the activity of clorobio-cin.",
        "Discussion In the present study, expression of the halogenase gene hrmQ in a clorobiocin producer strain, which is defective in the 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-methyltransferase gene cloN6, was shown to result in the for-mation of 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-chlorinated clorobiocin derivatives. This finding supports the functional assignment of hrmQ to the halogena-tion reaction at position 5 of the pyrrole moiety of hormaomy-cin. Many FADH2-dependent halogenases have been putatively identified from DNA sequence data, but functional proof from biochemical experiments is only available for eight of these ACHTUNGTRENNUNGenzymes, and proof from genetic experiments for a further three.[5,27,28] Our study now provides functional proof for a fur-ther halogenase.",
        "For hormaomycin biosynthesis, no experimental data are available to indicate at which stage of the biosynthetic reac-tion sequence the halogenation of the pyrrole moiety takes place. However, investigations on the biosynthesis of pyolu-teorin in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 have revealed the mechanism of the formation of the 4,5-dichloropyrrole-2-car-bonyl moiety of that molecule (Scheme 2).[18] Proline is first ACHTUNGTRENNUNGadenylated under catalysis of the prolyl-AMP-ligase PltF, then transferred to the 4\u2019-phosphopantheteinyl cofactor of the small acyl carrier protein PltL and finally oxidised by the flavoprotein PltE to the pyrrole derivative. Subsequently, the FADH2-depen-dent halogenase PltA catalyses two successive halogenations at position 5 and 4 of the pyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[acyl carrier pro-tein] intermediate. HrmQ shows high sequence similarity with PltA (Table 1). Notably, both the hormaomycin and the cloro-biocin biosynthetic gene cluster also contain genes with se-quence similarity to the prolyl-AMP-ligase PltF, the acyl carrier protein PltL and the flavoprotein PltE. It appears therefore likely that in hormaomycin biosynthesis, HrmQ acts on a ACHTUNGTRENNUNGpyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[HrmL] thioester (Scheme 2), although no biochemical evidence has yet been provided for the HrmQ re-action.",
        "Detailed evidence is available on the function of the corre-sponding genes of clorobiocin biosynthesis.[29\u201333] In contrast to pyoluteorin biosynthesis, the formation of clorobiocin involves the successive attachment of the pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid moiety to two different acyl carrier proteins, that is, CloN5 and CloN1, before 5-methylation and transfer to the deoxysugar (Scheme 2).",
        "We expressed only the halogenase HrmQ, and not the acyl carrier protein HrmL in the mutated clorobiocin producer strain. Therefore, our transgenic strain HrmQ is expected to act on either pyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[CloN5] or pyrrole-2-carboxyl-S-[CloN1] (Scheme 2). HrmL, CloN5 and CloN1 are of similar size (91, 89 and 95 amino acids, respectively), and all contain the characteristic Asp ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(Asn)-Ser-Leu site for attachment of the 4\u2019-phosphopantheteinyl cofactor. However, HrmL shares only 29% sequence identity (and 57% sequence similarity) with CloN5, and no significant sequence similarity with CloN1. This difference between HrmL and CloN5/CloN1 might be responsi-ble for the relatively low yield of 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-chlorinated compounds obtained in the present study. In the strain that expressed the halogenase hrmQ, only about 5% of the aminocoumarin anti-biotics were accumulated in the form of 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-chlorinated com-pounds, while the major part remained in 5\u2019\u2019\u2019-unsubstituted form. In contrast, when we inactivated the methyltransferase genes novO and couO, which are responsible for 8\u2019-methylation of the aminocoumarin moieties of novobiocin and clorobiocin, and expressed the corresponding 8\u2019-halogenase from the cloro-biocin cluster in the resulting mutants, more than 75% of the aminocoumarins were accumulated as 8\u2019-chlorinated com-pounds.[7,9] In these two cases, the substrates of the halogena-tion reactions are likely to be identical to those of the methyla-tion reactions,[34,35] although the Clo-hal reaction has not yet been demonstrated in vitro.",
        "Figure 3. Antibacterial activity of novclobiocin 124 and 125 in comparison to",
        "It has been speculated that the use of halogenases for com-binatorial biosynthesis in vivo could be very problematic be-cause many of the substrates are halogenated only when teth-ered to an acyl carrier protein (ACP), and the substrate specific-ity of the halogenases might prevent their action on substrates bound to a heterologous ACP.[5] Our study suggests that in vivo halogenation of an ACP-bound substrate by a heterolo-gous halogenase is possible, and similar evidence has been provided from an in vitro study with PltA.[18]",
        "The amino acid sequences of several halogenases that act on different ACP-bound substrates are extremely similar (Table 1 and Figure S1). This offers prospects for both combina-torial biosynthesis and for directed evolution of such enzymes. In contrast, the FADH2-dependent halogenases acting on free aromatic substrates show little sequence similarity to HrmQ, even if they also chlorinate pyrrole moieties (Table 1). These enzymes are unlikely to accept ACP-bound pyrroles. In our ex-periment, the mutant strain used for hrmQ expression con-tained an active halogenase, Clo-hal,[17] even before the intro-duction of the hrmQ expression plasmid pLW42. However, by using LC\u2013MS analysis novclobiocin 124 and 125 could not be detected in the strain that lacked pLW42; this proves that the substrate specificity of Clo-hal allowed, as expected, only the halogenation of the aminocoumarin moiety, and not of the pyrrole moiety.",
        "Hormaomycin biosynthesis involves not only the 5-chlorina-tion but also the N-hydroxylation of the pyrrole moiety (Scheme 1). However, LC\u2013MS analysis of the DcloN6 mutant ex-pressing hrmQ did not show any N-hydroxylated analogues of novclobiocin 124 and 125. This suggests that a further enzyme is required for the N-hydroxylation of the pyrrole moieties in hormaomycin biosynthesis.",
        "Halogenation is a powerful tool, both in synthetic medicinal chemistry and in secondary metabolism in nature, to modify the physical and chemical properties and thereby the bioactivi-ties of small molecules. With our growing knowledge of the mechanism of biological halogenations, and the rapidly grow-ing number of known genes for halogenases with different substrate specificities, halogenases may become a useful tool for combinatorial biosynthesis.",
        "Experimental Section Bacterial strains and culture conditions : E. coli XL1 Blue MRF\u2019 (Stratagene) was used for cloning experiments and grown in liquid or on solid Luria\u2013Bertani medium (1.5% agar) at 37 8C.[36] The mutant strain S. roseochromogenes var. oscitans (DcloN6) has been described previously.[13] Thiostrepton (12 mgmLNone1 for solid media and 40 mgmLNone1 for liquid media) and carbenicillin (50\u2013100 mgmLNone1) were used for selection of recombinant strains. DNA isolation, manipulation and cloning : Standard methods for DNA isolation and manipulation were performed as described by Sambrook and Russell[36] and by Kieser et al.[37] Isolation of plasmids was carried out with ion exchange columns (Nucleobond AX kits, Macherey\u2013Nagel, DOren, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Construction of plasmid pLW42 : The E. coli\u2013Streptomyces shuttle vector pUWL201, which contained the ermE* promoter,[23] was used for the construction of the expression plasmid pLW42. The gene hrmQ was amplified by PCR. A HindIII site was introduced before the start codon by using primer hrmQ_F (5\u2019-AAGCTTAT-GAGCGACTTCGACTACGAC-3\u2019). At the C terminus, an XbaI restric-tion site was introduced after the stop codon by using primer hrmQ_R (5\u2019-TCTAGATGGGCGAGCTCAGAAGAGCGG-3\u2019). Bold letters represent the introduced restriction sites. PCR amplification was performed in a 50 mL volume with template (600 ng), dNTPs (0.2 mm), each primer (10 pmol) and DMSO (5%, v/v) with the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals): denaturation at 94 8C for 2 min, 24 cycles with denaturation at 94 8C for 1 min, annealing at 68 8C for 45 s and elongation at 72 8C for 90 s, followed by the last elongation step at 72 8C for 5 min. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega); this resulted in pLW41. The plasmid pLW41 was digested with ACHTUNGTRENNUNG indIII and XbaI and subsequently hrmQ was cloned into the same sites of pUWL201 to give pLW42.",
