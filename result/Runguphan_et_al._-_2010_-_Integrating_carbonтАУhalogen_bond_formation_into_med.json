O\u2019Connor1 Halogenation, which was once considered a rare occurrence in nat-ure, has now been observed in many natural product biosynthetic pathways1. However, only a small fraction of halogenated com-pounds have been isolated from terrestrial plants2. Given the impact that halogenation can have on the biological activity of natural pro-ducts1, we reasoned that the introduction of halides into medicinal plant metabolism would provide the opportunity to rationally bioengineer a broad variety of novel plant products with altered, and perhaps improved, pharmacological properties. Here we report that chlorination biosynthetic machinery from soil bacteria can be successfully introduced into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). These prokaryotic halogenases function within the context of the plant cell to generate chlorinated tryptophan, which is then shuttled into monoterpene indole alkaloid metabolism to yield chlorinated alkaloids. A new functional group\u2014 a halide\u2014is thereby introduced into the complex metabolism of C. roseus, and is incorporated in a predictable and regioselective manner onto the plant alkaloid products. Medicinal plants, despite their genetic and developmental complexity, therefore seem to be a viable platform for synthetic biology efforts. Numerous halogenase enzymes from soil bacteria have been iden-tified and characterized extensively1,3\u20135. Two of these flavoenzymes, PyrH6,7 and RebH8\u201311, chlorinate the indole ring of tryptophan in the five and seven positions, respectively. Transferring these enzymes into other natural product pathways would allow site-specific incorpora-tion of halogens onto a range of tryptophan-derived alkaloid pro-ducts12, provided that the downstream enzymes could accommodate the chlorinated tryptophan precursor. Catharanthus roseus produces a wide variety of monoterpene indole alkaloids13 (Fig. 1a). This metabolic pathway begins with the conver-sion of tryptophan (1) to tryptamine (2) by tryptophan decarboxy-lase14. Tryptamine then condenses with the iridoid terpene *These authors contributed equally to this work. 1Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA. {Present address: State Key Laboratory of Bioorganic and Natural Products Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 345 Lingling Road, Shanghai 200032, China.

After numerous rearrangements, strictosidine (4) is converted into a variety of monoterpene indole alkaloids, such as 19,20-dihydroakuammicine (5), ajmalicine (6), tabersonine (7) and catharanthine (8). These compounds have a variety of pharmacological activities24\u201326,30.

Here we show that after transformation of these enzymes into C. roseus, the halogenated tryptophans 1a and 1b can be decarboxylated by tryptophan decarboxylase (C. roseus) to form the chlorotryptamines 2a and 2b and then converted into chlorinated monoterpene indole alkaloids. 1 8 N O V E M B E R 2 0 1 0 | V O L 4 6 8 | N A T U R E | 4 6 1 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights secologanin (3) to form a biosynthetic intermediate strictosidine (4), which is subsequently functionalized in C. roseus to form over 100 alkaloids, including the anticancer agent vinblastine13. Previous work has shown that when C. roseus cell culture is supplemented with a variety of halogenated tryptamines, the corresponding halogenated alkaloid analogues are produced in isolable yields15,16. If prokaryotic halogenases could function in the eukaryotic plant cell, and if trypto-phan decarboxylase could convert halogenated tryptophan into halo-genated tryptamine, then C. roseus would produce chlorinated alkaloids de novo (Fig. 1b). Because RebH and PyrH do not turn over tryptamine, this strategy requires that tryptophan decarboxylase from C. roseus recognize halo-genated tryptophan. We assayed tryptophan decarboxylase from C. roseus in vitro with tryptophan (Km 5 51.7 6 9.2mM (Michaelis constant), kcat 5 5.1 6 0.1 min 21 (turnover number), kcat/Km 5 0.099mM21 min21), 7-chlorotryptophan (1a; Km 5 499 6 74mM, kcat 5 1.6 6 0.04 min 21, kcat/Km 5 0.00327mM 21 min21) and 5-chlor-otryptophan (1b; Km 5 538 6 48mM, kcat 5 2.5 6 0.08 min 21, kcat/ Km 5 0.00455mM 21 min21) (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). The activity of the enzyme suggested that halogenated tryptophan could be decar-boxylated in vivo. When considering how to merge the prokaryotic biosynthetic machinery with the plant alkaloid pathway, we chose to transfer the halogenase enzymes into C. roseus rather than move the plant biosyn-thetic enzymes into a microbial host. Most of the monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthetic genes have not been identified, making hetero-logous expression of this pathway impossible at present. Moreover, we note that reconstitution of plant alkaloid pathways continues to be a challenge17,18. Many alkaloids use complex starting materials (such as secologanin) that are only produced by a few specialized plants, so 12-chloro-19,20-dihydro-akuammicine (5a) standardWild-type lineRebF\u2013RebH In te ns ity Time (min)1.6 m/z 359 m/z 359 m/z 359 a In te ns ity Time (min)Wild-type linePyrH\u2013RebF\u2013 STRvm 10-chloro-ajmalicine (6b)standard m/z 387 m/z 387 m/z 387 b 1H NMR2.4 2.61.8 2.0 2.2 2.8 3.0 3.2 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 In te ns ity Time (min)Wild-type linePyrH\u2013RebF\u2013 STRvm c m/z 371 m/z 371 m/z 371 15-chloro-tabersonine (7b)10-chloro-catharanthine (8b)8.0 7.5 7.0 6.5 8.0 7.57.5 7.4 7.3 7.2 7.1 7.0 6.9 7.5 7.4 7.3 7.2 7.1 7.0 6.9 7.0 6.5 110 130 140 120 110 130 120 140 H10 H9H11 H9H11 1H\u201313C HSQCH11 H9 H10 H11 H9 H10 5a 5c 1H f1 (p.p.m.) 1H f1 (p.p.m.) f1 (p.p.m.) 13 C  f2 (p.p .m .)  13 C  f2 (p.p .m .)  d H10 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 Figure 2 | Chlorinated alkaloids in C. roseus hairy root culture. a, LC\u2013MS chromatograms showing 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine (5a; m/z 359) in RebF\u2013RebH hairy roots (red trace), contrasted with control cultures transformed with no plasmid (purple trace).

All rights reconstitution of plant alkaloid pathways must also include biosyn-thesis of these precursors. For example, ajmalicine (6; Fig. 1a), one of the simplest of the monoterpene indole alkaloids, requires an esti-mated 14 discrete enzymes for biosynthesis from tryptophan and the terpene geraniol13; reconstitution of a pathway of this length is a sig-nificant engineering problem. Therefore, we believe that exploring approaches in the host plant is an important aspect of alkaloid meta-bolic engineering efforts. To produce 7-chlorotryptophan in planta, we generated an express-ion construct containing codon-optimized complementary DNA encoding the 7-tryptophan chlorinase RebH and its required partner flavin reductase, RebF, in a plant expression vector (pCAMBIA1300), both under the control of constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoters. For production of 5-chlorotryptophan, an expression construct encoding the 5-chlorinating enzyme PyrH, along with RebF as the partner reductase, was generated. No signal sequence was added to the halogenase genes, to ensure that RebH, PyrH and RebF would produce chlorinated tryptophan in the cytosol, where it would most readily encounter the decarboxylase, which is also loca-lized in the cytosol19 (Supplementary Figs 3\u20135). We used Agrobacterium rhizogenes to generate hairy root culture of C. roseus transformed with the halogenase genes20. One of the early biosynthetic enzymes, strictosidine synthase, cannot turn over 5-chlor-otryptamine21 (2b). Therefore, when transforming C. roseus with pyrH and rebF, we also introduced a mutant of strictosidine synthase (STRvm) that can convert 5-chlorotryptamine to 10-chlorostrictosi-dine16,22 (4b). After a selection process, we cultivated the transformed root culture on standard Gamborg\u2019s B5 plant medium and monitored chlorinated alkaloids using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS). We observed formation of chlorinated tryptophans 1a and 1b and chlorinated alkaloids in both the RebH\u2013RebF and PyrH\u2013RebF\u2013 STRvm hairy root lines (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 6\u201315). These results indicate that RebH, PyrH and the partner reductase function productively in the plant cell environment, demonstrating that the flavin halogenases are highly transportable among kingdoms. Because chlorinated alkaloid production was observed in the trans-formed lines, we conclude that tryptophan decarboxylase can compe-tently turn over halogenated tryptophan substrates in vivo. Hairy roots transformed with RebH and RebF, which produce 7-chlorotryptophan, yielded a major chlorinated product at m/z 359 (Fig. 2a). An authentic standard of 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuam-micine (5a) co-eluted with this compound. Natural products contain-ing the akuammicine scaffold have a variety of pharmacological activities23\u201325. Although the parent compound, 19,20-dihydroakuam-micine (5) has been isolated in good yields from other plants26, it is not a major alkaloid in C. roseus hairy root culture. However, when wild-type C. roseus cell lines were incubated with 7-chlorotryptamine, 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine was also the major chlorinated product (Supplementary Fig. 16). Therefore, the predominance of 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine in the RebH\u2013RebF hairy root line is probably due to substrate specificity of downstream enzymes for 7-chlorotryptamine. A hairy root line transformed with the 5-chloro-tryptophan enzyme system, PyrH, RebF and STRvm, produced a variety of chlorinated alkaloids (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Two representative chlori-nated alkaloids, 10-chloroajmalicine (6b) and 15-chlorotabersonine (7b), were identified by co-elution with authentic standards21. Chlorinated alkaloid production seemed to be stable over the course of at least six subcultures. The alkaloid 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroa-kuammicine was produced at 26 6 4mg per gram of fresh root weight of a representative cell line averaged over six subcultures. For compar-ison, wild-type cell lines produced ,25mg per gram of fresh tissue weight of chlorinated alkaloids when the medium was supplemented with 200mM 7-chlorotryptamine (2a). Similarly, 10-chloroajmalicine and 15-chlorotabersonine (7b) were produced at 2.8 6 0.9 and 4.0 6 1.0mg per gram of fresh root weight, respectively, for a repres-entative cell line averaged over four subcultures (Supplementary Figs 12 and 14). Different concentrations of KCl (3mM\u201320 mM) were added to the medium, but increasing amounts of exogenous chloride salt did not significantly affect the yields of chlorinated alkaloids (Supplementary Figs 17 and 18). Previous reports demonstrated that RebH can use bromide to yield brominated tryptophan8 (1c). To assess the capacity of RebH for bro-mination in vivo, we supplemented a low-chloride cell culture medium with KBr. The in vitro halide specificity of RebH correlated with the products generated in vivo, as we observed the formation of a com-pound that co-eluted with an authentic standard of 12-bromo-19,20-dihydroakuammicine (5c) (21 6 8 and 49 6 20mg per gram of fresh root weight with 10 mM and 20 mM KBr supplementation, respect-ively; Fig. 3). In contrast, supplementation of the medium with KI failed to yield either iodinated tryptophan or iodinated alkaloids. Again, this correlated with in vitro studies showing that RebH does not accept iodide as a substrate8 (Supplementary Figs 19\u201322). We also measured the transcript levels of the heterologous enzymes by real-time PCR with reverse transcription. The production of halo-genated compounds depended on the expression of both RebF and RebH or PyrH. Notably, when the strictosidine synthase mutant STRvm was not expressed in the PyrH\u2013RebF hairy root lines, we observed accumulation of 5-chlorotryptophan (representative cell line, 9 6 1mg per gram of fresh root weight) and 5-chlorotryptamine (rep-resentative cell line, 20 6 9mg per gram of fresh root weight), but did not observe downstream alkaloids (Supplementary Figs 23 and 24). Tryptophan does not seem to accumulate in either wild-type or transformed hairy roots. However, accumulation of 7-chlorotrypto-phan (50 6 12mg per gram of fresh root weight for a representative RebH\u2013RebF cell line) and 5-chlorotryptophan (8 6 2mg per gram of fresh root weight for a representative PyrH\u2013RebF\u2013STRvm cell line) was observed, suggesting that decarboxylation of chlorinated trypto-phan is a bottleneck in vivo, a step that could potentially be subjected to future engineering efforts.

The morphologies of the halogen producing lines were thicker and slower growing than those of wild-type lines (Supplementary Fig. 25). Because tryptophan serves as the precursor for other small-molecule metabolites, we speculate that chlorinated tryptophan may be diverted into other pathways such as auxins. Notably, 4-chloro indole acetic acid, which is found in several species of pea, has altered activity relative to the auxin indole acetic acid27,28. Medicinal plants produce a wide range of complex natural products but generate relatively few halogenated compounds; chlorinated or brominated compounds are not found among the approximately 3,000 known monoterpene indole alkaloids produced by plants in the Apocynaceae, Rubiaceae and Loganiaceae families. The halogena-tion of natural products often has profound effects on the bioactivity of the compound, and can serve as a useful handle for further chemical derivatization1,29. Despite the metabolic and developmental complex-ity of plant tissue, transformation of these prokaryotic genes led to the regioselective incorporation of halides into the alkaloid products of the existing plant pathway. Notably, the yield of chlorinated alkaloids in the most productive lines (,26mg per gram of fresh weight of plant tissue) is only 15-fold lower than the yield of total natural alkaloids (compounds 5, 6, 7 and 8) from wild-type tissue (,420mg per gram of fresh weight of plant tissue) (Supplementary Fig. 26). The ease with which we engineered the successful production of chlorinated alka-loids in C. roseus, a plant with limited genetic characterization, indi-cates that medicinal plants can provide a viable platform for synthetic biology. METHODS SUMMARY Structural characterization is shown in Supplementary Figs 27\u201332 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Generation of transgenic C. roseus hairy root cultures. We transformed the expression construct pCAMRebHRebF into A. rhizogenes ATCC 15834 by elec-troporation (1-mm cuvette, 1.25 kV), and we co-transformed pCAMPyrHRebF and pCAMSTRvm into A. rhizogenes ATCC 15834 by electroporation. Transformation of C. roseus seedlings with the generated Agrobacterium strains was performed as previously reported20. Evaluation of alkaloid production in transgenic C. roseus hairy roots. Every transgenic hairy root line that survived hygromycin selection medium was evalu-ated for alkaloid production. Transformed hairy roots were grown in Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, 6 g l21 agar, pH 5.7). The total chloride concentration in Gamborg\u2019s B5 formulation was ,1 mM. We ground three-week-old hairy roots with a mortar, pestle and 106-mm acid-washed glass beads in methanol (10 ml g21 fresh weight of hairy roots). The crude natural product mixtures were filtered through 0.2-mm cellulose acetate membrane (VWR) and subsequently subjected to LC\u2013MS analysis. Hairy roots transformed with wild-type A. rhizogenes lacking the plasmid were also evaluated. Brominated alkaloid production in transgenic C. roseus hairy roots. We grew a selected transformed hairy root line for two weeks in low-chloride solid medium (67 mg l21 (NH4)2SO4, 353 mg l 21 Ca(NO3)2?4H2O, 61 mg l 21 MgSO4, 1,250 mg l21 KNO3, half-strength Murashige and Skoog micronutrient salts and full-strength Murashige and Skoog vitamins, 3mM total chloride concentration). Hairy roots were transferred to the same medium supplemented with either pot-assium bromide or potassium iodide (10\u201320 mM final concentration) and culti-vated for an additional two weeks. They were then processed and alkaloid production was analysed as described above (Supplementary Figs 12\u201315). We performed experiments in duplicate.

RESEARCH LETTER 4 6 4 | N A T U R E | V O L 4 6 8 | 1 8 N O V E M B E R 2 0 1 0 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights METHODS Heterologous expression and purification of C. roseus tryptophan decarbox-ylase. The tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) gene (accession number M25151.1) was obtained by reverse-transcription PCR (RT\u2013PCR) amplification of mRNA isolated from C. roseus hairy root culture (Invitrogen, Dynabeads mRNA direct kit) with PCR primers that introduce sites for NdeI and XhoI (underlined): 59-AAAAAACATATGGGCAGCATTGATTCAACA-39 and 59-AAAAAACTCGA GTCAAGCTTCTTTGAGCAAATC-39. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega), and then excised and ligated into the NdeI/ XhoI site of the pET28-a plasmid (Novagen). The resulting pET28a\u2013TDC con-struct was subsequently transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS electrocompetent Escherichia coli (Promega). A single E. coli colony harbouring pET28a\u2013TDC was inoculated in 5 ml lysogeny broth medium supplemented with kanamycin (0.05 mg l21) and incubated overnight at 37 uC with shaking at 225 r.p.m. An aliquot of the overnight culture (1 ml) was then used to inoculate 100 ml lysogeny broth medium supplemented with kanamycin (0.05 mg l21) and incubated at 37 uC with shaking at 225 r.p.m. until OD600 0.6 was reached. Cells were induced for overexpression by the addition of isopropyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG; final concentration, 1 mM) and the culture was allowed to continue growth for 16 h at 18 uC. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The hexahistidine-tagged TDC was purified using Ni-NTA Spin Kit (Qiagen) using manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Supplementary Fig. 1). Eluted enzyme was subse-quently buffer-exchanged into phosphate buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and immediately assayed for activity. This enzyme was not stable after extended storage. Determining the steady-state kinetic constants of TDC for tryptophan sub-strate analogues, 5-and 7-chlorotryptophan (1b and 1a). Steady-state kinetic constants of TDC for 5-and 7-chlorotryptophan (1b and 1a) (Amatek) were determined in phosphate buffer (0.1 M NaH2PO4, 3.5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5) containing 1 mM pyridoxal-59-phosphate at 30 uC (0.3-ml reaction volume) with TDC concentrations appropriate for obtaining the initial rate of the reaction (0.6\u20130.9mM). Aliquots (25ml) were quenched in 1 ml methanol, containing yohimbine (500 nM) as an internal standard, at appropriate time points. The samples were centrifuged (13,000 r.p.m. (16,000g), 5 min) to remove particulates and then analysed by LC\u2013MS. Samples were ionized by ESI with a Micromass LCT Premier TOF Mass Spectrometer. The liquid chromatography was performed on an Acquity Ultra Performance BEH C18, 1.7mm, 2.1 3 100 mm column on a gradient of 10\u201390% acetonitrile/water (0.1% formic acid) over 5 min at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min21. The appearance of the corresponding tryptamine analogues (either 5-or 7-chlorotryptamine) was monitored by peak integration and normalized to the internal standard. 5-chlorotryptamine was obtained from a commercial source (Alfa Aesar). 7-chlorotryptamine was synthesized as prev-iously reported3. Eight substrate concentrations (200\u20132,500mM) were tested for 7-chlorotryptophan substrate, and six substrate concentrations (200\u20131,200mM) were tested for 5-chlorotryptophan substrate. Each concentration was assayed three times and the average values are reported with standard deviations. The data were fitted using nonlinear regression to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation using ORIGINPRO 7 (OriginLab). For reference, the kinetic constants for the natural substrate tryptophan (1) were also measured at concentrations ranging from 15 to 350mM (Supplementary Fig. 2). Construction of halogenase plant expression vectors PyrH\u2013RebF\u2013STRvm and RebH\u2013RebF. The construction of plant expression vectors is summarized below and in Supplementary Fig. 3. (i) The CaMV35S:Gus:NosPolyA fragment was obtained by PCR amplification of pCAMBIA1305.1 (Cambia) with forward and reverse PCR primers CaMV35S-NosPolyA that introduce sites for XbaI and KpnI at the 59 end, and PstI and SpeI at the 39 end (underlined): 59-ACTTCTAGAGGTACCGGATCCTCTAGAGTCG ACCTGCAG-39 and 59-ATTCTGCAGACTAGTCCCGATCTAGTAACATAG ATGACACCG-39. (ii) The tryptophan 5-halogenase gene (pyrH; accession number AAU95674) was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from Streptomyces rugosporus NRRL 21084 with forward and reverse PCR primers CrPyrH that introduce sites for XhoI and NcoI at the 59 end, and SpeI and BstEII at the 39 end (underlined): 59-ACTCTCGAGCCATGGATATCCGATCTGTGGTGATCG-39 and 59-ACTACTAGTGGTAACCTCATTGGATGCTGGCGAGGTA-39. (iii) The flavin reductase gene (rebF; accession number BAC15756) was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from Lechevalieria aerocoloni-genes ATCC 39243 with forward and reverse PCR primers CrRebF that introduce sites for XhoI and NcoI at the 59 end, and SpeI and PmlI at the 39 end (underlined): 59-ACTCTCGAGCCATGGATACGATCGAGTTCGACAGAC-39 and 59-ACT ACTAGTCACGTGTCATCCCTCCGGTGTCCACAC-39. (iv) The tryptophan 7-halogenase gene (rebH; accession number BAC15758) was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243 with forward and reverse PCR primers CrRebH that introduce sites for SpeI and NcoI at the 59 end, and SpeI and PmlI at the 39 end (underlined): 59-AAGACTACTAGTCCATGGATTCCGGCAAGATTGAC-39 and 59-ACTACTAGTCACGTGTCAGCGGCCGTGCTGTTGCC-39. CaMV35S:Gus:NosPolyA, PyrH, RebH and RebF PCR fragments were indi-vidually ligated into pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) to yield pGEMCaMV35S, pGEMPyrH, pGEMRebH and pGEMRebF, respectively. (v) Codon-optimization for C. roseus was performed to ensure efficient expression of the prokaryotic halogenase and flavin reductase genes in plant cell culture. Using codon usage database software (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/), the fol-lowing codons were identified as occurring at low frequency (triplet, frequency per thousand): GCG, 4.8; CGG, 3.3; ACG, 4.0; TCG, 6.1; CCG, 6.0; and CCC, 6.7. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit to replace rare codons with the most frequently occur-ring codons encoding the corresponding amino acids. Only codons that appeared within the first 300 nucleotides of the genes were subjected to mutagenesis. The site-directed-mutagenesis primers (name, sequence) were as follows (the sites of mutation are underlined): PyrH-SDM-for1, 59-GTGGGTGGTGGC ACTGCTGGCTGGATGACC-39; PyrH-SDM-rev1, 59-GGTCATCCAGCCAGC AGTGCCACCACCCAC-39; PyrH-SDM-for2, 59-GACATGCGGCCGTACAC TACTGCTACCGCGATGAGCGCCGGC-39; PyrH-SDM-rev2, 59-GCCGGCG CTCATCGCGGTAGCAGTAGTGTACGGCCGCATGTC-39; RebH-SDM-for, 59-CCCCAATCTGCAGACTGCTTTCTTCGACTTCCTCGGA-39; RebH-SDM-rev, 59-TCCGAGGAAGTCGAAGAAAGCAGTCTGCAGATTGGGG-39; RebF-SDM-for1, 59-ACCGCGGCCGATCACAGGGCTCTGATGAGCCTGTTTCCC-39; RebF-SDM-rev1, 59-GGGAAACAGGCTCATCAGAGCCCTGTGATCGGCC GCGGT-39; RebF-SDM-for2, 59-CTCGTCTGCCTGAACAGGGCTAGCGGAA CGTTGCAC-39; RebF-SDM-rev2, 59-GTGCAACGTTCCGCTAGCCCTGTTC AGGCAGACGAG-39. (vi) pGEMCaMV35S was digested and ligated into the KpnI/EcoRI sites of pSP72 vector (Promega) to yield pSPCaMV35S. (vii) pGEMRebH and pGEMRebF were digested and ligated into the NcoI/PmlI sites of pSPCaMV35S to yield pSPRebH and pSPRebF, respectively. Similarly, pGEMPyrH was digested and ligated into the NcoI/BstEII sites of pSPCaMV35S to yield pSPPyrH. pSPRebF was then digested and ligated into the PstI site of pSP72 to yield pSPRebF_2. (viii) pSPRebH and pSPPyrH were digested and ligated into the XbaI/EcoRI sites of pSPRebF_2 to yield pSPRebHRebF and pSPPyrHRebF, respectively. Finally, both pSPRebHRebF and pSPPyrHRebF were digested and ligated into the SpeI site of pCAMBIA1300A to yield pCAMRebHRebF and pCAMPyrHRebF. pCAMBIA1300A was constructed by introducing an SpeI restriction into pCAMBIA1300 (Cambia). The site-directed-mutagenesis primers are (SpeI site underlined) 59-CCCGCCTTCAGTTTAAACTAGTCAGTGTTTGACAGGAT-39 and 59-atcctgtcaaacactgACTAGTttaaactgaaggcggg-39. pCAMSTRvm was constructed as previously described21. Generation of transgenic C. roseus hairy root cultures. The plant expression construct pCAMRebHRebF was transformed into A. rhizogenes ATCC 15834 by means of electroporation (1-mm cuvette, 1.25 kV). pCAMPyrHRebF and pCAMSTRvm were co-transformed into A. rhizogenes ATCC 15834 via electro-poration (1mm cuvette, 1.25 kV). Transformation of C. roseus seedlings with the generated Agrobacterium strains was performed as previously reported31. Briefly, 180\u2013250 C. roseus seedlings (Vinca Little Bright Eyes, Nature Hills Nursery) were germinated aseptically on Gamborg\u2019s B5 medium (full-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, pH 5.7) and grown in a 16-h light, 8-h dark cycle at 26 uC for 3 weeks. Seedlings were then wounded with extra-fine forceps at the stem tip, and 3\u20135ml A. rhizogenes from a freshly grown liquid culture were inoculated on the wound. Hairy roots appeared at the wound site 2\u20133 weeks after infection for about 80% of the seedlings infected. After hairy roots reached 1\u20134 cm in length (usually about 6 weeks after infection), they were excised and transferred to Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, 6 g l21 agar, pH 5.7) containing hygromycin (0.03 mg ml21) for selection and the anti-biotic cefotaxime (0.25 mg ml21) to remove remaining bacteria. The total chloride concentration in Gamborg\u2019s B5 formulation was 1 mM. All cultures were grown in the dark at 26 uC. After the hygromycin selection process, hairy roots were main-tained in solid medium lacking both hygromycin and cefotaxime. To adapt the line to liquid culture, approximately 200 mg of hairy roots (typ-ically five 3\u20134-cm-long stem tips) from each line that grew successfully on solid medium were transferred to 50 ml of half-strength Gamborg\u2019s B5 liquid medium. The cultures were grown at 26 uC in the dark at 125 r.p.m. Hairy root growth in liquid medium seemed to be slower than that in solid medium. Hairy root trans-formants were screened for survival in solid medium supplemented with hygro-mycin. The number of transformants decreased significantly after solid medium LETTER RESEARCH Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights selection for each of the constructs transformed. Every line that grew in the selection medium was analysed for alkaloid production. Hairy root selection and adaptation processes. For the plasmid pCAMRebH/ RebF, the number of transformed hairy roots was 200 and the number of hairy roots after solid medium selection was 31. For the plasmid pCAMPyrH/RebF/ STRvm, the number of transformed hairy roots was 140 and the number of hairy roots after solid medium selection was 57. Verification of transferred DNA integration by genomic DNA analysis. To verify the integration of transferred DNA (T-DNA) into the plant genome, the genomic DNA from transformed hairy roots was isolated (Qiagen DNeasy kit) and then subjected to PCR amplification using T-DNA-specific primers with TDC primers serving as a positive control (see below). Specifically, for the pCAMRebHRebF hairy roots, primers for PCR amplification were designed to amplify the complete TDC gene (TDC_for and TDC_rev), a 660-base-pair (bp) region of the RebH gene (RebH_for and RebH_rev), a 680-bp region of the RebF gene (RebF_for and RebF_rev) and an 800-bp region of the selection marker HPT gene (HPT_for and HPT_rev) (see below). PCR primers for verification of T-DNA integration of transformed hairy roots were as follows (name, sequence): TDC_for, 59-AAAAAACATATGGGCAGC ATTGATTCAACA-39; TDC_rev, 59-AAAAAACTCGAGTCAAGCTTCTTTG AGCAAATC-39; RebH_for, 59-GTCTTCGATGCCGACCTCTTC-39; RebH_rev, 59-GTACATGTCGATCTTCTCCTGC-39; RebF_for, 59-TAGAGGACCTAACAG AAC-39; RebF_rev, 59-CGTGACACTGGTCAGGGA-39; HPT_for, 59-GCCTGA ACTCACCGCGACGTC-39; HPT_rev, 59-CCTCCAGAAGAAGATGTTGGC-39. PCR amplification of genomic DNA from all of the selected transformed lines (pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 4, lanes 1\u20134; pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 5, lanes 5\u20138; pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 6, lanes 9\u201312; pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 10, lanes 13\u2013 16; and pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 11, lanes 17\u201320) was successful for all four sets of primers (Supplementary Fig. 4). PCR amplification of hairy root transformed with A. rhizogenes lacking the pCAMBIA vector (provided by Professor Jacqueline Shanks (Iowa State University) and Professor Carolyn Lee-Parsons (Northeastern University)) genomic DNA was successful only when TDC-specific primers were used (lanes 21\u201324). These results indicated that rebH and rebF were successfully incorporated into the C. roseus genome in all chosen lines. For the pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm hairy roots, primers for PCR amplification were designed to amplify the complete TDC gene (TDC_for and TDC_rev), the complete PyrH gene (PyrH_for and PyrH_rev), a 680-bp region of the RebF gene (RebF_for and RebF_rev), a 440-bp region of the STRvm gene and an 800-bp region of the selection marker HPT gene (HPT_for and HPT_rev) (see below and Supplementary Fig. 5). PCR primers for verification of T-DNA integration of transformed hairy roots were as follows (name, sequence): TDC_for, 59-AAAAAACATATGGGC AGCATTGATTCAACA-39; TDC_rev, 59-AAAAAACTCGAGTCAAGCTTCT TTGAGCAAATC-3; PyrH_for, 59-ATGATCCGATCTGTGGTG-3; PyrH_rev, 59-TCATTGGATGCTGGCGAG-3; RebF_for, 59-TAGAGGACCTAACAGAAC-3; RebF_rev, 59-CGTGACACTGGTCAGGGA-3; STRvm_for, 59-CCTTATTATT GAAAGAGCTACATATG-3; STRvm_rev, 59-GCTAGAAACATAAGAATTTCC CTTG-3; HPT_for, 59-GCCTGAACTCACCGCGACGTC-3; HPT_rev, 59-CCTCC AGAAGAAGATGTTGGC-3. PCR amplification of genomic DNA from three of four of the selected trans-formed lines (pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm cell line 1, lanes 1\u20135; pCAMPyrH/RebF/ STRvm cell line 3, lanes 6\u201310, pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm cell line 6, lanes 11\u201315) was successful for all five sets of primers (Supplementary Fig. 5). PCR amplifica-tion of genomic DNA from pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm cell line 7 (lanes 16\u201320) was successful when TDC, PyrH, RebF and HPT primers were used but not when STRvm primers were used. PCR amplification of hairy root transformed with A. rhizogenes lacking the pCAMBIA vector genomic DNA was successful only when TDC specific primers were used (lanes 21\u201325). Evaluation of alkaloid production in transgenic C. roseus hairy roots. Every transgenic hairy root line that survived hygromycin selection medium was eval-uated for alkaloid production. Transformed hairy roots were grown in Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, 6 g l21 agar, pH 5.7). The total chloride concentration in Gamborg\u2019s B5 formula-tion was ,1 mM. Three-week-old hairy roots were ground with a mortar, pestle and 106mm acid-washed glass beads in methanol (10 ml g21 of fresh hairy root weight). The crude natural product mixtures were filtered through 0.2-mm cel-lulose acetate membrane (VWR) and subsequently subjected to LC\u2013MS analysis. Additionally, hairy roots transformed with wild-type A. rhizogenes lacking the plasmid were also evaluated. These crude alkaloid mixtures were diluted 30:830 with methanol for mass spectral analysis. Samples were ionized by ESI with a Micromass LCT Premier TOF Mass Spectrometer. The liquid chromatography was performed on an Acquity Ultra Performance BEH C18, 1.7mm, 2.1 3 100 mm column on a gradient of 10\u201390% acetonitrile/water (0.1% TFA) over 5 min at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min21. The capillary and sample cone voltages were 1,300 and 60 V, respectively. The desolvation and source temperature were 300 and 100 uC, respectively. The cone and desolvation gas flow rates were 60 and 800 l per hour, respectively. Analysis was performed with MASSLYNX 4.1. Accurate mass measurements were obtained in W-mode. The spectra were processed using the MASSLYNX 4.1 mass measure, in which the mass spectrum of peaks of interest was smoothed and centred with TOF mass correction, locking on the reference infusion of reserpine. Data for RebF\u2013RebH lines are shown in extracted LC\u2013MS chromatograms in Supplementary Figs 6\u201310. Feeding of 7-chlorotryptamine (2a) in control C. roseus hairy root cultures transformed with no plasmid. Alkaloid accumulation levels in hairy roots trans-formed with RebH and RebF were compared with alkaloid accumulation levels in control hairy root fed with 7-chlorotryptamine. The control hairy root line was grown for 2 weeks in half-strength Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium. Hairy roots were then transferred to the same medium supplemented with 7-chlorotryptamine (2a; 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 750mM final concentrations) and grown for a further 1 week. Hairy roots were then processed and alkaloid production analysed as described in the previous subsection (Supplementary Fig. 16). Feeding studies were performed in duplicate. Brominated alkaloid production in transgenic C. roseus hairy roots. A selected transformed hairy root line was grown for 2 weeks in low-chloride solid medium (67 mg l21 (NH4)2SO4, 353 mg l 21 Ca(NO3)2?4H2O, 61 mg l 21 MgSO4, 1,250 mg l21 KNO3, half-strength Murashige and Skoog micronutrient salts and full-strength Murashige and Skoog vitamins, 3mM total chloride concentration). Hairy roots were transferred to the same medium supplemented with either pot-assium bromide or potassium iodide (10\u201320 mM final concentration) and culti-vated for an additional 2 weeks. Hairy roots were then processed and alkaloid production analysed as described in the previous subsection but one. Hairy roots transformed with wild-type A. rhizogenes lacking the plasmid were also evaluated (Supplementary Figs 19\u201322). Experiments were performed in duplicate. Purification and isolation of alkaloids from transformed TDC suppressed hairy roots supplemented with 7-chlorotryptamine and 7-bromotryptamine. To obtain chlorinated and brominated alkaloid standards, root tips (10\u201315) from TDC suppressed hairy roots32 were subcultured in six 50 ml Gamborg\u2019s B5 liquid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, pH 5.7) and grown at 26 uC in the dark at 125 r.p.m. for 3 weeks before the medium was supplemented with either 7-chlorotryptamine (2a) or 7-bromotryptamine (2c) (750mM final concentration). Both tryptamine analogue substrates were synthe-sized as previously reported33. After 2 weeks of co-cultivation, hairy roots were extracted as described above in methanol (10 ml g21 fresh hairy root weight). Alkaloid extracts were filtered, concentrated under vacuum and redissolved in 25% acetonitrile/water (0.1% TFA) (1 ml g21 of fresh hairy root weight). For cultures supplemented with 7-chlorotryptamine (2a), the redissolved mix-ture was purified on a 10 3 20 mm Vydec reverse-phase column using a gradient of 25\u201352% acetonitrile/water (0.1% TFA) over 24 min. Alkaloids were monitored at 228 nm and fractions containing the alkaloid analogues of interest, as deter-mined by the characteristic isotopic distribution expected for chlorinated mole-cules (35Cl/37Cl) from LC\u2013MS analysis, were combined and concentrated under vacuum (Supplementary Fig. 27). For cultures supplemented with 7-bromotryptamine (2c), similar procedures were performed to isolate alkaloids from transgenic hairy roots, except that the liquid chromatography method was extended to 26 min. Alkaloids were moni-tored at 228 nm and fractions containing the alkaloid analogues of interest, as determined by LC\u2013MS analysis, were combined and concentrated under vacuum (Supplementary Fig. 28). Isolated alkaloids from both feedings were analysed by LC\u2013MS (same para-meters as above), analytical high-performance liquid chromatography and, where possible, high resolution LC\u2013MS (Supplementary Table 1), ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 29), tandem MS\u2013MS (Supplementary Fig. 30) and 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 1H\u201313C HSQC using a Bruker AVANCE-600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm 1H{13C,31P} cryoprobe (Supplementary Figs 31 and 32). Halogenated alkaloids generally displayed longer retention times than the natural alkaloids. Quantification of chlorinated alkaloid production in transformed hairy roots. 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine (5a) and 12-bromo-19,20-dihydroakuam-micine (5c) standard curves were constructed by quantifying the peak areas of several concentrations (20\u20131,400 nM) of each alkaloid authentic standard using MASSLYNX 4.1. Similarly, 10-chloroajmalicine (6b), 15-chlorotabersonine (7b) and 10-chlorocatharanthine (8b) standard curves were constructed by quantifying the peak areas of several concentrations (20\u20131,400 nM) of each natural (that is, non-chlorinated) alkaloid authentic standard using MASSLYNX 4.1. RESEARCH LETTER Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights Dependence of chlorinated alkaloid production on concentrations of sodium chloride. A selected transformed hairy root line was grown for 2 weeks in low-chloride solid medium (67 mg l21 (NH4)2SO4, 353 mg l 21 Ca(NO3)2?4H2O, 61 mg L21 MgSO4, 1,250 mg l 21 KNO3, half-strength Murashige and Skoog micronutrient salts and full-strength Murashige and Skoog vitamins, 3mM total chloride concentration). Hairy roots were transferred to the same medium sup-plemented with potassium chloride (0\u201320 mM final concentration) and grown for a further 2 weeks. Hairy roots were then processed and alkaloid production was analysed as previously described (Supplementary Figs 17 and 18). Assessment of the stability of chlorinated alkaloid production in subsequent subcultures. Ten root tips from hairy roots transformed with pCAMRebH/RebF and pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm were subcultured every 3 weeks in Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, 6 g l21 agar, pH 5.7). and grown at 26 uC in the dark. Alkaloids were isolated from 21-day-old hairy roots and analysed as described above (Supplementary Figs 11\u201314). Verification of expression of RebH, RebF and PyrH, STRvm enzymes by real-time RT\u2013PCR. Real-time RT\u2013PCR was used to assess the expression levels of RebH and RebF. Expression levels in hairy roots infected with A. rhizogenes lacking the pCAMRebH/RebF construct were compared with expression levels in hairy roots harbouring pCAMRebH/RebF. Messenger RNA from transformed hairy roots was isolated and purified from contaminant DNA using a Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit and Rnase-free DnaseI, respectively. The resulting mRNA was then reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a Qiagen QuantiTect Reverse transcription kit and then subjected to PCR with specific primers (see below), a Qiagen SYBR Green PCR kit and a Biorad DNA Engine Opticon 2 system. The threshold cycle (CT) was determined as the cycle with a signal higher than that of the background plus 10 s.d. Catharanthus roseus 40S ribosomal pro-tein S9 (Rps9), encoded by a house-keeping gene, was used to adjust the amount of the total mRNA in all samples. Real-time RT\u2013PCR was performed in triplicate and the data are pictured as the relative expression levels of rebH and rebF mRNA in transgenic hairy roots as well as hairy roots lacking the pCAMBIA plasmid (Supplementary Fig. 23). PCR primers for real-time RT\u2013PCR of pCAMRebH/RebF transformed hairy roots were designed using the GenScript web tool (http://www.genscript.com/ssl-bin/app/primer), and were as follows (name, sequence): RebH_for, 59-GACGG GCATCTACTTCGTCT-39; RebH_rev, 59-TCGAACATCGTCTCGATCTC-39 (amplicon size, 117); RebF_for, 59-CTGATGAGCCTGTTTCCCA-39; RebF_rev, 59-CGTGACACTGGTCAGGGA-39 (amplicon size, 99); Rbps9_for, 59-TTGAGC CGTATCAGAAATGC-39; Rbps9_rev, 59-CCCTCATCAAGCAGACCATA-39 (amplicon size, 122). Real time RT\u2013PCR was used to assess the expression levels of PyrH, RebF and STRvm. Expression levels in hairy roots infected with A. rhizogenes lacking the pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm construct were compared with expression levels in hairy roots harbouring pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm (Supplementary Fig. 24). Chlorinated alkaloid production in a line lacking STRvm expression is shown in Supplementary Fig. 15. Photographs of the transformed roots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 25. PCR primers for real-time RT\u2013PCR of pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm transformed hairy roots were designed using GenScript web tool, and were as follows (name, sequence): PyrH_for, 59-GCCTGCTCATCAACCAGAC-39; PyrH_rev, 59-CATC GCGGTAGCAGTAGTGT-39 (amplicon size, 137); RebF_for, 59-CTGATGAG CCTGTTTCCCA-39; RebF_rev, 59-CGTGACACTGGTCAGGGA-39 (amplicon size, 99); STRvm_for, 59-TATTATTGAAAGAGCTACATATG-39; STRvm_rev, 59-CTCTGCACTGCCTTTCTTG-39 (amplicon size, 134); Rbps9_for, 59-TTGA GCCGTATCAGAAATGC-39; Rbps9_rev, 59-CCCTCATCAAGCAGACCATA-39 (amplicon size, 122). Quantification of natural alkaloids in wild-type roots. The levels of natural alkaloids in wild type hairy roots was quantified as described in section on quan-tification of chlorinated alkaloid production in transformed hairy roots. The levels of the four most abundant alkaloids found in these hairy roots, ajmalicine (6), tabersonine (7), catharanthine (8), as well as tryptophan (1) and tryptamine (2), were measured (Supplementary Fig. 26). 31.

        "Halogenation, which was once considered a rare occurrence in nat-ure, has now been observed in many natural product biosynthetic pathways1. However, only a small fraction of halogenated com-pounds have been isolated from terrestrial plants2. Given the impact that halogenation can have on the biological activity of natural pro-ducts1, we reasoned that the introduction of halides into medicinal plant metabolism would provide the opportunity to rationally bioengineer a broad variety of novel plant products with altered, and perhaps improved, pharmacological properties. Here we report that chlorination biosynthetic machinery from soil bacteria can be successfully introduced into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). These prokaryotic halogenases function within the context of the plant cell to generate chlorinated tryptophan, which is then shuttled into monoterpene indole alkaloid metabolism to yield chlorinated alkaloids. A new functional group\u2014 a halide\u2014is thereby introduced into the complex metabolism of C. roseus, and is incorporated in a predictable and regioselective manner onto the plant alkaloid products. Medicinal plants, despite their genetic and developmental complexity, therefore seem to be a viable platform for synthetic biology efforts.",
        "Numerous halogenase enzymes from soil bacteria have been iden-tified and characterized extensively1,3\u20135. Two of these flavoenzymes, PyrH6,7 and RebH8\u201311, chlorinate the indole ring of tryptophan in the five and seven positions, respectively. Transferring these enzymes into other natural product pathways would allow site-specific incorpora-tion of halogens onto a range of tryptophan-derived alkaloid pro-ducts12, provided that the downstream enzymes could accommodate the chlorinated tryptophan precursor.",
        "Catharanthus roseus produces a wide variety of monoterpene indole alkaloids13 (Fig. 1a). This metabolic pathway begins with the conver-sion of tryptophan (1) to tryptamine (2) by tryptophan decarboxy-lase14. Tryptamine then condenses with the iridoid terpene",

        "secologanin (3) to form a biosynthetic intermediate strictosidine (4), which is subsequently functionalized in C. roseus to form over 100 alkaloids, including the anticancer agent vinblastine13. Previous work has shown that when C. roseus cell culture is supplemented with a variety of halogenated tryptamines, the corresponding halogenated alkaloid analogues are produced in isolable yields15,16. If prokaryotic halogenases could function in the eukaryotic plant cell, and if trypto-phan decarboxylase could convert halogenated tryptophan into halo-genated tryptamine, then C. roseus would produce chlorinated alkaloids de novo (Fig. 1b). Because RebH and PyrH do not turn over tryptamine, this strategy requires that tryptophan decarboxylase from C. roseus recognize halo-genated tryptophan. We assayed tryptophan decarboxylase from C. roseus in vitro with tryptophan (Km 5 51.7 6 9.2mM (Michaelis constant), kcat 5 5.1 6 0.1 min 21 (turnover number), kcat/Km 5 0.099mM21 min21), 7-chlorotryptophan (1a; Km 5 499 6 74mM, kcat 5 1.6 6 0.04 min 21, kcat/Km 5 0.00327mM 21 min21) and 5-chlor-otryptophan (1b; Km 5 538 6 48mM, kcat 5 2.5 6 0.08 min 21, kcat/ Km 5 0.00455mM 21 min21) (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). The activity of the enzyme suggested that halogenated tryptophan could be decar-boxylated in vivo. When considering how to merge the prokaryotic biosynthetic machinery with the plant alkaloid pathway, we chose to transfer the halogenase enzymes into C. roseus rather than move the plant biosyn-thetic enzymes into a microbial host. Most of the monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthetic genes have not been identified, making hetero-logous expression of this pathway impossible at present. Moreover, we note that reconstitution of plant alkaloid pathways continues to be a challenge17,18. Many alkaloids use complex starting materials (such as secologanin) that are only produced by a few specialized plants, so",

        "reconstitution of plant alkaloid pathways must also include biosyn-thesis of these precursors. For example, ajmalicine (6; Fig. 1a), one of the simplest of the monoterpene indole alkaloids, requires an esti-mated 14 discrete enzymes for biosynthesis from tryptophan and the terpene geraniol13; reconstitution of a pathway of this length is a sig-nificant engineering problem. Therefore, we believe that exploring approaches in the host plant is an important aspect of alkaloid meta-bolic engineering efforts.",
        "To produce 7-chlorotryptophan in planta, we generated an express-ion construct containing codon-optimized complementary DNA encoding the 7-tryptophan chlorinase RebH and its required partner flavin reductase, RebF, in a plant expression vector (pCAMBIA1300), both under the control of constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoters. For production of 5-chlorotryptophan, an expression construct encoding the 5-chlorinating enzyme PyrH, along with RebF as the partner reductase, was generated. No signal sequence was added to the halogenase genes, to ensure that RebH, PyrH and RebF would produce chlorinated tryptophan in the cytosol, where it would most readily encounter the decarboxylase, which is also loca-lized in the cytosol19 (Supplementary Figs 3\u20135).",
        "We used Agrobacterium rhizogenes to generate hairy root culture of C. roseus transformed with the halogenase genes20. One of the early biosynthetic enzymes, strictosidine synthase, cannot turn over 5-chlor-otryptamine21 (2b). Therefore, when transforming C. roseus with pyrH and rebF, we also introduced a mutant of strictosidine synthase (STRvm) that can convert 5-chlorotryptamine to 10-chlorostrictosi-dine16,22 (4b). After a selection process, we cultivated the transformed root culture on standard Gamborg\u2019s B5 plant medium and monitored chlorinated alkaloids using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS). We observed formation of chlorinated tryptophans 1a and 1b and chlorinated alkaloids in both the RebH\u2013RebF and PyrH\u2013RebF\u2013 STRvm hairy root lines (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 6\u201315). These results indicate that RebH, PyrH and the partner reductase function productively in the plant cell environment, demonstrating that the flavin halogenases are highly transportable among kingdoms. Because chlorinated alkaloid production was observed in the trans-formed lines, we conclude that tryptophan decarboxylase can compe-tently turn over halogenated tryptophan substrates in vivo.",
        "Hairy roots transformed with RebH and RebF, which produce 7-chlorotryptophan, yielded a major chlorinated product at m/z 359 (Fig. 2a). An authentic standard of 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuam-micine (5a) co-eluted with this compound. Natural products contain-ing the akuammicine scaffold have a variety of pharmacological activities23\u201325. Although the parent compound, 19,20-dihydroakuam-micine (5) has been isolated in good yields from other plants26, it is not a major alkaloid in C. roseus hairy root culture. However, when wild-type C. roseus cell lines were incubated with 7-chlorotryptamine, 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine was also the major chlorinated product (Supplementary Fig. 16). Therefore, the predominance of 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine in the RebH\u2013RebF hairy root line is probably due to substrate specificity of downstream enzymes for 7-chlorotryptamine. A hairy root line transformed with the 5-chloro-tryptophan enzyme system, PyrH, RebF and STRvm, produced a variety of chlorinated alkaloids (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Two representative chlori-nated alkaloids, 10-chloroajmalicine (6b) and 15-chlorotabersonine (7b), were identified by co-elution with authentic standards21.",
        "Chlorinated alkaloid production seemed to be stable over the course of at least six subcultures. The alkaloid 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroa-kuammicine was produced at 26 6 4mg per gram of fresh root weight of a representative cell line averaged over six subcultures. For compar-ison, wild-type cell lines produced ,25mg per gram of fresh tissue weight of chlorinated alkaloids when the medium was supplemented with 200mM 7-chlorotryptamine (2a). Similarly, 10-chloroajmalicine and 15-chlorotabersonine (7b) were produced at 2.8 6 0.9 and 4.0 6 1.0mg per gram of fresh root weight, respectively, for a repres-entative cell line averaged over four subcultures (Supplementary Figs 12 and 14). Different concentrations of KCl (3mM\u201320 mM) were added to the medium, but increasing amounts of exogenous chloride salt did not significantly affect the yields of chlorinated alkaloids (Supplementary Figs 17 and 18).",
        "Previous reports demonstrated that RebH can use bromide to yield brominated tryptophan8 (1c). To assess the capacity of RebH for bro-mination in vivo, we supplemented a low-chloride cell culture medium with KBr. The in vitro halide specificity of RebH correlated with the products generated in vivo, as we observed the formation of a com-pound that co-eluted with an authentic standard of 12-bromo-19,20-dihydroakuammicine (5c) (21 6 8 and 49 6 20mg per gram of fresh root weight with 10 mM and 20 mM KBr supplementation, respect-ively; Fig. 3). In contrast, supplementation of the medium with KI failed to yield either iodinated tryptophan or iodinated alkaloids. Again, this correlated with in vitro studies showing that RebH does not accept iodide as a substrate8 (Supplementary Figs 19\u201322).",
        "We also measured the transcript levels of the heterologous enzymes by real-time PCR with reverse transcription. The production of halo-genated compounds depended on the expression of both RebF and RebH or PyrH. Notably, when the strictosidine synthase mutant STRvm was not expressed in the PyrH\u2013RebF hairy root lines, we observed accumulation of 5-chlorotryptophan (representative cell line, 9 6 1mg per gram of fresh root weight) and 5-chlorotryptamine (rep-resentative cell line, 20 6 9mg per gram of fresh root weight), but did not observe downstream alkaloids (Supplementary Figs 23 and 24).",
        "Tryptophan does not seem to accumulate in either wild-type or transformed hairy roots. However, accumulation of 7-chlorotrypto-phan (50 6 12mg per gram of fresh root weight for a representative RebH\u2013RebF cell line) and 5-chlorotryptophan (8 6 2mg per gram of fresh root weight for a representative PyrH\u2013RebF\u2013STRvm cell line) was observed, suggesting that decarboxylation of chlorinated trypto-phan is a bottleneck in vivo, a step that could potentially be subjected to future engineering efforts.

        "tryptophan in vitro. The morphologies of the halogen producing lines were thicker and slower growing than those of wild-type lines (Supplementary Fig. 25). Because tryptophan serves as the precursor for other small-molecule metabolites, we speculate that chlorinated tryptophan may be diverted into other pathways such as auxins. Notably, 4-chloro indole acetic acid, which is found in several species of pea, has altered activity relative to the auxin indole acetic acid27,28. Medicinal plants produce a wide range of complex natural products but generate relatively few halogenated compounds; chlorinated or brominated compounds are not found among the approximately 3,000 known monoterpene indole alkaloids produced by plants in the Apocynaceae, Rubiaceae and Loganiaceae families. The halogena-tion of natural products often has profound effects on the bioactivity of the compound, and can serve as a useful handle for further chemical derivatization1,29. Despite the metabolic and developmental complex-ity of plant tissue, transformation of these prokaryotic genes led to the regioselective incorporation of halides into the alkaloid products of the existing plant pathway. Notably, the yield of chlorinated alkaloids in the most productive lines (,26mg per gram of fresh weight of plant tissue) is only 15-fold lower than the yield of total natural alkaloids (compounds 5, 6, 7 and 8) from wild-type tissue (,420mg per gram of fresh weight of plant tissue) (Supplementary Fig. 26). The ease with which we engineered the successful production of chlorinated alka-loids in C. roseus, a plant with limited genetic characterization, indi-cates that medicinal plants can provide a viable platform for synthetic biology.",

Every transgenic hairy root line that survived hygromycin selection medium was evalu-ated for alkaloid production. Transformed hairy roots were grown in Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, 6 g l21 agar, pH 5.7). The total chloride concentration in Gamborg\u2019s B5 formulation was ,1 mM. We ground three-week-old hairy roots with a mortar, pestle and 106-mm acid-washed glass beads in methanol (10 ml g21 fresh weight of hairy roots). The crude natural product mixtures were filtered through 0.2-mm cellulose acetate membrane (VWR) and subsequently subjected to LC\u2013MS analysis. Hairy roots transformed with wild-type A. rhizogenes lacking the plasmid were also evaluated. Brominated alkaloid production in transgenic C. roseus hairy roots. We grew a selected transformed hairy root line for two weeks in low-chloride solid medium (67 mg l21 (NH4)2SO4, 353 mg l 21 Ca(NO3)2?4H2O, 61 mg l 21 MgSO4, 1,250 mg l21 KNO3, half-strength Murashige and Skoog micronutrient salts and full-strength Murashige and Skoog vitamins, 3mM total chloride concentration). Hairy roots were transferred to the same medium supplemented with either pot-assium bromide or potassium iodide (10\u201320 mM final concentration) and culti-vated for an additional two weeks. They were then processed and alkaloid production was analysed as described above (Supplementary Figs 12\u201315). We performed experiments in duplicate.

        "METHODS Heterologous expression and purification of C. roseus tryptophan decarbox-ylase. The tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) gene (accession number M25151.1) was obtained by reverse-transcription PCR (RT\u2013PCR) amplification of mRNA isolated from C. roseus hairy root culture (Invitrogen, Dynabeads mRNA direct kit) with PCR primers that introduce sites for NdeI and XhoI (underlined): 59-AAAAAACATATGGGCAGCATTGATTCAACA-39 and 59-AAAAAACTCGA GTCAAGCTTCTTTGAGCAAATC-39. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega), and then excised and ligated into the NdeI/ XhoI site of the pET28-a plasmid (Novagen). The resulting pET28a\u2013TDC con-struct was subsequently transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS electrocompetent Escherichia coli (Promega). A single E. coli colony harbouring pET28a\u2013TDC was inoculated in 5 ml lysogeny broth medium supplemented with kanamycin (0.05 mg l21) and incubated overnight at 37 uC with shaking at 225 r.p.m. An aliquot of the overnight culture (1 ml) was then used to inoculate 100 ml lysogeny broth medium supplemented with kanamycin (0.05 mg l21) and incubated at 37 uC with shaking at 225 r.p.m. until OD600 0.6 was reached. Cells were induced for overexpression by the addition of isopropyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG; final concentration, 1 mM) and the culture was allowed to continue growth for 16 h at 18 uC. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The hexahistidine-tagged TDC was purified using Ni-NTA Spin Kit (Qiagen) using manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Supplementary Fig. 1). Eluted enzyme was subse-quently buffer-exchanged into phosphate buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and immediately assayed for activity. This enzyme was not stable after extended storage. Determining the steady-state kinetic constants of TDC for tryptophan sub-strate analogues, 5-and 7-chlorotryptophan (1b and 1a). Steady-state kinetic constants of TDC for 5-and 7-chlorotryptophan (1b and 1a) (Amatek) were determined in phosphate buffer (0.1 M NaH2PO4, 3.5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5) containing 1 mM pyridoxal-59-phosphate at 30 uC (0.3-ml reaction volume) with TDC concentrations appropriate for obtaining the initial rate of the reaction (0.6\u20130.9mM). Aliquots (25ml) were quenched in 1 ml methanol, containing yohimbine (500 nM) as an internal standard, at appropriate time points. The samples were centrifuged (13,000 r.p.m. (16,000g), 5 min) to remove particulates and then analysed by LC\u2013MS. Samples were ionized by ESI with a Micromass LCT Premier TOF Mass Spectrometer. The liquid chromatography was performed on an Acquity Ultra Performance BEH C18, 1.7mm, 2.1 3 100 mm column on a gradient of 10\u201390% acetonitrile/water (0.1% formic acid) over 5 min at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min21. The appearance of the corresponding tryptamine analogues (either 5-or 7-chlorotryptamine) was monitored by peak integration and normalized to the internal standard. 5-chlorotryptamine was obtained from a commercial source (Alfa Aesar). 7-chlorotryptamine was synthesized as prev-iously reported3. Eight substrate concentrations (200\u20132,500mM) were tested for 7-chlorotryptophan substrate, and six substrate concentrations (200\u20131,200mM) were tested for 5-chlorotryptophan substrate. Each concentration was assayed three times and the average values are reported with standard deviations. The data were fitted using nonlinear regression to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation using ORIGINPRO 7 (OriginLab). For reference, the kinetic constants for the natural substrate tryptophan (1) were also measured at concentrations ranging from 15 to 350mM (Supplementary Fig. 2).

(i) The CaMV35S:Gus:NosPolyA fragment was obtained by PCR amplification of pCAMBIA1305.1 (Cambia) with forward and reverse PCR primers CaMV35S-NosPolyA that introduce sites for XbaI and KpnI at the 59 end, and PstI and SpeI at the 39 end (underlined): 59-ACTTCTAGAGGTACCGGATCCTCTAGAGTCG ACCTGCAG-39 and 59-ATTCTGCAGACTAGTCCCGATCTAGTAACATAG ATGACACCG-39. (ii) The tryptophan 5-halogenase gene (pyrH; accession number AAU95674) was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from Streptomyces rugosporus NRRL 21084 with forward and reverse PCR primers CrPyrH that introduce sites for XhoI and NcoI at the 59 end, and SpeI and BstEII at the 39 end (underlined): 59-ACTCTCGAGCCATGGATATCCGATCTGTGGTGATCG-39 and 59-ACTACTAGTGGTAACCTCATTGGATGCTGGCGAGGTA-39. (iii) The flavin reductase gene (rebF; accession number BAC15756) was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from Lechevalieria aerocoloni-genes ATCC 39243 with forward and reverse PCR primers CrRebF that introduce sites for XhoI and NcoI at the 59 end, and SpeI and PmlI at the 39 end (underlined): 59-ACTCTCGAGCCATGGATACGATCGAGTTCGACAGAC-39 and 59-ACT ACTAGTCACGTGTCATCCCTCCGGTGTCCACAC-39. (iv) The tryptophan 7-halogenase gene (rebH; accession number BAC15758) was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243 with forward and reverse PCR primers CrRebH that introduce sites for SpeI and NcoI at the 59 end, and SpeI and PmlI at the 39 end (underlined): 59-AAGACTACTAGTCCATGGATTCCGGCAAGATTGAC-39 and 59-ACTACTAGTCACGTGTCAGCGGCCGTGCTGTTGCC-39.",

(v) Codon-optimization for C. roseus was performed to ensure efficient expression of the prokaryotic halogenase and flavin reductase genes in plant cell culture. Using codon usage database software (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/), the fol-lowing codons were identified as occurring at low frequency (triplet, frequency per thousand): GCG, 4.8; CGG, 3.3; ACG, 4.0; TCG, 6.1; CCG, 6.0; and CCC, 6.7. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit to replace rare codons with the most frequently occur-ring codons encoding the corresponding amino acids.

The plant expression construct pCAMRebHRebF was transformed into A. rhizogenes ATCC 15834 by means of electroporation (1-mm cuvette, 1.25 kV). pCAMPyrHRebF and pCAMSTRvm were co-transformed into A. rhizogenes ATCC 15834 via electro-poration (1mm cuvette, 1.25 kV). Transformation of C. roseus seedlings with the generated Agrobacterium strains was performed as previously reported31. Briefly, 180\u2013250 C. roseus seedlings (Vinca Little Bright Eyes, Nature Hills Nursery) were germinated aseptically on Gamborg\u2019s B5 medium (full-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, pH 5.7) and grown in a 16-h light, 8-h dark cycle at 26 uC for 3 weeks.

For the plasmid pCAMRebH/ RebF, the number of transformed hairy roots was 200 and the number of hairy roots after solid medium selection was 31. For the plasmid pCAMPyrH/RebF/ STRvm, the number of transformed hairy roots was 140 and the number of hairy roots after solid medium selection was 57. Verification of transferred DNA integration by genomic DNA analysis. To verify the integration of transferred DNA (T-DNA) into the plant genome, the genomic DNA from transformed hairy roots was isolated (Qiagen DNeasy kit) and then subjected to PCR amplification using T-DNA-specific primers with TDC primers serving as a positive control (see below). Specifically, for the pCAMRebHRebF hairy roots, primers for PCR amplification were designed to amplify the complete TDC gene (TDC_for and TDC_rev), a 660-base-pair (bp) region of the RebH gene (RebH_for and RebH_rev), a 680-bp region of the RebF gene (RebF_for and RebF_rev) and an 800-bp region of the selection marker HPT gene (HPT_for and HPT_rev) (see below). PCR primers for verification of T-DNA integration of transformed hairy roots were as follows (name, sequence): TDC_for, 59-AAAAAACATATGGGCAGC ATTGATTCAACA-39; TDC_rev, 59-AAAAAACTCGAGTCAAGCTTCTTTG AGCAAATC-39; RebH_for, 59-GTCTTCGATGCCGACCTCTTC-39; RebH_rev, 59-GTACATGTCGATCTTCTCCTGC-39; RebF_for, 59-TAGAGGACCTAACAG AAC-39; RebF_rev, 59-CGTGACACTGGTCAGGGA-39; HPT_for, 59-GCCTGA ACTCACCGCGACGTC-39; HPT_rev, 59-CCTCCAGAAGAAGATGTTGGC-39. PCR amplification of genomic DNA from all of the selected transformed lines (pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 4, lanes 1\u20134; pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 5, lanes 5\u20138; pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 6, lanes 9\u201312; pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 10, lanes 13\u2013 16; and pCAMRebH/RebF cell line 11, lanes 17\u201320) was successful for all four sets of primers (Supplementary Fig. 4). PCR amplification of hairy root transformed with A. rhizogenes lacking the pCAMBIA vector (provided by Professor Jacqueline Shanks (Iowa State University) and Professor Carolyn Lee-Parsons (Northeastern University)) genomic DNA was successful only when TDC-specific primers were used (lanes 21\u201324). These results indicated that rebH and rebF were successfully incorporated into the C. roseus genome in all chosen lines. For the pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm hairy roots, primers for PCR amplification were designed to amplify the complete TDC gene (TDC_for and TDC_rev), the complete PyrH gene (PyrH_for and PyrH_rev), a 680-bp region of the RebF gene (RebF_for and RebF_rev), a 440-bp region of the STRvm gene and an 800-bp region of the selection marker HPT gene (HPT_for and HPT_rev) (see below and Supplementary Fig. 5).

PCR amplification of genomic DNA from three of four of the selected trans-formed lines (pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm cell line 1, lanes 1\u20135; pCAMPyrH/RebF/ STRvm cell line 3, lanes 6\u201310, pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm cell line 6, lanes 11\u201315) was successful for all five sets of primers (Supplementary Fig. 5). PCR amplifica-tion of genomic DNA from pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm cell line 7 (lanes 16\u201320) was successful when TDC, PyrH, RebF and HPT primers were used but not when STRvm primers were used. PCR amplification of hairy root transformed with A. rhizogenes lacking the pCAMBIA vector genomic DNA was successful only when TDC specific primers were used (lanes 21\u201325). Evaluation of alkaloid production in transgenic C. roseus hairy roots. Every transgenic hairy root line that survived hygromycin selection medium was eval-uated for alkaloid production. Transformed hairy roots were grown in Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, 6 g l21 agar, pH 5.7). The total chloride concentration in Gamborg\u2019s B5 formula-tion was ,1 mM. Three-week-old hairy roots were ground with a mortar, pestle and 106mm acid-washed glass beads in methanol (10 ml g21 of fresh hairy root weight). The crude natural product mixtures were filtered through 0.2-mm cel-lulose acetate membrane (VWR) and subsequently subjected to LC\u2013MS analysis. Additionally, hairy roots transformed with wild-type A. rhizogenes lacking the plasmid were also evaluated. These crude alkaloid mixtures were diluted 30:830 with methanol for mass spectral analysis. Samples were ionized by ESI with a Micromass LCT Premier TOF Mass Spectrometer. The liquid chromatography was performed on an Acquity Ultra Performance BEH C18, 1.7mm, 2.1 3 100 mm column on a gradient of 10\u201390% acetonitrile/water (0.1% TFA) over 5 min at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min21. The capillary and sample cone voltages were 1,300 and 60 V, respectively. The desolvation and source temperature were 300 and 100 uC, respectively. The cone and desolvation gas flow rates were 60 and 800 l per hour, respectively. Analysis was performed with MASSLYNX 4.1. Accurate mass measurements were obtained in W-mode. The spectra were processed using the MASSLYNX 4.1 mass measure, in which the mass spectrum of peaks of interest was smoothed and centred with TOF mass correction, locking on the reference infusion of reserpine. Data for RebF\u2013RebH lines are shown in extracted LC\u2013MS chromatograms in Supplementary Figs 6\u201310. Feeding of 7-chlorotryptamine (2a) in control C. roseus hairy root cultures transformed with no plasmid. Alkaloid accumulation levels in hairy roots trans-formed with RebH and RebF were compared with alkaloid accumulation levels in control hairy root fed with 7-chlorotryptamine. The control hairy root line was grown for 2 weeks in half-strength Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium. Hairy roots were then transferred to the same medium supplemented with 7-chlorotryptamine (2a; 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 750mM final concentrations) and grown for a further 1 week. Hairy roots were then processed and alkaloid production analysed as described in the previous subsection (Supplementary Fig. 16). Feeding studies were performed in duplicate. Brominated alkaloid production in transgenic C. roseus hairy roots. A selected transformed hairy root line was grown for 2 weeks in low-chloride solid medium (67 mg l21 (NH4)2SO4, 353 mg l 21 Ca(NO3)2?4H2O, 61 mg l 21 MgSO4, 1,250 mg l21 KNO3, half-strength Murashige and Skoog micronutrient salts and full-strength Murashige and Skoog vitamins, 3mM total chloride concentration). Hairy roots were transferred to the same medium supplemented with either pot-assium bromide or potassium iodide (10\u201320 mM final concentration) and culti-vated for an additional 2 weeks. Hairy roots were then processed and alkaloid production analysed as described in the previous subsection but one. Hairy roots transformed with wild-type A. rhizogenes lacking the plasmid were also evaluated (Supplementary Figs 19\u201322). Experiments were performed in duplicate. Purification and isolation of alkaloids from transformed TDC suppressed hairy roots supplemented with 7-chlorotryptamine and 7-bromotryptamine. To obtain chlorinated and brominated alkaloid standards, root tips (10\u201315) from TDC suppressed hairy roots32 were subcultured in six 50 ml Gamborg\u2019s B5 liquid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, pH 5.7) and grown at 26 uC in the dark at 125 r.p.m. for 3 weeks before the medium was supplemented with either 7-chlorotryptamine (2a) or 7-bromotryptamine (2c) (750mM final concentration). Both tryptamine analogue substrates were synthe-sized as previously reported33. After 2 weeks of co-cultivation, hairy roots were extracted as described above in methanol (10 ml g21 fresh hairy root weight). Alkaloid extracts were filtered, concentrated under vacuum and redissolved in 25% acetonitrile/water (0.1% TFA) (1 ml g21 of fresh hairy root weight). For cultures supplemented with 7-chlorotryptamine (2a), the redissolved mix-ture was purified on a 10 3 20 mm Vydec reverse-phase column using a gradient of 25\u201352% acetonitrile/water (0.1% TFA) over 24 min. Alkaloids were monitored at 228 nm and fractions containing the alkaloid analogues of interest, as deter-mined by the characteristic isotopic distribution expected for chlorinated mole-cules (35Cl/37Cl) from LC\u2013MS analysis, were combined and concentrated under vacuum (Supplementary Fig. 27). For cultures supplemented with 7-bromotryptamine (2c), similar procedures were performed to isolate alkaloids from transgenic hairy roots, except that the liquid chromatography method was extended to 26 min. Alkaloids were moni-tored at 228 nm and fractions containing the alkaloid analogues of interest, as determined by LC\u2013MS analysis, were combined and concentrated under vacuum (Supplementary Fig. 28). Isolated alkaloids from both feedings were analysed by LC\u2013MS (same para-meters as above), analytical high-performance liquid chromatography and, where possible, high resolution LC\u2013MS (Supplementary Table 1), ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 29), tandem MS\u2013MS (Supplementary Fig. 30) and 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 1H\u201313C HSQC using a Bruker AVANCE-600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm 1H{13C,31P} cryoprobe (Supplementary Figs 31 and 32). Halogenated alkaloids generally displayed longer retention times than the natural alkaloids. Quantification of chlorinated alkaloid production in transformed hairy roots. 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuammicine (5a) and 12-bromo-19,20-dihydroakuam-micine (5c) standard curves were constructed by quantifying the peak areas of several concentrations (20\u20131,400 nM) of each alkaloid authentic standard using MASSLYNX 4.1. Similarly, 10-chloroajmalicine (6b), 15-chlorotabersonine (7b) and 10-chlorocatharanthine (8b) standard curves were constructed by quantifying the peak areas of several concentrations (20\u20131,400 nM) of each natural (that is, non-chlorinated) alkaloid authentic standard using MASSLYNX 4.1.",

        "Dependence of chlorinated alkaloid production on concentrations of sodium chloride. A selected transformed hairy root line was grown for 2 weeks in low-chloride solid medium (67 mg l21 (NH4)2SO4, 353 mg l 21 Ca(NO3)2?4H2O, 61 mg L21 MgSO4, 1,250 mg l 21 KNO3, half-strength Murashige and Skoog micronutrient salts and full-strength Murashige and Skoog vitamins, 3mM total chloride concentration). Hairy roots were transferred to the same medium sup-plemented with potassium chloride (0\u201320 mM final concentration) and grown for a further 2 weeks. Hairy roots were then processed and alkaloid production was analysed as previously described (Supplementary Figs 17 and 18). Assessment of the stability of chlorinated alkaloid production in subsequent subcultures. Ten root tips from hairy roots transformed with pCAMRebH/RebF and pCAMPyrH/RebF/STRvm were subcultured every 3 weeks in Gamborg\u2019s B5 solid medium (half-strength basal salts, full-strength vitamins, 30 g l21 sucrose, 6 g l21 agar, pH 5.7). and grown at 26 uC in the dark. Alkaloids were isolated from 21-day-old hairy roots and analysed as described above (Supplementary Figs 11\u201314). Verification of expression of RebH, RebF and PyrH, STRvm enzymes by real-time RT\u2013PCR. Real-time RT\u2013PCR was used to assess the expression levels of RebH and RebF. Expression levels in hairy roots infected with A. rhizogenes lacking the pCAMRebH/RebF construct were compared with expression levels in hairy roots harbouring pCAMRebH/RebF. Messenger RNA from transformed hairy roots was isolated and purified from contaminant DNA using a Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit and Rnase-free DnaseI, respectively. The resulting mRNA was then reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a Qiagen QuantiTect Reverse transcription kit and then subjected to PCR with specific primers (see below), a Qiagen SYBR Green PCR kit and a Biorad DNA Engine Opticon 2 system. The threshold cycle (CT) was determined as the cycle with a signal higher than that of the background plus 10 s.d. Catharanthus roseus 40S ribosomal pro-tein S9 (Rps9), encoded by a house-keeping gene, was used to adjust the amount of the total mRNA in all samples. Real-time RT\u2013PCR was performed in triplicate and the data are pictured as the relative expression levels of rebH and rebF mRNA in transgenic hairy roots as well as hairy roots lacking the pCAMBIA plasmid (Supplementary Fig. 23).",
