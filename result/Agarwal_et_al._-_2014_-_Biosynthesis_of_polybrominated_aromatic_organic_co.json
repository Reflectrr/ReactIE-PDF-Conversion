University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, USAAbstract Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polybrominated bipyrroles are natural products thatbioaccumulate in the marine food chain. PBDEs have attracted widespread attention due to theirpersistence in the environment and potential toxicity to humans. However, the natural origins ofPBDE biosynthesis are not known. Here we report marine bacteria as producers of PBDEs andestablish a genetic and molecular foundation for their production that unifies paradigms for theelaboration of bromophenols and bromopyrroles abundant in marine biota. We providebiochemical evidence of marine brominase enzymes revealing decarboxylative-halogenationenzymology previously unknown among halogenating enzymes. Biosynthetic motifs discovered inour study were used to mine sequence databases to discover unrealized marine bacterial producersof organobromine compounds.Halogenation, particularly bromination, is a diagnostic feature of marine natural products.While bromide is present in only trace amounts terrestrially, its greater natural abundance inseawater provides a substrate reservoir for halogenating enzymes evolved to selectively*Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to B.S.M. bsmoore@ucsd.edu.5These authors contributed equally to this work\u2020Present address: JNC Corporation, Yokohama Research Center, Japan.\u00a7Present address: Salk Institute for Biological Studies, USA.Author ContributionsV.A., A.A.E., E.E.A. and B.S.M. designed research, V.A., A.A.E. and K.Y. performed genetic experiments, V.A., A.A.E. and R.D.Kperformed in vitro experiments, M.S. and E.E.A. generated sequencing data, D.P. contributed new analytical reagents, V.A., A.A.E.,E.E.A. and B.S.M. analyzed data and wrote the manuscript.Competing financial interestsThe authors declare no competing financial interests.Additional informationSupplementary information is available in the online version of the paper.

Marine organisms, including bacteria,algae and invertebrates, are prolific sources of organobromine compounds that number over2200 reported molecules with a wide range of biological properties1\u20132. These brominatednatural products range from simple volatile polybromoalkanes3 to highly complexalkaloids4. Yet, our understanding of the biosynthesis of brominated natural products haslagged far behind their discovery largely because few biosynthetic gene loci have beenidentified and characterized. Herein we report a pervasive marine bacterial pathway topolybrominated aromatic compounds that accounts for a diverse suite of commonpolybrominated pyrrole and phenol-based natural products.In their hydroxylated (OH-BDE) and methoxylated (MeO-BDE) forms, PBDEs areabundant across all trophic levels of marine life ranging from marine plants5, algae6\u20138 andinvertebrates9\u201312, to marine mammals at the apex of the food chain13\u201315. OH-BDEs andMeO-BDEs detected in marine biota were once thought to be derived from chemicaltransformation of anthropogenically produced polybrominated flame retardants chemicals ofsimilar structure16. However, derivatives such as 2\u2019-MeO-BDE-47, a metabolite widelydetected in the marine metabolome (Fig. 1a), were shown through \u039414C measurements to beof natural origin15. Despite the mounting evidence for the biosynthesis of OH-BDEs in thenatural metabolome, no natural producer of these potential toxins that target mammaliannuclear hormone mediated signaling pathways17 has been confirmed.An abundance of PBDEs at all trophic levels of marine Eukarya suggests lower trophic levelsources for their genesis. This hypothesis is supported by the production of chemicallysimilar polybrominated molecules, such as 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetrabromo-2,2\u2019-biphenyldiol (1)18,hexabromo-2,2\u2019-bipyrrole (2)19, and the hybrid bromophenol-bromopyrrolepentabromopseudilin (3)19\u201320 (Fig. 1a), by Pseudoalteromonas spp., marine \u03b3-proteobacteriaoften associated with eukaryotic hosts21. While 1\u20132 are not industrially synthesized, theirmethylated analogs are extensively detected in marine mammals14,22 (Fig. 1a). Notably, incontrast to the microbial biosynthesis of polybrominated biphenyls and bipyrroles,production of PBDEs has not been confirmed from marine bacterial sources.Herein we report the discovery of a conserved biosynthetic gene cluster in marine bacteriaresponsible for the synthesis of widespread polybrominated aromatic compounds anddescribe two flavin-dependent brominases involved in the synthesis of universalpolybromophenol-and polybromopyrrole-based metabolites. For the first time, our findingsestablish marine bacteria as sources of OH-BDEs. Moreover, we provide the first report andbiochemical characterization of a flavin-dependent decarboxylative-brominase enzymeemploying an inferred enzyme architecture not previously realized among halogenases.RESULTS A genetic basis for bromination in marine bacteriaIn our search for marine prokaryotic sources of polybrominated molecules, we focused onthe cosmopolitan marine genus Pseudoalteromonas spp. previously shown to produce 1\u20133.Specifically, we queried the small molecule natural products synthesized by coral-associatedP. luteoviolacea 2ta16 isolated in the Florida Keys23, and by planktonic P. phenolica O-Agarwal et al.Page 2Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 01.N IH -P A  Author Manuscript N IH -P A  Author Manuscript N IH -P A  Author Manuscript BC30 isolated off the coast of Japan18. We analyzed organic extracts of liquid cultures ofthese marine bacteria grown in the presence of bromide by high performance liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Among numerouspolybrominated molecules present in culture extract of both bacteria, we confirmed theproduction of 1\u20133 by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy of isolated compounds(Figs. 1b, Supplementary Results, Supplementary Figs. 1\u20132 and Supplementary Table 1).Additionally, we confirmed the production of a large series of bromophenol andbromopyrrole monomeric molecules, including 2,4-dibromophenol (4), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (5), 2,3,4-tribromopyrrole (6) and 2,3,4,5-tetrabromopyrrole (7) on the basisof their MS spectra and comparison to synthetic standards (Supplementary Fig. 2 andSupplementary Table 1).Having established experimentally tractable marine bacterial sources for the production of1\u20137, we next sought to determine the genetic basis for the production of thesepolybrominated small molecule marine natural products. Towards this aim, we sequencedthe genomes of P. luteoviolacea 2ta16 and P. phenolica O-BC30, resulting in draft 6.36 Mband 4.76 Mb genomes, respectively. We hypothesized that the bromopyrroles, and byextension the bromopyrrole moieties of heterodimeric molecules such as 3, are derived in amanner analogous to the biosynthesis of the dichlorinated pyrrole moiety of the antifungalnatural product pyoluteorin24, consistent with prior isotope feeding studies tracing thesource of the pyrrole moiety of 3 to L-proline25 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Hence, we queriedthe genomes of P. luteoviolacea 2ta16 and P. phenolica O-BC30 for the prolinedehydrogenase (PltE) and the pyrrole halogenase (PltA) enzymes from pyoluteorinbiosynthesis. This analysis successfully led to the identification of the brominated marinepyrroles/phenols (bmp) biosynthetic gene locus in both bacteria. Homologs of pltE and pltA(bmp3 and bmp2, respectively, Fig. 1c) were found clustered together with genes putativelyencoding an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-thioesterase (TE) di-domain protein (bmp1), prolineadenyltransferase (bmp4), flavin-dependent oxygenase (bmp5), chorismate lyase (bmp6),cytochrome P450 (CYP450, bmp7), ferredoxin (bmp9) and ferredoxin reductase (bmp10),and a carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase homolog (bmp8). Primary sequence similarityof Bmp ORFs to pyoluteorin biosynthetic enzymes is provided in Supplementary Table 2.In order to confirm the contribution of the bmp gene cluster to the biosynthesis of 1\u20137, weconstructed an expression vector and heterologously expressed P. luteoviolacea 2ta16bmp1\u20138 genes in Escherichia coli (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 3 and5). In the presence of bromide, we observed the heterologous production of 1\u20137 (Fig. 2a,b).Note that the complexity of the culture extract precludes a concomitant visual representationof all polybrominated molecules within a single TIC. We next explored the individualfunctions of the bmp1\u20138 genes by expressing the bmp cluster with individual gene deletions(Supplementary Table 5). As postulated by homology to the pyoluteorin pyrrole dichlorinaseenzyme PltA and consistent with its assignment as a pyrrole brominase, deletion of bmp2abolished the production of bromopyrroles 2, 3, 6 and 7 (Fig. 2a). On the other hand,deletion of bmp5 eliminated 1, 3, and all other bromophenol-containing species, leading tothe proposed role of Bmp5 as a phenol brominase. We further identified bmp7 as a couplingenzyme as its deletion led to the abolishment of all dimers 1\u20133, while monomers 4\u20136 couldAgarwal et al.Page 3Nat Chem Biol.

These experimentsestablished the first genetic link to the production of polybrominated aromatic molecules innature. We next analyzed genomic datasets for the presence of orphan gene loci related to the bmpgene cluster. Indeed, we identified a highly conserved gene cluster in the melanogenicmarine bacterium Marinomonas mediterranea MMB-126, with an insertion of a putativepermease between bmp3 and bmp4 (Fig. 1c). As expected, we confirmed the production ofbrominated molecules 1\u20133 by M. mediterranea MMB-1 (Supplementary Fig. 1), providingthe first report of halogenated natural products from this genus that commonly associateswith sea grass. Indeed, the methylated variant of 7 (2,3,4,5-tetrabromo-1-methylpyrrole) andMeO-BDEs such as 2\u2019-MeO-BDE-68 (vide infra) have been detected in the sea grassHalophila ovalis5 and obligate marine herbivores such as dugongs13. We also identified atruncated gene cluster in the Lissoclinum patella tunicate metagenomic dataset for themarine cyanobacterial symbiont Prochloron didemni P-2 Fiji27 (Fig. 1c). Additionally, wefound a highly similar gene locus in the sulfur-oxidizing \u03b3-proteobacterium Thioalkalivibriothiocyanoxidans ARh 428, notably with the omission of CYP450 bmp7 and CYP450electron transfer partners bmp9 and bmp10 (Fig. 1c).Brominase Bmp2 catalyzes pyrrole tribrominationWe next sought biochemical confirmation for individual enzymatic transformations in theBmp pathway, suggested by proline-based halopyrrole biosynthetic logic and gene deletionexperiments. As characterized for the biosynthesis of pyrrole moieties in numerous alkaloidnatural products29, the proline adenyltransferase Bmp4, together with flavin-dependentdehydrogenase Bmp3 catalyzed the near stoichiometric conversion of holo-Bmp1 topyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 (Supplementary Figs. 6\u20138, see Supplementary Note 1 for detailedanalytical protocols). Enzymatic conversion was abolished in the absence of eitheradenosine triphosphate (ATP) or L-proline, while reduced conversion was observed in theabsence of Mg2+. These observations were consistent with the proposed reaction scheme foradenyltransferases proceeding via an adenylated amino acid intermediate that issubsequently transferred to the phosphopantetheine sulfhydryl of the ACP with theconcomitant release of adenosine monophosphate (AMP).Bmp2 is homologous to canonical flavin-dependent halogenases that utilize ACP-tetheredsubstrates30 (Supplementary Fig. 30). Flavin-dependent halogenase enzymes require anexogenous supply of reduced flavin co-factor (FADH2), typically provided in situ by aflavin reductase that catalyzes the reduction of the flavin cofactor with the concomitantoxidation of NAD(P)H24,31. In the presence of E. coli flavin reductase SsuE32, NADPH andbromide, Bmp2 catalyzed the bromination of pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1(ACP) to mono-, di-andtribromopyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 (Fig. 3). This result establishes the in vitro reconstitution of thefirst flavin-dependent halogenase with physiological bromination activity involved in naturalproduct biosynthesis. Assignment of Bmp2 as a brominase is further supported by theobservation that no incorporation of chloride was detected33. While numerous bromopyrrolecontaining marine natural products have been identified4,34, 2\u20133 bear a distinct chemicalsignature in that all three available positions on the pyrrole ring are brominated, rather thanAgarwal et al.Page 4Nat Chem Biol.

While the esterase activity ofBmp1 TE domain could indeed be confirmed by the hydrolysis of the model esterasesubstrate p-nitrophenylacetate (Supplementary Fig. 10), biochemical investigations into theformation of 6 by Bmp8 were precluded by our inability to generate soluble recombinantBmp8 protein. However, the expression of bmp1\u20137 in E. coli excluding bmp8 resulted inaltered levels of bromopyrroles, thus supporting a role of Bmp8 in bromopyrrolebiosynthesis (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 11).Bmp5, a decarboxylating phenol brominaseIn contrast to assembly of bromopyrroles, the biosynthetic logic for the assembly ofbromophenols, and thereafter of PBDEs and polybrominated biphenyls could not be readilyanticipated. Previous isotope feeding experiments and the presence of chorismate lyase(Bmp6) in the gene cluster suggested 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) as the precursor forthe bromophenol moiety of 335. While the bmp5 deletion experiments postulated its role asthe phenol brominase, lack of sequence similarity of the flavoenzyme Bmp5 to canonicalflavin-dependent halogenases, which includes Bmp2, led to uncertainty in this assignment.Moreover, incorporation of 4-HBA into bromophenols necessitates decarboxylation, atransformation not previously associated with flavin-dependent halogenases. Hence, weundertook a detailed in vitro characterization of the activity of Bmp5. Upon incubation of 4-HBA with recombinant Bmp5 in the presence of bromide, NADPH, and FAD, we observeda time-dependent formation of one major product via a stable intermediate (Fig. 4a andSupplementary Fig. 16). The identity of the intermediate as 3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid(8) and of the product as 4 was confirmed by mass spectrometry and retention timecomparison to authentic synthetic standards (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 17). Bmp5could utilize 8 as a substrate for the synthesis of 4, further establishing 8 as the physiologicalintermediate for the reaction (Fig. 4b). Bmp5 also generated 5 when expressed in E. coli inthe presence of bromide (Supplementary Fig. 17). While production of 5 could not bedetected in vitro, this observation is consistent with the acceptance of 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (9) as a poor substrate by Bmp5 as compared to 4-HBA and 8 (Fig.4b). Bmp5 activity was abolished in the absence of either bromide or NADPH, while apartial reduction in activity was observed upon omission of FAD, consistent with the partialoccupancy of FAD in Bmp5 as purified (Supplementary Fig. 18). Consistent with priorcharacterization of halide specificity of aromatic halogenases33, Bmp5 could utilize iodidein vivo leading to the formation of iodophenols while no chloride incorporation wasobserved (Supplementary Fig. 28).In contrast to the flavin-dependent halogenases described to date, Bmp5 did not require theaddition of a flavin reductase to regenerate FADH2 in situ. This finding is consistent withsequence homology of Bmp5 to single-component flavin-dependent oxygenases(Supplementary Fig. 30). Consistent with the formation of electrophilic peroxoAgarwal et al.Page 5Nat Chem Biol.

To the best of our knowledge, Bmp5 represents the first example of adecarboxylating flavin-dependent halogenase. Stability of benzoic acids distinguishes theBmp5 decarboxylation activity from the extensively sampled marine haloperoxidases37 thatparticipate in the decarboxylative degradation of labile halogenated derivatives of 3-oxocarboxylic acids and acyl homoserine lactones38\u201339.Bmp7 catalyzed coupling of bromophenols and bromopyrrolesWe next investigated whether the bromophenol products of Bmp5 could be accepted assubstrates by CYP450 Bmp7. In the presence of ferredoxin (Bmp9), ferredoxin reductase(Bmp10), and NADH, Bmp7 catalyzed the coupling of 4 to at least six distinct products thatcould be identified by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 5a). Characterization of Bmp7 products provided byMS/MS, NMR and comparison to authentic standards is detailed in the Supplementary Note2. We confirmed polybrominated biphenyls previously isolated from Pseudoalteromonasspp., 118 and 3,5,5\u2019-tribromo-2,2\u2019-biphenyldiol (10)40 as Bmp7 products (Fig. 5 andSupplementary Figs. 19\u201320). Additionally, a tribromo-biphenyldiol isomer of 10 (denotedby * in Fig. 5a) was detected as a Bmp7 product, but could not be isolated in sufficientquantities for comprehensive structure elucidation.Guided by differential MS/MS fragmentation of polybrominated biphenyls and OH-BDEs41,we further characterized three OH-BDE products, namely 2,6-dibromo-4-(2,4-dibromophenoxy)phenol (11), 2-bromo-4-(2,4-dibromophenoxy)phenol (12), and 4,6-dibromo-2-(2,4-dibromophenoxy)phenol (2\u2019-OH-BDE68, 13) (Supplementary Note 2, Fig. 5and Supplementary Figs. 20\u201322). The OH-BDE products possess two distinct chemicalsignatures, namely, para-(11\u201312) and ortho-coupling (13) with respect to the hydroxylgroup (Fig. 5b). Guided by our in vitro identification of OH-BDEs, we analyzed organicextracts of P. luteoviolacea 2ta16, as well as E. coli expressing bmp1\u20138, and confirmed thein vivo production of 11\u201312 (denoted by \u25cf and \u25b2, respectively, in Fig. 1b and Fig. 2a). Thisobservation provides the first confirmation for marine bacterial biosynthesis of OH-BDEs.11 and 13 are isomeric with 1, and have very similar retention time to each other. Moreover,in contrast to the diagnostic MS2 patterns for polybrominated biphenyls and para-OH-BDEs(see Supplemental Note 2), structural characterization of 13 relied on comparison to anauthentic synthetic standard (Supplementary Fig. 22). These findings highlight some of thetechnical challenges inherent with the characterization of isomeric polybrominated biphenyland OH-BDE products from whole-cell culture extracts.Bmp7 could also dimerize two molecules of 5, albeit with reduced catalytic efficiency, togenerate the OH-BDE product 2,6-dibromo-4-(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)phenol (14) (Fig. 5band Supplementary Figs. 23\u201324). Bmp7 converted chlorinated phenolic substrates as well,catalyzing the dimerization of 2,4-dichlorophenol to three isomeric products, correspondingto chlorinated counterparts to the polybrominated products 1, 11 and 13 generated with 4(Supplementary Fig. 25). The mass spectrometry-based prediction of the polychlorinatedproducts is described in detail in Supplementary Note 2.Agarwal et al.Page 6Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 01.N IH -P A  Author Manuscript N IH -P A  Author Manuscript N IH -P A  Author Manuscript Proceeding based on the biosynthetic logic for the hydrolytic offloading of tribromopyrrolecarboxylic acid by Bmp1 TE domain and its decarboxylation by Bmp8, we propose 6 as thephysiological substrate for Bmp7, which was supported by a typical substrate-induced UV-Vis absorbance shift (Supplementary Fig. 12). In vitro activity assays of Bmp7 in thepresence of redox partners Bmp9\u201310 and NADH with 6 as a substrate generated 2 and 7 asmajor products (Supplementary Figs. 13\u201315). The identity of reaction products wasconfirmed by comparison to authentic standards. A final demonstration for the biosyntheticversatility for Bmp7 was provided by an in vitro reaction involving the heterodimerizationof 4 and 6. We confirmed the enzymatic synthesis of 3 and 2,3,5,7-tetrabromobenzofuro[3,2-b]pyrrole (15)40 by comparison to authentic standards isolatedfrom P. luteoviolacea 2ta16 (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Figs. 26\u201327). Additionally, wedetected an isomer of 3 as a minor product generated by Bmp7 during the in vitro couplingof 4 and 6, which could also be detected in the culture extracts of the three producer strains.Though a comprehensive structural characterization by NMR spectroscopy could not berealized, a characteristic hydroxytribromopyrrole MS/MS product ion suggests apolybrominated phenol-pyrrole ether, a class of marine natural product not previouslydescribed (Supplementary Fig. 29).DISCUSSION While several Bmp pathway products identified in this study were previously isolated frommarine bacteria (1\u2013318\u201320, 719, 10 and 1540) with 3 being characterized nearly half a centuryago, the genetic and molecular bases of their biosyntheses have remained elusive until now.In this study, we identified a conserved gene locus in Gram-negative marine bacteriaencoding the biosynthesis of at least fifteen polybrominated aromatic marine naturalproducts containing ubiquitous bromopyrrole and bromophenol building blocks. A nearcomplete in vitro reconstitution of all enzymatic steps within the Bmp pathway provides thebasis for a bi-modular biosynthetic scheme as shown in Fig. 6a.The bromopyrrole and bromophenol biosynthetic modules function independently and areunited through the action of CYP450 Bmp7. CYP450-catalyzed phenol coupling reactionshave extensive biochemical precedents, and the formation of polybrominated biphenyls 1and 10, and OH-BDEs 11\u201314 are expected to follow accepted bi-radical mechanisms (Fig.6b). A similar mechanism can be envisaged for coupling of bromopyrroles, consistent withCYP450-catalyzed coupling in indolocarbazole antibiotics42. The modularity of the Bmppathway is reflected in the preservation of only the bromopyrrole biosynthetic module in themarine symbiotic cyanobacterium P. didemni P2-Fiji27 (Fig. 1c). As the bromophenolmodule is absent, it is likely that P. didemni P2-Fiji produces only halogenated pyrroles.Furthermore, a homologous gene locus identified in T. thiocyanoxidans ARh 4 lacks a genecoding for a coupling CYP450 (Fig. 1c). It is conceivable that an even wider applicability ofthe chemical logic described here for the biosynthesis of marine bromophenols andbromopyrroles is limited only by the availability of genomic data.The discovery of flavoenzyme Bmp5 as a phenol brominase was unexpected. Bmp5 ishomologous to flavin-dependent oxygenases43, rather than flavindependent halogenases.Primary sequence motifs for binding both the flavin cofactor, as well as the nicotinamideAgarwal et al.Page 7Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 01.N IH -P A  Author Manuscript N IH -P A  Author Manuscript N IH -P A  Author Manuscript electron donor can be readily discerned within the primary sequence of Bmp5(Supplementary Fig. 30). Indeed, bmp5 homologs in the biosynthetic gene clusters identifiedin M. mediterranea MMB-1 and T. thiocyanoxidans ARh 4 are annotated as flavin-dependent oxygenases (Fig. 1c). While decarboxylation was until now an unrealized activitywithin the catalytic repertoire of flavin-dependent halogenases, ortho-hydroxylation of 4-HBA44 as well as para-decarboxylative-hydroxylation of 4-HBA45 have been reported forflavin-dependent oxygenases, leading to a proposal for a two-step reaction schemeemployed by Bmp5 (Fig. 4c). The collective action of an electron-donating phenol hydroxyland electron-withdrawing carboxyl group would first direct electrophilic bromoniumaddition at the ortho position, and subsequent proton abstraction by a catalytic base wouldresult in the formation of 8. This intermediate would then undergo a second bromoniumaddition para to the hydroxyl, followed by decarboxylation to generate 4. The Bmp5reaction is regiospecific, in that ortho bromination is the first half reaction, followed bydecarboxylative-bromination at the para position. This assertion for the strictly directed two-step Bmp5 reaction scheme is supported by 4-bromophenol not being detected as anintermediate, or as a product of the Bmp5 reaction (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the Bmp5 activesite likely sterically occludes bromonium addition at one of the ortho positions of the arylring, thus biasing the second half reaction towards decarboxylative-bromination at the paraposition, rather than a second ortho-bromination to yield 9 as a second intermediate. Thispostulate is supported by the observation that under identical experimental conditions, ratesof decrease of 4-HBA and 8 in an in vitro reaction with Bmp5 are nearly identical, while 9 isa poor substrate for Bmp5 (Fig. 4b). Consequently, 5 is a minor product generated by Bmp5that could not be detected in vitro, but is only detected to be produced in vivo when Bmp5 isheterologously expressed in E. coli in presence of bromide in the culture media(Supplementary Fig. 17). Additionally, Bmp5 could utilize iodide, but not chloride in vivo(Supplementary Fig. 28).It is intriguing that neither bromophenol monomers nor OH-BDEs had previously beenisolated from marine bacterial sources. Bromophenols and OH-BDEs identified in this study(and their methylated derivatives) have instead been extensively detected in marineeukaryotes, ranging from autotrophs and invertebrates, to apex predators5\u201315,46. Whilesponge-associated symbiotic marine cyanobacteria were hinted as producers of OH-BDEs10,a definite genetic basis for OH-BDE biosynthesis had not been established. Furthermore, inthe absence of definitive genetic evidence for algal biosynthesis of OH-BDEs, a contributionof associated bacteria towards the production of OH-BDEs sourced from marine algaecannot be discounted8,12. It is thus noteworthy that all three marine bacteria harboring theBmp pathway as identified in this study also belong to genera commonly associated withmarine eukaryotes. Identification of the bmp gene locus should henceforth aid thecomputational mining of marine metagenomic datasets for the identification of bacterial, aswell as potential eukaryotic OH-BDE producers utilizing similar motifs. Together with 1(Fig. 1a), the methoxylated derivative for 13 (2\u2019-MeO-BDE-68, Fig. 5b), is extensivelydetected in marine mammals and even humans14\u201315, suggesting that bromophenols and OH-BDEs identified in this study bioaccumulate in the marine food web and are transferred tohumans via trophic connections. Furthermore, methylation of OH-BDEs, and by extensionof polybrominated biphenyls and bipyrroles (Fig. 1a), appears to be a facile biochemicalAgarwal et al.Page 8Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 01.N IH -P A  Author Manuscript N IH -P A  Author Manuscript N IH -P A  Author Manuscript transformation consistent with a positive correlation between the existence of OH-BDEs andMeO-BDEs in marine environmental matrices16,47.OH-BDEs, such as those characterized in this study, commonly feature two distinctchemical signatures in which the hydroxyl group is positioned either ortho or para to theether linkage. Of the two regioisomers, para-OH-BDEs are potent inhibitors of thyroidhormone signaling48, with 14 having a higher affinity for binding to the thyroid hormonetransport protein than its physiological substrates49. Hence, the detection of para-OH-BDEs,such as 11\u201312, and specifically 14, puts into perspective the toxic potential of themetabolites generated by the Bmp pathway. As the synthesis of biphenyls and diphenylethers could also be confirmed for Bmp7 using polychlorinated and polyiodinated phenolicsubstrates (Supplementary Figs. 25, 28), other naturally occurring polyhalogenated arylcompounds may also be derived from analogous enzymatic pathways with differing halogenspecificities of the halogenases. As the industrial production of polybrominated flameretardant chemicals continues to be phased out in recognition of their persistence andtoxicity, we anticipate that naturally produced marine bacterial PBDEs will take a centerstage in informing our small molecule-mediated interactions with the environment.ONLINE METHODSSources of polyhalogenated molecules described in this studyAnalytical standards of compounds 1 and 10 were obtained by purifying an impure standardof 1 obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (S842753) as described in detail in Supplementary Fig.19.

Fresh 5 mL cultures (100 \u00b5g/mL carbenicillin, 50 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin, 0.01%w/v FeSO4, 1 g/L 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 1 g/L L-proline, 1 g/L KBr) were inoculated witha 2% inoculum of pre-culture at 30 \u00b0C for 3 h with shaking, induced with 2.5 \u00b5L of 100 mMIPTG, and incubated for an additional 16 h at 30 \u00b0C with shaking. E. coli expressing bmp1\u20138 and ppt grown in LB media not supplemented with KBr was used as a negative control.Sample preparation and LC-MS/MS analysis was performed as previously described forwild type bacterial strains.Cloning, protein expression and purificationBased on primary sequence, Bmp1(ACP) domain was mapped to residues 1 through 77.ORFs were amplified by PCR, and cloned using appropriate restriction sites into pET28a(+)expression vector, with the exception of Sfp, which was cloned into a pET24a(+) vector, andintroduced into competent E. coli BL21Gold(DE3) for recombinant protein expression.Terrific broth cultures were grown in the presence of 50 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin. Cultures forBmp2 and Bmp9 were spiked with 10 mg of riboflavin (Fisher Scientific, AC13235-0250),Bmp10 with 50 mg Fe(II)SO4, and Bmp7 with 0.15 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich A3785-1G). Cultures were grown at 30 \u00b0C till the optical density of 0.5 wasobtained, and then shifted to 16 \u00b0C. After 1 h, protein expression was induced by theaddition of 0.15 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Further growth wasallowed at 16 \u00b0C for 24 h. For Bmp7, the culture was spiked with an additional 0.15 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid after 24 h, and growth allowed for an additional 24 h.Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 500mM NaCl 10% glycerol buffer, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at16,000g for 45 min, and the supernatant applied to 5 mL bed volume Ni-NTA columnequilibrated in the harvest buffer. The column was extensively washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 1 M NaCl 30 mM imidazole buffer, and the protein eluted with a lineargradient to 250 mM imidazole. With the exception of Bmp10 and SsuE, pure proteinfractions were pooled, and extensively dialyzed in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.9) 50 mM NaCl bufferat 4 \u00b0C in the presence of 1 unit/mg thrombin protease (MP Biomedicals, 154163). Nothrombin was added to Sfp and Bmp1(ACP).After dialysis, all proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using aQ-FF column. The proteins were then desalted to 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.6)10% glycerol buffer using PD-10 columns, and stored at -80 \u00b0C in small aliquots. N-His6-Bmp10 was directly desalted to 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.6) 10% glycerol bufferusing PD-10 column after affinity chromatography and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Thrombin was thenadded.

Nair and expressed and purified in an identical manner.Coexpression of Bmp1(ACP) with Bmp3As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, M. mediterranea MMB-1 bmp1 was ligated intoRSFDuet-1 vector MCS-1 digested with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes. Thisconstruct encodes a N-His6 tag fused to Bmp1. In MCS-2 of the same vector, the ORFcorresponding to an ACP synthase (GenBank:  NC_015276.1) was inserted using NdeI andXhoI restriction sites. RSFDuet-1 vector utilizes a kanamycin resistance marker. M.mediterranea MMB-1 bmp3 was ligated into CDFDuet-1 vector MCS-2 digested with NdeIand XhoI restriction enzymes. CDFDuet-1 vector utilizes a streptomycin resistance marker.Also shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 is the di-domain architecture of Bmp1. As identified bysequence homology, the N-terminal 77 residues constitute the ACP domain, with Ser35being the site for phosphopantetheinylation. Residues 78 to the C terminus constitute the TEdomain, with Ser202 being the catalytic nucleophilic residue of a typical serine protease/esterase Ser-His-Asp/Glu triad. To generate Bmp1(ACP), the codon corresponding toresidue 78 of bmp1 was mutated to a stop codon by site directed mutagenesis. The twovectors were then co-transformed into E. coli BL21Gold(DE3) competent cells. Proteinexpression cultures were spiked with 0.1 mM D-pantothenic acid (Sigma-Aldrich,P2250-5G), and 10 mg riboflavin. Bmp1(ACP) was then purified by affinitychromatography.

The reaction was quenched by the addition of saturated brine andextracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over MgSO4,concentrated in vacuo and purified on a silica gel column using hexanes/ethyl acetate 40:1as solvent. S-phenyl-pyrrole-2-carbothioate (10 mg, 0.49 mmol, 27%) was obtained. S-phenyl-pyrrole-2-carbothioate (4 mg, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in 300 \u00b5L sodiumphosphate-buffer (50 mM, pH 8.5) and 200 \u00b5L THF. To this solution coenzyme A sodium-salt (Sigma-Aldrich, C4780-100MG, 14 mg, 0.018 mmol) was added and the reactionmixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The product was purified by semi-preparative HPLC on a reversed phase C18 column (Phenomenex Luna 5 \u00b5m, 250 mm x 10mm, 100 \u00c5) using a gradient of 5\u2013100% MeCN+0.1% TFA in H2O+0.1% TFA over 30 min.Fractions containing the product were lyophilized and pure S-coenzyme A-pyrrole-2-carbothioate (15) (1.2 mg, 0.0014 mmol, 7%) was obtained. 1H NMR spectra for 16 isreported in Supplementary Fig. 9. 16: 1H NMR (600 MHz, D2O) \u03b4 8.67 \u2013 8.63 (m, 1H), 8.33(s, 1H), 7.16 \u2013 7.12 (m, 1H), 7.15 (d, J = 7 Hz, 1H), 6.29 \u2013 6.26 (m, 1H), 6.18 (d, J = 10 Hz1H), 4.63-4.62 (m, 1H), 4.30 \u2013 4.23 (m, 2H), 4.04 (s, 1H), 3.88 \u2013 3.84 (m, 2H), 3.61 \u2013 3.57(m, 2H), 3.48 \u2013 3.46 (m, 1H), 3.45-3.43 (m 1H) 3.41 (m, 1H), 3.23 (s, 1H), 3.12 (m, 1H),2.44 (t, J = 10 Hz, 2H), 0.94 (s, 3H), 0.80 (s, 3H).Agarwal et al.Page 14Nat Chem Biol.

Afterevery hour, 33 \u00b5L of the assay mixture was withdrawn, and diluted to 100 \u00b5L with 50 mMTris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The assay was then digested with 1 \u00b5g of proteomics grade trypsinprotease (Sigma-Aldrich, T7575-1KT) for 45 min at 30 \u00b0C, and stored at -80 \u00b0C untilfurther analysis.Cloning, expression, and purification of Bmp5The ORF encoding Bmp5 was amplified by PCR and ligated into pET28a(+) vector. N-His6-Bmp5 was expressed as previously described for other recombinant proteins in this study.The culture was harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in 25 mL bufferA (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 400 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol) and lysedby sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 45 min. The supernatantwas collected and imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The supernatantwas loaded onto a 5 mL column packed with 1.2 mL (wet volume) Ni-NTA Agarose(Qiagen). The loaded column was rinsed with 10 mL each of buffer A containing 10 mMand 50 mM imidazole. Majority of the recombinant Bmp5 did not bind to the Ni-NTAcolumn and was obtained in the flow through and wash fractions as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Column bound protein was eluted with 5 mL each of buffer A containing 75 mM,100 mM, and 200 mM imidazole. Purified N-His6-Bmp5 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE(Supplementary Fig. 16a). The protein was then desalted to 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 20%glycerol buffer using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters, and immediately used for assays.Bmp5 was found to be very prone to aggregation and precipitation, and care was taken tominimize the time the enzyme was stored prior to assays.Enzyme assays for Bmp5Bmp5 was incubated with 0.5 mM 4-HBA (Sigma-Aldrich, 240141-50G) in a 0.5 mLreaction, along with 5 mM NADPH, 0.1 mM FAD and 10 mM KBr in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0) buffer. After the indicated time points, 40 \u00b5L of reaction aliquots were withdrawn andquenched by the addition of 16 \u00b5L of MeCN + 0.35% TFA, heated at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, andcentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to remove precipitated protein. 25 \u00b5L of the quenchedreaction was injected on a Phenomenex Luna C18 5 \u00b5m (4.6 \u00d7 100 mm) analytical HPLCcolumn operating on an Agilent 1260 analytical HPLC setup at room temperature. Water +0.1% TFA was used as buffer A, and MeCN + 0.1% TFA was used as buffer B.

        "USAAbstract Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polybrominated bipyrroles are natural products thatbioaccumulate in the marine food chain. PBDEs have attracted widespread attention due to theirpersistence in the environment and potential toxicity to humans. However, the natural origins ofPBDE biosynthesis are not known. Here we report marine bacteria as producers of PBDEs andestablish a genetic and molecular foundation for their production that unifies paradigms for theelaboration of bromophenols and bromopyrroles abundant in marine biota.

        "activate and transfer bromide to organic molecules. Marine organisms, including bacteria,algae and invertebrates, are prolific sources of organobromine compounds that number over2200 reported molecules with a wide range of biological properties1\u20132. These brominatednatural products range from simple volatile polybromoalkanes3 to highly complexalkaloids4. Yet, our understanding of the biosynthesis of brominated natural products haslagged far behind their discovery largely because few biosynthetic gene loci have beenidentified and characterized. Herein we report a pervasive marine bacterial pathway topolybrominated aromatic compounds that accounts for a diverse suite of commonpolybrominated pyrrole and phenol-based natural",
        "products.In their hydroxylated (OH-BDE) and methoxylated (MeO-BDE) forms, PBDEs areabundant across all trophic levels of marine life ranging from marine plants5, algae6\u20138 andinvertebrates9\u201312, to marine mammals at the apex of the food chain13\u201315. OH-BDEs andMeO-BDEs detected in marine biota were once thought to be derived from chemicaltransformation of anthropogenically produced polybrominated flame retardants chemicals ofsimilar structure16. However, derivatives such as 2\u2019-MeO-BDE-47, a metabolite widelydetected in the marine metabolome (Fig. 1a), were shown through \u039414C measurements to beof natural origin15. Despite the mounting evidence for the biosynthesis of OH-BDEs in thenatural metabolome, no natural producer of these potential toxins that target mammaliannuclear hormone mediated signaling pathways17 has been",
        "confirmed.An abundance of PBDEs at all trophic levels of marine Eukarya suggests lower trophic levelsources for their genesis. This hypothesis is supported by the production of chemicallysimilar polybrominated molecules, such as 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetrabromo-2,2\u2019-biphenyldiol (1)18,hexabromo-2,2\u2019-bipyrrole (2)19, and the hybrid bromophenol-bromopyrrolepentabromopseudilin (3)19\u201320 (Fig. 1a), by Pseudoalteromonas spp., marine \u03b3-proteobacteriaoften associated with eukaryotic hosts21. While 1\u20132 are not industrially synthesized, theirmethylated analogs are extensively detected in marine mammals14,22 (Fig. 1a).

        "BC30 isolated off the coast of Japan18. We analyzed organic extracts of liquid cultures ofthese marine bacteria grown in the presence of bromide by high performance liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Among numerouspolybrominated molecules present in culture extract of both bacteria, we confirmed theproduction of 1\u20133 by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy of isolated compounds(Figs. 1b, Supplementary Results, Supplementary Figs. 1\u20132 and Supplementary Table 1).Additionally, we confirmed the production of a large series of bromophenol andbromopyrrole monomeric molecules, including 2,4-dibromophenol (4), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (5), 2,3,4-tribromopyrrole (6) and 2,3,4,5-tetrabromopyrrole (7) on the basisof their MS spectra and comparison to synthetic standards (Supplementary Fig. 2 andSupplementary Table",
        "1).Having established experimentally tractable marine bacterial sources for the production of1\u20137, we next sought to determine the genetic basis for the production of thesepolybrominated small molecule marine natural products. Towards this aim, we sequencedthe genomes of P. luteoviolacea 2ta16 and P. phenolica O-BC30, resulting in draft 6.36 Mband 4.76 Mb genomes, respectively. We hypothesized that the bromopyrroles, and byextension the bromopyrrole moieties of heterodimeric molecules such as 3, are derived in amanner analogous to the biosynthesis of the dichlorinated pyrrole moiety of the antifungalnatural product pyoluteorin24, consistent with prior isotope feeding studies tracing thesource of the pyrrole moiety of 3 to L-proline25 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Hence, we queriedthe genomes of P. luteoviolacea 2ta16 and P. phenolica O-BC30 for the prolinedehydrogenase (PltE) and the pyrrole halogenase (PltA) enzymes from pyoluteorinbiosynthesis. This analysis successfully led to the identification of the brominated marinepyrroles/phenols (bmp) biosynthetic gene locus in both bacteria. Homologs of pltE and pltA(bmp3 and bmp2, respectively, Fig. 1c) were found clustered together with genes putativelyencoding an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-thioesterase (TE) di-domain protein (bmp1), prolineadenyltransferase (bmp4), flavin-dependent oxygenase (bmp5), chorismate lyase (bmp6),cytochrome P450 (CYP450, bmp7), ferredoxin (bmp9) and ferredoxin reductase (bmp10),and a carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase homolog (bmp8). Primary sequence similarityof Bmp ORFs to pyoluteorin biosynthetic enzymes is provided in Supplementary Table",
        "2.In order to confirm the contribution of the bmp gene cluster to the biosynthesis of 1\u20137, weconstructed an expression vector and heterologously expressed P. luteoviolacea 2ta16bmp1\u20138 genes in Escherichia coli (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 3 and5). In the presence of bromide, we observed the heterologous production of 1\u20137 (Fig. 2a,b).Note that the complexity of the culture extract precludes a concomitant visual representationof all polybrominated molecules within a single TIC.

As characterized for the biosynthesis of pyrrole moieties in numerous alkaloidnatural products29, the proline adenyltransferase Bmp4, together with flavin-dependentdehydrogenase Bmp3 catalyzed the near stoichiometric conversion of holo-Bmp1 topyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 (Supplementary Figs. 6\u20138, see Supplementary Note 1 for detailedanalytical protocols). Enzymatic conversion was abolished in the absence of eitheradenosine triphosphate (ATP) or L-proline, while reduced conversion was observed in theabsence of Mg2+. These observations were consistent with the proposed reaction scheme foradenyltransferases proceeding via an adenylated amino acid intermediate that issubsequently transferred to the phosphopantetheine sulfhydryl of the ACP with theconcomitant release of adenosine monophosphate",
        "(AMP).Bmp2 is homologous to canonical flavin-dependent halogenases that utilize ACP-tetheredsubstrates30 (Supplementary Fig. 30). Flavin-dependent halogenase enzymes require anexogenous supply of reduced flavin co-factor (FADH2), typically provided in situ by aflavin reductase that catalyzes the reduction of the flavin cofactor with the concomitantoxidation of NAD(P)H24,31. In the presence of E. coli flavin reductase SsuE32, NADPH andbromide, Bmp2 catalyzed the bromination of pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1(ACP) to mono-, di-andtribromopyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 (Fig. 3). This result establishes the in vitro reconstitution of thefirst flavin-dependent halogenase with physiological bromination activity involved in naturalproduct biosynthesis. Assignment of Bmp2 as a brominase is further supported by theobservation that no incorporation of chloride was detected33.

While the esterase activity ofBmp1 TE domain could indeed be confirmed by the hydrolysis of the model esterasesubstrate p-nitrophenylacetate (Supplementary Fig. 10), biochemical investigations into theformation of 6 by Bmp8 were precluded by our inability to generate soluble recombinantBmp8 protein.

        "brominaseIn contrast to assembly of bromopyrroles, the biosynthetic logic for the assembly ofbromophenols, and thereafter of PBDEs and polybrominated biphenyls could not be readilyanticipated. Previous isotope feeding experiments and the presence of chorismate lyase(Bmp6) in the gene cluster suggested 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) as the precursor forthe bromophenol moiety of 335. While the bmp5 deletion experiments postulated its role asthe phenol brominase, lack of sequence similarity of the flavoenzyme Bmp5 to canonicalflavin-dependent halogenases, which includes Bmp2, led to uncertainty in this assignment.Moreover, incorporation of 4-HBA into bromophenols necessitates decarboxylation, atransformation not previously associated with flavin-dependent halogenases. Hence, weundertook a detailed in vitro characterization of the activity of Bmp5. Upon incubation of 4-HBA with recombinant Bmp5 in the presence of bromide, NADPH, and FAD, we observeda time-dependent formation of one major product via a stable intermediate (Fig. 4a andSupplementary Fig. 16). The identity of the intermediate as 3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid(8) and of the product as 4 was confirmed by mass spectrometry and retention timecomparison to authentic synthetic standards (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 17). Bmp5could utilize 8 as a substrate for the synthesis of 4, further establishing 8 as the physiologicalintermediate for the reaction (Fig. 4b). Bmp5 also generated 5 when expressed in E. coli inthe presence of bromide (Supplementary Fig. 17). While production of 5 could not bedetected in vitro, this observation is consistent with the acceptance of 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (9) as a poor substrate by Bmp5 as compared to 4-HBA and 8 (Fig.4b). Bmp5 activity was abolished in the absence of either bromide or NADPH, while apartial reduction in activity was observed upon omission of FAD, consistent with the partialoccupancy of FAD in Bmp5 as purified (Supplementary Fig. 18). Consistent with priorcharacterization of halide specificity of aromatic halogenases33, Bmp5 could utilize iodidein vivo leading to the formation of iodophenols while no chloride incorporation wasobserved (Supplementary Fig.",

The OH-BDE products possess two distinct chemicalsignatures, namely, para-(11\u201312) and ortho-coupling (13) with respect to the hydroxylgroup (Fig. 5b).

Thisobservation provides the first confirmation for marine bacterial biosynthesis of OH-BDEs.11 and 13 are isomeric with 1, and have very similar retention time to each other. Moreover,in contrast to the diagnostic MS2 patterns for polybrominated biphenyls and para-OH-BDEs(see Supplemental Note 2), structural characterization of 13 relied on comparison to anauthentic synthetic standard (Supplementary Fig. 22).

In vitro activity assays of Bmp7 in thepresence of redox partners Bmp9\u201310 and NADH with 6 as a substrate generated 2 and 7 asmajor products (Supplementary Figs. 13\u201315). The identity of reaction products wasconfirmed by comparison to authentic standards. A final demonstration for the biosyntheticversatility for Bmp7 was provided by an in vitro reaction involving the heterodimerizationof 4 and 6.

        "While several Bmp pathway products identified in this study were previously isolated frommarine bacteria (1\u2013318\u201320, 719, 10 and 1540) with 3 being characterized nearly half a centuryago, the genetic and molecular bases of their biosyntheses have remained elusive until now.In this study, we identified a conserved gene locus in Gram-negative marine bacteriaencoding the biosynthesis of at least fifteen polybrominated aromatic marine naturalproducts containing ubiquitous bromopyrrole and bromophenol building blocks. A nearcomplete in vitro reconstitution of all enzymatic steps within the Bmp pathway provides thebasis for a bi-modular biosynthetic scheme as shown in Fig.",
        "6a.The bromopyrrole and bromophenol biosynthetic modules function independently and areunited through the action of CYP450 Bmp7. CYP450-catalyzed phenol coupling reactionshave extensive biochemical precedents, and the formation of polybrominated biphenyls 1and 10, and OH-BDEs 11\u201314 are expected to follow accepted bi-radical mechanisms (Fig.6b). A similar mechanism can be envisaged for coupling of bromopyrroles, consistent withCYP450-catalyzed coupling in indolocarbazole antibiotics42. The modularity of the Bmppathway is reflected in the preservation of only the bromopyrrole biosynthetic module in themarine symbiotic cyanobacterium P. didemni P2-Fiji27 (Fig. 1c). As the bromophenolmodule is absent, it is likely that P. didemni P2-Fiji produces only halogenated pyrroles.Furthermore, a homologous gene locus identified in T. thiocyanoxidans ARh 4 lacks a genecoding for a coupling CYP450 (Fig. 1c). It is conceivable that an even wider applicability ofthe chemical logic described here for the biosynthesis of marine bromophenols andbromopyrroles is limited only by the availability of genomic",

        "electron donor can be readily discerned within the primary sequence of Bmp5(Supplementary Fig. 30). Indeed, bmp5 homologs in the biosynthetic gene clusters identifiedin M. mediterranea MMB-1 and T. thiocyanoxidans ARh 4 are annotated as flavin-dependent oxygenases (Fig. 1c). While decarboxylation was until now an unrealized activitywithin the catalytic repertoire of flavin-dependent halogenases, ortho-hydroxylation of 4-HBA44 as well as para-decarboxylative-hydroxylation of 4-HBA45 have been reported forflavin-dependent oxygenases, leading to a proposal for a two-step reaction schemeemployed by Bmp5 (Fig. 4c). The collective action of an electron-donating phenol hydroxyland electron-withdrawing carboxyl group would first direct electrophilic bromoniumaddition at the ortho position, and subsequent proton abstraction by a catalytic base wouldresult in the formation of 8. This intermediate would then undergo a second bromoniumaddition para to the hydroxyl, followed by decarboxylation to generate 4. The Bmp5reaction is regiospecific, in that ortho bromination is the first half reaction, followed bydecarboxylative-bromination at the para position. This assertion for the strictly directed two-step Bmp5 reaction scheme is supported by 4-bromophenol not being detected as anintermediate, or as a product of the Bmp5 reaction (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the Bmp5 activesite likely sterically occludes bromonium addition at one of the ortho positions of the arylring, thus biasing the second half reaction towards decarboxylative-bromination at the paraposition, rather than a second ortho-bromination to yield 9 as a second intermediate. Thispostulate is supported by the observation that under identical experimental conditions, ratesof decrease of 4-HBA and 8 in an in vitro reaction with Bmp5 are nearly identical, while 9 isa poor substrate for Bmp5 (Fig. 4b). Consequently, 5 is a minor product generated by Bmp5that could not be detected in vitro, but is only detected to be produced in vivo when Bmp5 isheterologously expressed in E. coli in presence of bromide in the culture media(Supplementary Fig. 17). Additionally, Bmp5 could utilize iodide, but not chloride in vivo(Supplementary Fig.",
        "28).It is intriguing that neither bromophenol monomers nor OH-BDEs had previously beenisolated from marine bacterial sources. Bromophenols and OH-BDEs identified in this study(and their methylated derivatives) have instead been extensively detected in marineeukaryotes, ranging from autotrophs and invertebrates, to apex predators5\u201315,46. Whilesponge-associated symbiotic marine cyanobacteria were hinted as producers of OH-BDEs10,a definite genetic basis for OH-BDE biosynthesis had not been established. Furthermore, inthe absence of definitive genetic evidence for algal biosynthesis of OH-BDEs, a contributionof associated bacteria towards the production of OH-BDEs sourced from marine algaecannot be discounted8,12. It is thus noteworthy that all three marine bacteria harboring theBmp pathway as identified in this study also belong to genera commonly associated withmarine eukaryotes. Identification of the bmp gene locus should henceforth aid thecomputational mining of marine metagenomic datasets for the identification of bacterial, aswell as potential eukaryotic OH-BDE producers utilizing similar motifs. Together with 1(Fig. 1a), the methoxylated derivative for 13 (2\u2019-MeO-BDE-68, Fig. 5b), is extensivelydetected in marine mammals and even humans14\u201315, suggesting that bromophenols and OH-BDEs identified in this study bioaccumulate in the marine food web and are transferred tohumans via trophic connections. Furthermore, methylation of OH-BDEs, and by extensionof polybrominated biphenyls and bipyrroles (Fig. 1a), appears to be a facile",

Hence, the detection of para-OH-BDEs,such as 11\u201312, and specifically 14, puts into perspective the toxic potential of themetabolites generated by the Bmp pathway. As the synthesis of biphenyls and diphenylethers could also be confirmed for Bmp7 using polychlorinated and polyiodinated phenolicsubstrates (Supplementary Figs. 25, 28), other naturally occurring polyhalogenated arylcompounds may also be derived from analogous enzymatic pathways with differing halogenspecificities of the halogenases.

A yeast/E. colishuttle vector pGAL-bmp1\u20137 was constructed from PCR amplified fragments encompassingthe vector backbone of the pGAL-MF yeast expression vector (DualSystems) and bmp1\u20137(Supplementary Fig. 4). Primer pairs were designed to amplify a total of five ~2.5 kbregions incorporating ~35 bp flanking regions (Supplementary Table 3). The first twofragments were derived from digested pGAL-MF yeast expression vector, including an E.coli antibiotic resistance marker (AmpR), E. coli origin of replication (pBScri), yeastauxotrophic selective marker (URA3), and yeast origin of replication (2micron). Theremaining three fragments encompassing bmp1\u20137 were amplified from P. luteoviolacea2ta16 gDNA. SpeI and SacI restriction sites were incorporated at the cluster boundaries forintegration into the compatible XbaI and SacI restriction sites of the pETDuet-1 Vector(Novagen). Fragments were amplified by PCR using the PrimeStar HS DNA polymerasestandard protocol (Clontech). PCR amplified fragments were purified using a QIAquickPCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) combined, concentrated, and transformed intoelectrocompetent yeast S. cerevisiae BJ5465. Transformed S. cerevisiae BJ5465 was platedonto yeast minimal media deficient in uracil and incubated for 3 days at 30 \u00b0C. Yeastcolonies were screened for cluster fragments by colony PCR. Yeast colonies positive for allthree fragments of bmp1\u20137 were inoculated in 1.5 mL yeast minimal media and incubatedovernight with shaking at 30 \u00b0C. Candidate pGAL-bmp1\u20137 constructs were extracted using aZymoprep Yeast Plasmid Miniprep I extraction Kit (Zymo Research).
