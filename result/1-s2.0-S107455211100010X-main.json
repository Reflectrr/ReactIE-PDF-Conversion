Within the genus Streptomyces, it acts as a bacterial hormone that induces morphological differentiation and the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. In addition, hormaomycin is an extremely potent narrow-spectrum antibiotic. In this study, we shed light on hormaomycin biosynthesis by a combination of feeding studies, isolation of the biosynthetic nonri-bosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster, and in vivo and in vitro functional analysis of enzymes. In addition, several nonnatural hormaomycin conge-ners were generated by feeding-induced metabolic rerouting. TheNRPScontains numeroushighly repet-itive regions that suggest an evolutionary scenario for this unusual bacterial hormone, providing new opportunities for evolution-inspired metabolic engi-neering of novel nonribosomal peptides. INTRODUCTION Streptomycetes, an exceptionally rich bacterial source of natural products, employ a complex network of signaling factors to regulate their secondary metabolism (Bibb, 2005; Rokem et al., 2007). While most of the identified signals are intracellular proteins, a small number of low-molecular weight compounds have been identified that diffuse away from the producer and trigger biosynthetic and morphological events at more remote locations in the bacterial community (Horinouchi and Beppu, 1994; Igarashi et al., 2001; Kondo et al., 1987; Recio et al., 2004; Takano, 2006). These substances (Figure 1) exhibit diverse structures, the most unusual being displayed by hormaomycin (1) (Reinscheid et al., 2006; Ro\u0308ssner et al., 1990; Zlatopolskiy et al., 2004), also known as takaokamycin (Omura et al., 1984). Chemistry & Biology 18, 3 At nanomolar concentrations, this depsipeptide stimulates the production of antibiotics and the formation of aerial mycelium in various actinomycetes (Andres et al., 1989, 1990). In addition to the interspecies hormonal activity, 1 exhibits extremely potent narrow-spectrum antibiotic activities against coryneform actino-mycetes (lowest measured MIC value 88 pM) (Andres et al., 1990). To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse activities are unknown. The structure of 1, which has been confirmed by total synthesis (Zlatopolskiy and de Meijere, 2004), is unique among signaling metabolites. It contains several unprecedented resi-dues with chlorine, nitro, and cyclopropyl moieties in addition to a single proteinogenic amino acid, L-Ile. To date, limited infor-mation on the biosynthesis of only one residue exists. Feeding studies established that the 3-(trans-20-nitrocyclopropyl)alanine ([3-Ncp]Ala [5]) unit is derived from L-lysine (Brandl et al., 2004) via functionalization of the g-position and oxidation of the u-amino group, but the individual enzymatic steps leading to this amino acid are unknown. Feeding studies also revealed that various analogs of amino acids can be readily incorporated into 1 (Kozhushkov et al., 2005; Zlatopolskiy et al., 2006) and demonstrated that this approach can result in dramatic changes of the pharmacological profile (Zlatopolskiy et al., 2006). In particular, hormaomycin D2 containing a 5-nitronorvaline residue at one (3-Ncp)-Ala site exhibits a high antifungal activity against Candida albicans, while 1 itself is completely inactive. These data suggest an inherent catalytic flexibility of the biosynthetic machinery that could be exploited by metabolic engineering and mutasynthesis to generate novel bioactive peptides. To provide the foundation for such studies and obtain deeper insights into the biosynthesis of 1, we report here feeding exper-iments, precursor-directed biosynthesis studies, isolation of the biosynthetic gene cluster and in vivo and in vivo functional exper-iments on several genes that reveal new insights into the assembly of this unique peptide.

HPLC-MS Analysis of L-DOPA (9) Chemistry & Biology Hormaomycin Biosynthesis attributed to the [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ forms, respectively, of a compound with the molecular formula C9H9NO5. Since this composition preciselymatches to 16 and there was no indication for the formation of a downstream cleavage product, such as 17, a role of HrmF in further cleavage of 16 is unlikely. To further characterize the HrmF-catalyzed reaction in vitro, the His8-tagged protein was prepared (Figure S3C) and assayed in vitro with 13 in the presence of ascorbic acid. For a kinetic analysis, formation of the yellow cleavage product at different concentra-tion of 13 was monitored at 414 nm (Figure S3D). The data support a KM of 3.35 mM and a kcat of 57.8 min -1, which corre-spond to a significantly higher catalytic efficiency than displayed by the homolog LmbB1 (KM = 38 mM, kcat = 4.2 min -1) (Colabroy et al., 2008). (3-Ncp)Ala Biosynthesis Given the putative gene assignments already made, surprisingly few genes remain that might be attributed to (3-Ncp)Ala (5) production. Incorporation experiments suggested that this amino acid is generated from L-lysine via 4-hydroxylysine or its lactone, leading to the proposal that cyclopropanation is achieved by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution at the acti-vated position 4 (Figure 5D) (Brandl et al., 2004). The only protein with a predictable role in lysine metabolism is HrmT, which displays high similarity to diaminopimelate epimerases cata-lyzing the penultimate step in lysine biosynthesis (Scapin and Blanchard, 1998). HrmT could therefore play a role in diverting lysine precursors from primary metabolism to hormaomycin biosynthesis. Of the remaining unassigned genes, hrmR is highly similar to the mbtH gene family, members of which are associ-ated with many NRPS pathways and can positively influence amino acid activation (Drake et al., 2007; Felnagle et al., 2010; Lautru et al., 2007; Stegmann et al., 2006; Wolpert et al., 2007). A role in 5 formation is therefore unlikely. This leaves only two genes, hrmI and hrmJ, as candidates. Bioinformatic analyses provided no insights into their possible function, since only a few uncharacterized relatives exist. No obvious homologs of enzymes that were previously shown to be involved in cyclo-propanation, such as a-ketoglutarate/Fe2+-dependent halo-genases or a CmaC-related protein (Gu et al., 2009; Kelly et al., 2007; Vaillancourt et al., 2005) were found encoded in the hrm cluster or elsewhere in the genome. Functional studies on hrmI and hrmJ are currently under way to examine their role in hormaomycin biosynthesis. SIGNIFICANCE The bacterial depsipeptide hormaomycin from Strepto-myces griseoflavusW-384 is unique among pro-and eukary-otic hormones both in terms of its complex, highly unusual structure and its dual activity as an inducing agent and potent narrow-spectrum antibiotic. Isolation of the biosyn-thetic gene cluster reveals a complex evolutionary history of the pathway consisting of DNA duplication and recombi-nation events that resulted in switches of adenylation domain selectivity. Extensive feeding and enzymatic studies were conducted that yielded several novel hormao-mycins and provide insights into the formation of most of the amino acids. The unique 3-propenylproline moiety is 388 Chemistry & Biology 18, 381\u2013391, March 25, 2011 \u00aa2011 Elsevie generated from L-tyrosine via a pathway involving cleavage of L-DOPA, while the unprecedented chlorinated pyrrole derivative Chpca is generated from proline. The study provides the foundation for engineering experiments to generate further hormaomycin analogs that may aid in the identification and exploitation of bacterial signaling path-ways and the as-yet unknownmolecular target in antibiosis. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES General One-and two-dimensional 1H-and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova-600, Varian Inova-500, Varian Mercury-300, Varian Unity-300 and Bruker AMX 300 spectrometer in CDCl3 using the solvent signals as the reference. MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker autoflex II TOF/TOF time of flight mass spectrometer. Electrospray high-resolution mass spectra and collision-induced dissociation (CID) MSn spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF-Q time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and Bruker Apex-Q III and Bruker APEX IV Fourier-transform ion cyclotron-reso-nance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers with 7.05 T magnets. Instruments were equipped with an Apollo electrospray ion source. Analyte solutions in acetoni-trile were introduced into the ion source with a syringe pump (Cole-Parmers Instruments, Series 74900) at flow rates of 3 to 4 ml min-1 or with an Agilent HPLC pump (1200 series) at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. Thin layer chromatog-raphy was performed on silica gel 60 F254 plates (layer thickness 0.2 mm, Merck). Analytical HPLC separation was performed on a PerfectChrom 100 C18 reverse-phase analytic column (250 3 4 mm, 5 mm) with a flow rate 1 ml min-1. The compounds were detected with a Jasco MD-2015 PDA detector at the wavelengths 280 or 413 nm. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions E. coli BL21(DE3) served as the host strain for heterologous expression exper-iments. S. griseoflavus W-384 was grown on M2+ plates or in NM6 or NM10 liquid medium (Brandl et al., 2004). E. coli strain XL1 blue served as host for routine subcloning. For intergeneric conjugation E. coli ET12567 containing the RP4 derivative pUZ8002 was used (Kieser et al., 2000). E. coli strains were grown in LBmedium supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg ml-1), or apra-mycin (50 mg ml-1), or streptomycin (50 mg ml-1), or kanamycin (50 mg ml-1) for selection. For overexpression, 1 liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the expression plasmid were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 (37 NoneC, 200rpm), IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM and cells were grown for approximately 20 hr at 16NoneC. Plasmids and General DNA Procedures DNA isolation, plasmid preparation, restriction digests, gel electrophoresis, and ligation reactions were conducted according to standard methods (Kieser et al., 2000; Sambrook and Russel, 2001). pBluescript II SK(-) was the routine vector for subcloning and preparation of DNA templates for sequencing. For overexpression and purification, hrm Genes were cloned into the expression vector pHIS8 (Jez et al., 2000). Purification of Proteins The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 min) at 4NoneC and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 10mM imidazole. The cell suspension was kept on ice and sonicated in 10 s intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 30 min at 4NoneC. The supernatant was incubated with 1.5 ml Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN) for 1 hr at 4NoneC andwashed with 5ml lysis buffer. His-tagged proteins were eluted in 1 ml fractions with lysis buffer containing rising imidazole concentrations (50\u2013300 mM). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford (RotiNanoquant, Roth) and protein containing fractions were pooled and desalted using HiTrap Columns (GE). Isolation and Sequencing of the hrm Genes A library of Streptomyces griseoflavus W-384 DNA in E. coli EPI305 was con-structed in the cosmid vector pWEB (Epicenter). 2000 clones were picked into 96-well microtiter plates. A 1200 bp fragment encoding an A domain of the r Ltd All rights reserved Chemistry & Biology Hormaomycin Biosynthesis friulimicin gene cluster was excised with EcoRI out of the plasmid pK19 (kind gift of D. Schwartz, Esslingen). A 32P-labeled hybridization probe prepared from this fragment served to identify positive cosmids. The positives were further screened with a 32P-labeled probe prepared from the gene cloN4 of the clorobiocin cluster (kind gift of L. Heide, Tu\u0308bingen). The two positive cosmids pHR6G10 and pHR1F4 were sonicated, end-repaired by BAL-31 and Klenow fragment and size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis to obtain fragments of 1\u20132 kb lengths. These were ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK(-) and end sequenced with the BigDye Terminator Ready Mix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Remaining gaps were filled by targeted subcloning and the use of specific primers. For genome screening of lmbX homologs, degenerate primers hrmXfor (50-CAR GAR TGY GGN DSN MGN-30 ) and hrmXrev (50-NGW HGC RCA NGC NGG RTC-30) were used. The lmbX gene fragment was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of lincomycin producer Streptomyces lincolnensis NRRL 2936 using primers lmbXfor(50-GGA ATT CAT GAT CGT GGT CCC-30 ) and lmbXrev(50-CCC AAG CTT CTA CAC GGA AGC-30). PCR products were ligated into pBluescript SK(+) to get pXC7 and end sequenced. The lmbX gene fragment was digested with HindIII and EcoRI from pXC7 and labeled by DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling Kit as a probe to detect a possible lmbX homolog in either the genomic DNA or the arrayed library by Southern blot. Kinetic Characterization of HrmF The gene hrmF was amplified by PCR using primers hrmFfor (50-GGA TCC CCC GAG AAC CTC G-30) and hrmFrev (50-AAG CTT TCA CCC CGC CGA CT-30). PCR products were ligated into pBluescript SK(+) via TA cloning (Marchuk et al., 1991) to give pDF017. After restriction digest with BamHI and HindIII the genes were ligated into the same restriction sites of the expres-sion vector pHIS8 to give pDF024. The overexpressed protein was purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Desalted HrmF in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8) was treated with L-DOPA in different concentrations. A typical assay, adapted from the literature (Colabroy et al., 2008), consisted of 25 ml enzyme (1.3 mM), 10 mML-DOPA, and 10 mMascorbic acid in 500 ml phosphate buffer (100 mM [pH 8]). The enzymatic activity wasmonitored by measuring the absorbance increase at 414 nm resulting from the formation of the yellow cleavage product (3 = 20.300 \u00b1 890 M-1 cm-1) for 30 min using a BioMate 3 photometer (Thermo). Experiments were performed in triplicate. For determi-nation of kinetic parameters initial rates were plotted versus the substrate concentration and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the Hanes-Woolf Plot. Mass-Exchange Based Adenylation Assay of the HrmP1 A-Domain The A domain region of the module HrmP1 was amplified by PCR using primers hrmP1for (50-AAA GAA TTC GGC CGG CTG GAC GTC GT-30 ) and hrmP1rev (50-AAA AAG CTT TCA CTC CTC CTG CGC GGT ACG CG-30). PCR products were ligated into pBluescript SK(+) with TA cloning. After restriction digest with EcoRI and HindIII, the insert was ligated into the same sites of the expression vector pHIS8, and the resulting plasmid was trans-formed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The overexpressed protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The desalted enzyme in Tris HCl (50 mM, pH 7.5) was incubated with labeled [g-18O4]-ATP, various test substrates, MgCl2 and pyrophosphate as previously described (Phelan et al., 2009). The mass exchange of 8 D was observed by MALDI-TOF-MS.

Within the genus Streptomyces, it acts as a bacterial hormone that induces morphological differentiation and the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. In addition, hormaomycin is an extremely potent narrow-spectrum antibiotic. In this study, we shed light on hormaomycin biosynthesis by a combination of feeding studies, isolation of the biosynthetic nonri-bosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster, and in vivo and in vitro functional analysis of enzymes. In addition, several nonnatural hormaomycin conge-ners were generated by feeding-induced metabolic rerouting. TheNRPScontains numeroushighly repet-itive regions that suggest an evolutionary scenario for this unusual bacterial hormone, providing new opportunities for evolution-inspired metabolic engi-neering of novel nonribosomal peptides. INTRODUCTION Streptomycetes, an exceptionally rich bacterial source of natural products, employ a complex network of signaling factors to regulate their secondary metabolism (Bibb, 2005; Rokem et al., 2007). While most of the identified signals are intracellular proteins, a small number of low-molecular weight compounds have been identified that diffuse away from the producer and trigger biosynthetic and morphological events at more remote locations in the bacterial community (Horinouchi and Beppu, 1994; Igarashi et al., 2001; Kondo et al., 1987; Recio et al., 2004; Takano, 2006). These substances (Figure 1) exhibit diverse structures, the most unusual being displayed by hormaomycin (1) (Reinscheid et al., 2006; Ro\u0308ssner et al., 1990; Zlatopolskiy et al., 2004), also known as takaokamycin (Omura et al., 1984).",
        "Chemistry & Biology 18, 3",
        "At nanomolar concentrations, this depsipeptide stimulates the production of antibiotics and the formation of aerial mycelium in various actinomycetes (Andres et al., 1989, 1990). In addition to the interspecies hormonal activity, 1 exhibits extremely potent narrow-spectrum antibiotic activities against coryneform actino-mycetes (lowest measured MIC value 88 pM) (Andres et al., 1990). To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse activities are unknown. The structure of 1, which has been confirmed by total synthesis (Zlatopolskiy and de Meijere, 2004), is unique among signaling metabolites. It contains several unprecedented resi-dues with chlorine, nitro, and cyclopropyl moieties in addition to a single proteinogenic amino acid, L-Ile. To date, limited infor-mation on the biosynthesis of only one residue exists. Feeding studies established that the 3-(trans-20-nitrocyclopropyl)alanine ([3-Ncp]Ala [5]) unit is derived from L-lysine (Brandl et al., 2004) via functionalization of the g-position and oxidation of the u-amino group, but the individual enzymatic steps leading to this amino acid are unknown. Feeding studies also revealed that various analogs of amino acids can be readily incorporated into 1 (Kozhushkov et al., 2005; Zlatopolskiy et al., 2006) and demonstrated that this approach can result in dramatic changes of the pharmacological profile (Zlatopolskiy et al., 2006). In particular, hormaomycin D2 containing a 5-nitronorvaline residue at one (3-Ncp)-Ala site exhibits a high antifungal activity against Candida albicans, while 1 itself is completely inactive. These data suggest an inherent catalytic flexibility of the biosynthetic machinery that could be exploited by metabolic engineering and mutasynthesis to generate novel bioactive peptides. To provide the foundation for such studies and obtain deeper insights into the biosynthesis of 1, we report here feeding exper-iments, precursor-directed biosynthesis studies, isolation of the biosynthetic gene cluster and in vivo and in vivo functional exper-iments on several genes that reveal new insights into the assembly of this unique peptide.",

        "attributed to the [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ forms, respectively, of a compound with the molecular formula C9H9NO5. Since this composition preciselymatches to 16 and there was no indication for the formation of a downstream cleavage product, such as 17, a role of HrmF in further cleavage of 16 is unlikely. To further characterize the HrmF-catalyzed reaction in vitro, the His8-tagged protein was prepared (Figure S3C) and assayed in vitro with 13 in the presence of ascorbic acid. For a kinetic analysis, formation of the yellow cleavage product at different concentra-tion of 13 was monitored at 414 nm (Figure S3D). The data support a KM of 3.35 mM and a kcat of 57.8 min -1, which corre-spond to a significantly higher catalytic efficiency than displayed by the homolog LmbB1 (KM = 38 mM, kcat = 4.2 min -1) (Colabroy et al., 2008).",
        "(3-Ncp)Ala Biosynthesis Given the putative gene assignments already made, surprisingly few genes remain that might be attributed to (3-Ncp)Ala (5) production. Incorporation experiments suggested that this amino acid is generated from L-lysine via 4-hydroxylysine or its lactone, leading to the proposal that cyclopropanation is achieved by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution at the acti-vated position 4 (Figure 5D) (Brandl et al., 2004). The only protein with a predictable role in lysine metabolism is HrmT, which displays high similarity to diaminopimelate epimerases cata-lyzing the penultimate step in lysine biosynthesis (Scapin and Blanchard, 1998). HrmT could therefore play a role in diverting lysine precursors from primary metabolism to hormaomycin biosynthesis. Of the remaining unassigned genes, hrmR is highly similar to the mbtH gene family, members of which are associ-ated with many NRPS pathways and can positively influence amino acid activation (Drake et al., 2007; Felnagle et al., 2010; Lautru et al., 2007; Stegmann et al., 2006; Wolpert et al., 2007). A role in 5 formation is therefore unlikely. This leaves only two genes, hrmI and hrmJ, as candidates. Bioinformatic analyses provided no insights into their possible function, since only a few uncharacterized relatives exist. No obvious homologs of enzymes that were previously shown to be involved in cyclo-propanation, such as a-ketoglutarate/Fe2+-dependent halo-genases or a CmaC-related protein (Gu et al., 2009; Kelly et al., 2007; Vaillancourt et al., 2005) were found encoded in the hrm cluster or elsewhere in the genome. Functional studies on hrmI and hrmJ are currently under way to examine their role in hormaomycin biosynthesis.",
        "SIGNIFICANCE",
        "The bacterial depsipeptide hormaomycin from Strepto-myces griseoflavusW-384 is unique among pro-and eukary-otic hormones both in terms of its complex, highly unusual structure and its dual activity as an inducing agent and potent narrow-spectrum antibiotic. Isolation of the biosyn-thetic gene cluster reveals a complex evolutionary history of the pathway consisting of DNA duplication and recombi-nation events that resulted in switches of adenylation domain selectivity. Extensive feeding and enzymatic studies were conducted that yielded several novel hormao-mycins and provide insights into the formation of most of the amino acids.

The study provides the foundation for engineering experiments to generate further hormaomycin analogs that may aid in the identification and exploitation of bacterial signaling path-ways and the as-yet unknownmolecular target in antibiosis.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES General One-and two-dimensional 1H-and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova-600, Varian Inova-500, Varian Mercury-300, Varian Unity-300 and Bruker AMX 300 spectrometer in CDCl3 using the solvent signals as the reference. MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker autoflex II TOF/TOF time of flight mass spectrometer. Electrospray high-resolution mass spectra and collision-induced dissociation (CID) MSn spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF-Q time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and Bruker Apex-Q III and Bruker APEX IV Fourier-transform ion cyclotron-reso-nance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers with 7.05 T magnets. Instruments were equipped with an Apollo electrospray ion source. Analyte solutions in acetoni-trile were introduced into the ion source with a syringe pump (Cole-Parmers Instruments, Series 74900) at flow rates of 3 to 4 ml min-1 or with an Agilent HPLC pump (1200 series) at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. Thin layer chromatog-raphy was performed on silica gel 60 F254 plates (layer thickness 0.2 mm, Merck). Analytical HPLC separation was performed on a PerfectChrom 100 C18 reverse-phase analytic column (250 3 4 mm, 5 mm) with a flow rate 1 ml min-1. The compounds were detected with a Jasco MD-2015 PDA detector at the wavelengths 280 or 413 nm. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions E. coli BL21(DE3) served as the host strain for heterologous expression exper-iments. S. griseoflavus W-384 was grown on M2+ plates or in NM6 or NM10 liquid medium (Brandl et al., 2004). E. coli strain XL1 blue served as host for routine subcloning. For intergeneric conjugation E. coli ET12567 containing the RP4 derivative pUZ8002 was used (Kieser et al., 2000). E. coli strains were grown in LBmedium supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg ml-1), or apra-mycin (50 mg ml-1), or streptomycin (50 mg ml-1), or kanamycin (50 mg ml-1) for selection. For overexpression, 1 liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the expression plasmid were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 (37 NoneC, 200rpm), IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM and cells were grown for approximately 20 hr at 16NoneC. Plasmids and General DNA Procedures DNA isolation, plasmid preparation, restriction digests, gel electrophoresis, and ligation reactions were conducted according to standard methods (Kieser et al., 2000; Sambrook and Russel, 2001). pBluescript II SK(-) was the routine vector for subcloning and preparation of DNA templates for sequencing. For overexpression and purification, hrm Genes were cloned into the expression vector pHIS8 (Jez et al., 2000). Purification of Proteins The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 min) at 4NoneC and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 10mM imidazole. The cell suspension was kept on ice and sonicated in 10 s intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 30 min at 4NoneC. The supernatant was incubated with 1.5 ml Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN) for 1 hr at 4NoneC andwashed with 5ml lysis buffer. His-tagged proteins were eluted in 1 ml fractions with lysis buffer containing rising imidazole concentrations (50\u2013300 mM). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford (RotiNanoquant, Roth) and protein containing fractions were pooled and desalted using HiTrap Columns (GE). Isolation and Sequencing of the hrm Genes A library of Streptomyces griseoflavus W-384 DNA in E. coli EPI305 was con-structed in the cosmid vector pWEB (Epicenter). 2000 clones were picked into 96-well microtiter plates.

        "Chemistry & Biology Hormaomycin Biosynthesis friulimicin gene cluster was excised with EcoRI out of the plasmid pK19 (kind gift of D. Schwartz, Esslingen). A 32P-labeled hybridization probe prepared from this fragment served to identify positive cosmids. The positives were further screened with a 32P-labeled probe prepared from the gene cloN4 of the clorobiocin cluster (kind gift of L. Heide, Tu\u0308bingen). The two positive cosmids pHR6G10 and pHR1F4 were sonicated, end-repaired by BAL-31 and Klenow fragment and size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis to obtain fragments of 1\u20132 kb lengths. These were ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK(-) and end sequenced with the BigDye Terminator Ready Mix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Remaining gaps were filled by targeted subcloning and the use of specific primers. For genome screening of lmbX homologs, degenerate primers hrmXfor (50-CAR GAR TGY GGN DSN MGN-30 ) and hrmXrev (50-NGW HGC RCA NGC NGG RTC-30) were used. The lmbX gene fragment was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of lincomycin producer Streptomyces lincolnensis NRRL 2936 using primers lmbXfor(50-GGA ATT CAT GAT CGT GGT CCC-30 ) and lmbXrev(50-CCC AAG CTT CTA CAC GGA AGC-30). PCR products were ligated into pBluescript SK(+) to get pXC7 and end sequenced. The lmbX gene fragment was digested with HindIII and EcoRI from pXC7 and labeled by DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling Kit as a probe to detect a possible lmbX homolog in either the genomic DNA or the arrayed library by Southern blot. Kinetic Characterization of HrmF The gene hrmF was amplified by PCR using primers hrmFfor (50-GGA TCC CCC GAG AAC CTC G-30) and hrmFrev (50-AAG CTT TCA CCC CGC CGA CT-30). PCR products were ligated into pBluescript SK(+) via TA cloning (Marchuk et al., 1991) to give pDF017. After restriction digest with BamHI and HindIII the genes were ligated into the same restriction sites of the expres-sion vector pHIS8 to give pDF024. The overexpressed protein was purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Desalted HrmF in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8) was treated with L-DOPA in different concentrations. A typical assay, adapted from the literature (Colabroy et al., 2008), consisted of 25 ml enzyme (1.3 mM), 10 mML-DOPA, and 10 mMascorbic acid in 500 ml phosphate buffer (100 mM [pH 8]). The enzymatic activity wasmonitored by measuring the absorbance increase at 414 nm resulting from the formation of the yellow cleavage product (3 = 20.300 \u00b1 890 M-1 cm-1) for 30 min using a BioMate 3 photometer (Thermo). Experiments were performed in triplicate. For determi-nation of kinetic parameters initial rates were plotted versus the substrate concentration and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the Hanes-Woolf Plot. Mass-Exchange Based Adenylation Assay of the HrmP1 A-Domain The A domain region of the module HrmP1 was amplified by PCR using primers hrmP1for (50-AAA GAA TTC GGC CGG CTG GAC GTC GT-30 ) and hrmP1rev (50-AAA AAG CTT TCA CTC CTC CTG CGC GGT ACG CG-30). PCR products were ligated into pBluescript SK(+) with TA cloning. After restriction digest with EcoRI and HindIII, the insert was ligated into the same sites of the expression vector pHIS8, and the resulting plasmid was trans-formed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The overexpressed protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The desalted enzyme in Tris HCl (50 mM, pH 7.5) was incubated with labeled [g-18O4]-ATP, various test substrates, MgCl2 and pyrophosphate as previously described (Phelan et al., 2009). The mass exchange of 8 D was observed by MALDI-TOF-MS.
