Apel*[a, b] Introduction Aminocoumarin antibiotics are produced by Streptomyces strains and defined by their 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety. So far, five aminocoumarins: novobiocin, clorobiocin, coumermycin A1, simocyclinone D8, and rubradirin (Scheme 1), have been discovered, and their biosynthetic gene clusters have been published and investigated over the last two de-cades.[1] Novobiocin (Albamycin) was licensed in the USA in 1964 as an antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococ-cus aureus strains (MRSA),[2] but was withdrawn from sale by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 because of its side effects and the availability of better therapeutic agents. It is still widely used in veterinary medicine (Albadry, Biodry) for preventing mastitis of dairy cows.[3] Clorobiocin and coumer-mycin A1 are even more potent as antibacterial agents. [4] The three classical aminocoumarins novobiocin, clorobiocin, and coumermycin A1 are well-known as potent inhibitors of bacterial gyrase.[5] Bacterial DNA gyrases are among the best-investigated antibacterial targets.[6] They are heterotetrameric enzymes consisting of two GyrA and two GyrB subunits that catalyze the ATP-dependent negative supercoiling of DNA. The three classical aminocoumarins target the GyrB subunit, in con-trast to fluoroquinolones, which attack the GyrA subunit of bacterial gyrase. X-ray crystallographic analysis showed that both the aminocoumarin moiety and the substituted desoxy-sugar moiety (Scheme 1) are involved in binding to the GyrB subunit and, therefore, both moieties are essential for antibiot-ic activity.[7] More recently, novobiocin and its derivatives have also been identified as potent inhibitors of heat shock protein Hsp90[8] and, recently, as inhibitors of HIF1a and the p300/CBP interaction,[9] suggesting their potential as antitumor com-pounds and against protozoan infections such as trypanoso-miasis.[10] Simocyclinone D8 has no desoxysugar moiety at the 7-OH of the aminocoumarin moiety but was unexpectedly found to be a more powerful gyrase inhibitor than novobio-cin.[11] A completely new mechanism of gyrase inhibition was subsequently reported for simocyclinone D8,[12] in which it interacts with two separate pockets within the N-terminal domain of the GyrA subunit. Rubradirin is methylated at the 7-OH of the aminocoumarin ring and, in contrast to the previ-ously mentioned aminocoumarin antibiotics, exhibits antibac-terial activity by a distinct mechanism, inhibiting translation at the bacterial ribosomes.[13] Genome mining led to the discovery of a novel aminocoumar-in gene cluster in the rare actinomycete Catenulispora acidiphi-la DSM 44928. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of genes putatively involved in export/resistance, regulation, and biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin moiety and its halogena-tion, as well as several genes with so far unknown function. Two new aminocoumarins, cacibiocin A and B, were identified in the culture broth of C. acidiphila. Heterologous expression of the putative gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 confirmed that this cluster is responsible for cacibiocin biosyn-thesis. Furthermore, total production levels of cacibiocins could be increased by heterologous expression and screening of different culture media from an initial yield of 4.9 mg LNone1 in C. acidiphila to 60 mg LNone1 in S. coelicolor M1152. By HR-MS and NMR analysis, cacibiocin A was found to contain a 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety linked by an amide bond to a pyr-role-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. The latter structural motif has not been identified previously in any natural compound. Addition-ally, cacibiocin B contains two chlorine atoms at positions 6\u2019 and 8\u2019 of the aminocoumarin moiety. [a] J. Zettler, Dr. H. Xia, Prof. Dr. L. Heide, Dr. A. K.

KGaA, Weinheim ChemBioChem 2014, 15, 612 \u2013 621 612 CHEMBIOCHEM FULL PAPERS The aminocoumarin moiety is rare in nature and has only been reported in the five aminocoumarin antibiotics described above. All five biosynthetic gene clusters contain orthologues of the genes involved in the formation of the 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety, first described for novobiocin as novH, novI, novJ, and novK.[14] NovH activates tyrosine by ade-nylate formation and subsequent binding to a phosphopante-theinyl cofactor. The activated tyrosine is then hydroxylated at the b-position by NovI, a cytochrome P450 enzyme.[14b] The MbtH-like proteins CloY and SimY are strictly required for the activity of the NovH orthologues CloH and SimH, and they also stimulate NovH activity.[15] NovJ and NovK are involved in the oxidation of covalently enzyme-bound b-hydroxytyrosine to b-ketotyrosine.[16] The ring oxygen atom of the aminocoumarin moiety is derived from atmospheric oxygen,[17] suggesting that 2-hydroxylation takes place before lactonization. However, the final steps leading to the formation of the aminocoumarin moiety are still unknown. In the biosynthesis of all five amino-coumarins, an amide synthetase such as NovL links the 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety to an acyl moiety.[18] The aminocoumarin moiety can be further modified at position 8. In case of novobiocin or coumermycin A1, it is methylated by NovO or CouO, and in the case of clorobiocin and simocyclin-one D8, it is chlorinated by Clohal or SimC6.[14a] Recently, the identification of coumermycins from an actino-mycete strain of the genus Actinoallomurus was reported.[19] This was the first time aminocoumarins were described outside of the genus Streptomyces. The fast-growing number of bacte-rial genome sequences in the databases, including an increas-ing number of rare actinomycetes, offers a new chance to dis-cover aminocoumarins by genome mining. In this study, we describe the structure of two new aminocoumarins, cacibiocin A and B, which were identified by genome mining and heterol-ogous expression of a newly discovered aminocoumarin gene cluster from the rare actinomycete Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928. Results Identification of a new aminocoumarin gene cluster by genome mining and bioinformatic sequence analysis Screening of actinobacteria sequences deposited in the NCBI GenBank database, by using the tblastx algorithm, for genes with high similarity to the four aminocoumarin biosynthesis genes novH, novI, novJ, and novK led to the identification of a putative aminocoumarin gene cluster in the genome of Cate-nulispora acidiphila DSM 44928.[20] C. acidiphila has been stud-ied previously for the production of bioactive compounds,[21] but no aminocoumarins have been described. The identified gene cluster contains genes homologous to novH, novI, novJ, and novK, that is, caci_2723 (hereafter termed cabH), caci_2722 (cabI), caci_2720 (cabJ), and caci_2718 (cabK). In addition, caci_ 2721 (cabY) encodes an MbtH-like protein with high similarity to SimY and CloY from the simocyclinone and clorobiocin bio-synthetic gene clusters. However, the C terminus of CabY con-Scheme 1. Structures of aminocoumarin antibiotics. The aminocoumarin moiety is shown in bold. tains 30 additional amino acids, which is unusual in the super-family of MbtH-like proteins (Table 1). In between cabJ and cabK (see Figure 1), we found an additional coding sequence (CDS), caci_2719 (cabR9), coding for a 164 amino acid (aa) pro-tein with unknown function, for which no close homologues can be found in the NCBI databases. Gene caci_2717 (cabL), located downstream of cabK, codes for an amide synthetase with 58 % amino acid identity to CouL, which catalyzes the for-mation of the amide bond between the central pyrrole moiety and the aminocoumarin moieties in coumermycins.[22] All seven genes named above are transcribed in the same direction. It is possible that they form an operon together with the three adjacent genes: caci_2716 (cabR10), caci_2715 (cabR11), and caci_2714 (cabR12), as the predicted coding se-quences of cabL, cabR10, and cabR11 overlap, and the inter-genic region in front of cabR12 comprises only 6 bp. The genes cabR10 and cabR11 encode a putative pyroxidal-5\u2019-phos-phate-dependent protein and an FAD-dependent oxidoreduc-tase, whereas cabR12 encodes a putative Na+/H+ antiporter possibly involved in the export of cacibiocins. Six further CDSs situated downstream of cabR12 are tran-scribed in the same direction: hypothetical protein caci_2713 (cds1), calcium binding protein caci_2712 (cds2), DUF556 domain-containing protein caci_2711 (cds3), putative aldehyde dehydrogenase caci_2710 (cds4), putative alcohol dehydrogen-ase caci_2709 (cds5), and methyltransferase caci_2708 (cds6). It remains unclear whether these six genes are involved in secon-dary metabolism. Two putative promoters could be situated in the intergenic regions upstream of cds1 (78 bp) and cds2 (160 bp). On the other side of the cluster, upstream of cabH (see Figure 1), gene caci_2724 (cabhal) is transcribed in the oppo-site direction and encodes a halogenase with 72 % amino acid identity to SimC6 from the simocyclinone biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting that the identified cluster might be respon-sible for production of a chlorinated aminocoumarin. Down-stream of the halogenase cabhal, we identified two regulatory genes: caci_2725 (cabR8), belonging to the luxR-family, and caci_2727 (cabR7), belonging to the tetR-family, as well as gene caci_2726 (cabR5), which encodes a transporter with 50 % amino acid identity to CouR5 from the coumermycin A1 clus-ter.[23] We speculated that the borders of the identified aminocou-marin cluster might be represented by genes cabR7 and cabR12. However, it cannot be overlooked that the cluster also comprises cds1\u20136. Downstream of cabR7, the genes caci_2728 and caci_2729 encode two putative a-l-arabinofuranosidases, whereas on the other site of the cluster, downstream of cds6, the genes caci_2707 and caci_2706 encode two low-conserved hypothetical proteins, followed by the genes caci_2705 and caci_2704, encoding a putative heat shock protein Hsp18 tran-scriptional regulator and a putative heat shock protein Hsp20. These gene annotations are not suggestive of an involvement in secondary metabolism. Two new aminocoumarins produced by Catenulispora acidiphila To discover new possible aminocoumarins produced by C. acid-iphila, the bacteria were grown in a chemically defined medium (CDM) originally developed for novobiocin produc-tion,[24] extracted, and examined by HPLC and LC-MS. HPLC analysis yielded two product peaks with UV absorption spectra similar to that of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin, characterized by absorption maxima at 280 nm and 320 nm (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Using both parent ion scan MS and product ion scan MS, we could confirm that one of the two compounds, termed cacibiocin A, gave the ex-pected fragment for an unsubstituted dihydroxyaminocoumar-in moiety (m/z 192). The other compound, termed cacibiocin B, gave a fragment of m/z 260, consistent with a dichlorinated di-hydroxyaminocoumarin moiety. The molecular masses of caci-biocin A and cacibiocin B were determined to be 330 g molNone1 and 397.9 g molNone1. As expected, a clear pattern of a dichlorinat-ed compound was visible for cacibiocin B with three masses of Table 1. Identified coding sequences (cds) in the biosynthetic gene cluster of cacibiocin. 397.9, 399.9, and 401.9 g molNone1 in a ratio of 57.4:36.7:5.9 %, due to the natural abundance of 35Cl (75.78 %) and 37Cl (24.22 %). Studies of cultures over 12 days of cultivation showed that maximum amounts of cacibiocins were reached after 10 days in CDM medium, with no further changes observed after that time (data not shown). Therefore, 11-day-old cultures were chosen for all further cacibiocin extractions. Total production was determined in CDM in Erlenmeyer flasks to be 2.4 mg LNone1 for cacibiocin A and 2.5 mg LNone1 for cacibiocin B. Separate extraction of pellet and supernatant showed that the major fraction of cacibiocin A and B was detected in the supernatant. Extraction of the aqueous culture supernatant, adjusted to pH 4, with ethyl acetate reproducibly yielded 90 % of the total cacibiocins. However, cacibiocin A and B produc-tion levels in CDM and eight other media (CDM, ISP medium 2, TSB medium, distillers solubles medium, simocyclinone fermen-tation medium, SSM medium, medium M, and SK medium; Table S1) were quite low. We therefore decided to heterolo-gously express the cacibiocin gene cluster in Streptomyces coe-licolor M1152, a strain optimized for the heterologous expres-sion of secondary metabolites.[25] This experiment would also facilitate the preparative isolation of sufficient amounts of caci-biocins for structure elucidation and, at the same time, could provide proof that the identified aminocoumarin biosynthetic gene cluster was indeed responsible and sufficient for biosyn-thesis of cacibiocins A and B. Figure 1. Construction of the heterologous expression cosmid caciJZ08 containing the whole cacibiocin biosynthetic gene cluster (see text for details). Cloning and heterologous expression of the cacibiocin biosynthetic gene cluster A SuperCos 1-based cosmid library containing 3000 clones was constructed from C. acidiphila DNA and screened with PCR pri-mers for genes situated within or adjacent to the identified gene cluster (see the Experimental Section). Two cosmids were identified (Figure 1): cosmid 1E1 contained the whole putative cacibiocin biosynthetic gene cluster, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions. Cosmid 10E2 contained only a part of the putative gene clus-ter, that is, the biosynthetic genes from cabH to cabR12, as well as genes downstream thereof. Cosmid 10E2 therefore lacked the C-terminal region of the halogenase cabhal, the two regulatory genes cabR7 and cabR8, and the putative transporter gene cabR5. Unexpectedly, attempts to heterologously ex-press cosmid 1E1 failed, due to an instability of this cosmid that was observed whenever the integration cassette from pIJ787[26] (containing the genes and the attP site required for integration into a Strepto-myces genome) was introduced into the bla se-quence of the cosmid backbone.[27] It remains unclear whether the size of the cosmid insert or a defect in the SuperCos 1 backbone caused this instability problem. Introduction of the integration cassette from pIJ787 into cosmid 10E2, in contrast, resulted in the stable construct 10E2int. As expected, however, heterologous expression of this construct in S. coeli-color M1152 did not result in cacibiocin formation, as parts of the biosynthetic gene cluster were missing. In order to generate a stable cosmid containing the complete cluster for heterologous expression, and in order to eliminate unnecessary flanking sequences adjacent to the cluster, we designed the two-step strategy depicted in Figure 1. In the first step, the genes from caci_2664 to caci_2706 were eliminated from 10E2int. This was achieved by replacing these genes using Red ET recombination with the apramycin resistance cassette from pIJ773,[28] resulting in cosmid caciJZ04. In the second step, a 14 kb restriction fragment was generated from cosmid 1E1 containing the genes from cabR7 to cabR9 and the bla resist-ance gene. This fragment was introduced into caciJZ04 by Red ET recombination, resulting in cosmid caciJZ07, which con-tained the complete cluster and a functional bla resistance gene. Reintroduction of the integration cassette from pIJ787 into the bla resistance gene by Red ET recombination finally re-sulted in the stable integrative cosmid caciJZ08. This was sub-sequently introduced by conjugation into the genome of S. coelicolor M1152.[25] Four independent integration mutants were selected for analysis. Strain S. coelicolor M1152 (caciJZ08)-4 showed the highest production level and was chosen for all subsequent studies. Cultivation in CDM medium resulted in the formation of cacibiocin A (10 mg LNone1) and cacibiocin B (0.7 mg LNone1). The identity of these compounds to those formed by the wild-type strain C. acidiphila was confirmed by HPLC and ESI-MS/MS. Improvement of production rates by a media screen To further improve the yield of cacibiocin A and B in the heter-ologous producer strain, as well as in the wild-type strain, 31 media (Table S1) were prepared and used for cultivation in 24-well deep-well plates.[29] Cacibiocin production was determined and compared to production in CDM medium.[24] Results are given in Figure 2 and Table S2. Cacibiocin production by the native producer C. acidiphila was observed only in three other media (SM14, SM20, and SM24). In two of these, production was significantly higher than in CDM, reaching a total yield of 7.5 mg LNone1. Notably, caci-biocin production by the heterologous producer was observed in 27 of the investigated media, with a maximum production of 60 mg LNone1 in SM27. In only four media, no production was observed. Most of the cacibiocin was produced in form of the non-halogenated cacibiocin A, whereas the di-halogenated cacibiocin B was produced in smaller amounts. As shown in Figure 2, the best production media for C. acidiphila (SM20 and ly formed cacibiocin A. After day 10, however, the amount of cacibiocin A decreased, with a concomitant increase in cacibio-cin B (Figure S2). This might indicate that cacibiocin A was taken up from the medium, halogenated to form cacibiocin B, and excreted again. In contrast, in C. acidiphila, cacibiocin B was the dominant product at all time points, indicating a very efficient halogenation system. Structure elucidation of cacibiocin A and B Preparative amounts of cacibiocin A were isolated from the heterologous producer strain S. coelicolor M1152 (caciJZ08)-4, and cacibiocin B was isolated from the native producer strain C. acidiphila. HPLC-MS analysis in negative mode showed the presence of molecular ions with m/z 329.0 [MNoneH]None for cacibio-cin A and m/z 396.9 [MNoneH]None for cacibiocin B. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) showed molecular ions with m/z 329.041527 [MNoneH]None (calcd 329.041524 for C15H9N2O7 [MNoneH]None ; D 0.009 ppm) for cacibiocin A and m/z 396.963791 [MNoneH]None (calcd 396.963580 for C15H7Cl2N2O7 [MNoneH]None ; D 0.53 ppm) for cacibiocin B. As mentioned before, the isotope pattern for cacibiocin B is characteristic of a di-chlorinated substance. ESI-HR-MS/MS analysis resulted in char-acteristic fragmentations of pyrrole and coumarin moieties for cacibiocin A (m/z 149.0354, 192.0313) and cacibiocin B (m/z 149.0359, 259.9535), respectively,[30] and clear assignment of the dichlorinated coumarin moiety of cacibiocin B due to the isotopic pattern (Figures 3 and S5). Unidimensional (1H, 13C) and multidimensional (1H,1H COSY, 1H,1H TOCSY1, HSQC1, HMBC1, NOESY) NMR studies resulted in 5-[(4,7-dihydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)carbamoyl]-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid for cacibiocin A (C15H10N2O7, MR = 330.25 g mol None1). The 2,5-sub-stitution pattern of the pyrrole moiety was determined via 1H NMR with 3-H (6.80 ppm, 3J = 2.9 Hz,4J = 2.1 Hz) and 4-H (6.91 ppm, 3J = 4J = 2.9 Hz) as a double doublet pattern in [D6]DMSO and with a strong vicinal coupling constant for 3-H and 4-H (3J = 4.0 Hz) in [D4]MeOH. NOESY experiments resulted in a strong signal between 4-H of the pyrrole and the proton of the 4\u2019-OH at the aminocoumarin moiety; this confirmed the 2,5-substitution of the pyrrole. Minimum energy calculations (DFT), including solvent effects in Gaussian 09, resulted in a dis-tance of 3.393 None for 4-H and 4\u2019-OH and are in accordance with the NOESY range. Other possible substitution patterns are not in accordance with the observed consistent 1H and 13C NMR signals and NOESY correlations. The 1H and 13C NMR spectro-scopic data of cacibiocin A and 1H,1H COSY, 1H HSQC, 1H HMBC, and NOESY correlations are given in the Supporting Informa-tion (Figure S3 and S4 and Table S3). NMR data for cacibiocin A and B show distinct differences between the coumarin signals, as expected (Figure S4). The chlorine substitution of cacibio-cin B was assigned to a 6\u2019,8\u2019-dichloro coumarin moiety via comparative 1H NMR and increment calculations. Cacibiocin B lacks the 1H NMR signals for protons 6\u2019 and 8\u2019 of cacibiocin A. However, it shows the same doublets for the protons of the pyrrole moiety (cf Figure S4), with the singlet for proton H-5\u2019 shifted +0.1 ppm. Hence, cacibiocin B was assigned as 5-[(6,8-dichloro-4,7-dihydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)carbamoyl]-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (C15H8Cl2N2O7, MR = 399.14 g mol None1). Figure 3. ESI\u2013high-resolution MS-MS fragmentation spectra. A) Cacibiocin A. B) Cacibiocin B, with expansion of the mass range from 258 to 264. Lack of gyrase-inhibitory and antibacterial activity of caci-biocin A and B Classical aminocoumarin antibiotics such as novobiocin (Scheme 1) are potent inhibitors of gyrase. The substituted de-oxysugar moiety of these compounds is essential for this activ-ity.[5] As mentioned in the introduction, simocyclinone D8 (Scheme 1) was unexpectedly also found to be a potent gyrase inhibitor, despite the lack of a deoxysugar moiety, and it acts via a different binding mechanism.[12] We tested cacibiocin A and B for gyrase inhibitory activity in DNA supercoiling assays with clorobiocin as a positive control.[4] Clorobiocin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus gyrase at concentrations of 0.5 mm, but no gyrase inhibition was exhibited by cacibiocin A or B, even at concentrations up to 50 mm (Figure S6). Antibacterial activity was tested in disc diffusion assays against the Gram-negative strains E. coli DH5a and E. coli DtolC and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Clorobiocin showed clear growth inhibition of E. coli DtolC and B. subtilis ATCC 6633 when 1 nmol was applied to the filter disc. In contrast, no antimicro-bial activity could be observed for cacibiocin A or B at amounts of 20 nmol and 50 nmol per disc, respectively (data not shown). Thus, cacibiocins did not act as gyrase inhibitors and did not show antimicrobial activity against the tested bacterial strains. Their role in the producing organism is still unclear. Discussion Aminocoumarins are a rare class of compounds in nature. Only five biosynthetic gene clusters for aminocoumarins have been identified thus far (for the five compounds depicted in Scheme 1), all within the genus Streptomyces. The cacibiocin cluster is the first one found outside of this genus. The cacibiocins comprise the same 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-coumarin moiety that is characteristic of other aminocoumar-ins, but they contain two interesting new structural features. First, the aminocoumarin moiety of cacibiocin B is chlorinated in two positions, that is, in positions 6\u2019 and 8\u2019 (Figure 3). Previ-ous structure\u2013activity relationship investigations have proven that the chlorine atom of clorobiocin (Scheme 1) contributes significantly to the very high activity of this antibiotic.[4, 31] Com-binatorial biosynthesis experiments with the halogenase gene clohal have enabled generation of chlorinated derivatives of novobiocin and coumermycin.[31, 32] The discovery of the halo-genase cabhal of cacibiocin B biosynthesis might open a route to the combinatorial biosynthesis of dichlorinated novobiocin, clorobiocin, coumermycin, and simocyclinone derivatives, in-creasing the chemical diversity of this class of gyrase inhibitors for drug development programs and potentially aiding the generation of compounds with increased antibiotic activity. The second new structural feature of the cacibiocins is the pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety. It is different from the cen-tral pyrrole moiety of coumermycin A1 (Scheme 1). This latter moiety was recently found to be derived from threonine under catalysis of the gene product of couR1, couR2a/b, couR3, and couR4.[33] This represented a new biosynthetic pathway to the pyrrole moiety, which has important functions in biomolecules and pharmaceuticals.[34] The structure of the pyrrole-2,5-dicar-boxylic acid moiety of the cacibiocins is not consistent with biosynthesis from threonine, and the cacibiocin cluster does not contain orthologues of the genes couR1\u2013couR4. Therefore, the cacibiocin cluster apparently contains the genes for a fur-ther, yet unknown biosynthetic pathway to the pyrrole moiety. Identification of these genes might open a route to the combi-natorial biosynthesis of new coumermycin derivatives, which is of interest as coumermycin is the most potent known amino-coumarin antibiotic.[4] The successful heterologous expression of the cacibiocin cluster proves that this gene cluster is indeed responsible for the formation of the cacibiocins, and that it contains all genes required for their biosynthesis. Based on the bioinformatic analysis of the genes contained in this cluster, we propose the hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for cacibiocin A and B de-picted in Scheme 2. The 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moi-ety is most likely formed by the gene products of cabHIYJK in the same way as in the novobiocin and clorobiocin biosynthet-ic pathways.[14a, 15] This moiety is then linked to the pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid under catalysis of the amide synthetase CabL, forming the intermediate cacibiocin A, which is subsequently chlorinated at positions 6\u2019and 8\u2019of the aminocoumarin moiety by the halogenase Cabhal. This is analogous to the halogena-tion step in clorobiocin biosynthesis.[14a] Formation of the pyr-role-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety occurs by a yet unknown bio-synthetic pathway. As this moiety lacks the 3-methyl group found in the central pyrrole moiety of coumermycin A1 (Scheme 1), its biosynthesis might start from serine or homo-serine rather than threonine and could involve the gene prod-ucts of cabR10, a putative pyroxidal-5\u2019-phosphate dependent protein, and cabR11, an FAD-dependent oxidoreductase. Notably, CabR5 shows high similarity to CouR5 (50 % amino acid identity), a putative transporter encoded by the coumer-mycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster. CouR5 has been suggested to be involved in self-resistance.[23] The expression of couR5 is likely to be controlled by regulator gene couR6, situated adja-cent to couR5 (in the opposite direction) and separated by a 137 bp intergenic region that probably contains a bidirectional promotor. The same arrangement is found in the cacibiocin cluster for the putative transporter gene cabR5 and the regula-tor gene cabR7 (Figure 1), which are separated by a 56 bp region. The genes cabR10, cabR11, and cabR12 appear to form an operon with the biosynthetic genes from cabH to cabL, where-as the genes cds1\u20136 are separated from this operon by two in-tergenic regions in front of cds1 and cds2. As mentioned in the results section, the cacibiocin gene cluster might comprise the 16.6 kb DNA region from cabR7 to cabR12. Whether or not cds1\u20136 are involved in the secondary metabolism remains un-clear. Cacibiocin A and B are relatively small molecules compared to other aminocoumarins (Scheme 1) and, in contrast to all other known aminocoumarins, they lack antibiotic activities. This raises the question as to whether they merely represent intermediates of a pathway that genuinely forms a more com-plex, biologically active compound.

We also searched the genome of C. acidiphila for homo-logues of genes that form additional structural motifs found in the other aminocoumarins depicted in Scheme 1. No gene cluster for the biosynthesis of a deoxysugar similar to that of other aminocoumarins, and no glycosyltransferase with close homology to the glycosyltransferases NovM, CloM, or CouM[14a] could be identified. We also were unable to find homologues of NovN, which forms the carbamoyl moiety attached to the deoxysugar of novobiocin, or homologues of CouN1\u20137, which are responsible for the formation and attachment of the termi-nal pyrrole moieties of coumermycin A1 (a similar pathway produces the pyrrole moiety of clorobiocin). As there is some structural similarity between the pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety of the cacibiocins and the 3,4-dihydroxydipicolinate (DHDP) moiety of rubradirin, we also searched for homologues of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) synthase, involved in the formation of the ansamacrolide moiety of rubradirin, but could find none in C. acidiphila. We were also unable to identi-fy genes for the formation of an angucyclinone moiety similar to that of simocyclinone. Therefore, neither experimental nor bioinformatics studies gave any indication that C. acidiphila forms aminocoumarins other than cacibiocin A and B. In the native producer strain, cacibiocin production did not exceed 7.5 mg LNone1. Production levels could be successfully raised to more than 60 mg LNone1 by heterologous expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster in S. coelicolor M1152. This dem-onstrates the value of heterologous expression in specifically engineered host strains as a key method in genome mining for the discovery of new secondary metabolites. An interesting finding is the striking difference in the optimal production media of the native producer C. acidiphila and the heterolo-gous producer S. coelicolor M1152 (caciJZ08) (Figure 2). When gene clusters are transferred to a het-erologous producer strain, an ex-tensive re-screening of optimal production media is apparently advisable in order to ensure op-timal production yields. The di-chlorination of the aminocou-marin moiety and presence of the pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety of cacibiocin are two striking new features not previ-ously known in aminocoumarins. Both features open new possibil-ities for combinatorial biosynthe-sis of aminocoumarins. Further-more, investigations of the for-mation of the novel pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety might reveal a new pathway to pyrroles in nature. Experimental Section Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S4. Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains were cultured in lysogeny broth at 37 8C and 200 rpm.[35] Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928 was cultured at 30 8C and 200 rpm, and all media were adjusted to pH 5.6[21] before inoculation. Precultures were grown for 2 days in YMG (50 mL, yeast extract 4 g LNone1, malt extract 10 g LNone1, glucose 4 g LNone1) in 300 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks con-taining a stainless steel spring. Production media were inoculated with preculture (5 %) and cultivated for 11 days. Streptomyces coeli-color M1152 strains were cultivated as described for C. acidiphila by using the proposed pH of the medium and supplementing with the appropriate antibiotics. Initial production studies were carried out in chemically defined medium (CDM) as described by Kominek et al.[24] A further 31 types of medium (SM1, SM3\u201310, SM12\u201331, R5A, and SV2) were prepared according to media recipes kindly provided by EntreChem SL/Oviedo (Table S1). Screening was performed in 24-well deep-well plates[29] under the same conditions as for cultiva-tion in flasks but with shaking at 300 rpm. Each well was cultivated with medium (3 mL) and supplemented with siloxylated ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer[29] (0.6 %). Triplicate measure-ments were performed for each medium and strain. Extraction, analysis, and purification of cacibiocin A and B : Extrac-tions of cultures were performed as described for clorobiocin.[ 1c] The cultures were acidified to pH 4 with HCl and extracted twice with equal volumes of EtOAc. Afterwards, the solvent was evapo-rated, and the dried extract was resuspended in MeOH for further analysis.[ 1c] Metabolites were analyzed by HPLC using a ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ column (5 mm, 250 None 4.6 mm) and a linear gradient from 30 to 100 % MeOH in 0.1 % aqueous formic acid over 31 min; the flow rate was 1 mL minNone1, with detection carried out at 320 nm. Scheme 2. Hypothetical biosynthetic pathway of cacibiocins A and B. For purification of cacibiocin A and B, 1 L of either S. coelicolor M1152 (caciJZ08) in SM12 medium or C. acidiphila DSM 44928 in CDM medium was extracted as described above. Dried extract was suspended in MeOH/CH3CN (1:1) containing formic acid (0.1 %) and eluted with the corresponding solvent in fractions over a LiChro-Prep DIOL (Merck) column (flow rate: 0.6 mL minNone1). Fractions (6 mL each) were collected and analyzed for cacibiocin content. Fractions containing cacibiocin A or B were pooled, and the sol-vent was evaporated. During evaporation, cacibiocins precipitated and could be removed by centrifugation. After washing once with ice-cold MeOH and once with ice-cold CH3CN, the cacibiocins were dried and dissolved in MeOH for LC-MS and in CD3OD or [D6]DMSO for NMR analysis. Structure elucidation of cacibiocin A and B : High resolution tandem mass spectrometry was performed by using an ESI-MS Bruker MaXis 4G TOF. Measurements for aminocoumarins were performed in negative ionization mode.[30] For data analysis, the software Bruker ESI Compass 1.3, DataAnalysis 4.0 SP 5 was used. FTICR-MS (ESI-HR-MS) were recorded on a Bruker Daltonik Apex IV. 1H and 13C NMR data were recorded on a Bruker Avance (at 400, 100 MHz) or Bruker AMX (at 600, 150.7 MHz). Chemical shifts are expressed in d values with the solvent as internal standard. Spectra analysis was performed with Mestrelab Research MestReNova 6.2.1\u20137569. For all analyses, cacibiocins were dissolved either in [D6]DMSO or MeOD. Agar diffusion tests and gyrase assay : Agar plates were prepared by inoculating LB agar with 3 % of fully grown culture (OD600 = 1.2) of either E. coli DH5a, E. coli DtolC, or B. subtilis ATCC 6633. Sterile paper discs (\u00d8 = 7 mm) were placed on the plates and supplied with MeOH (25 mL) containing different amounts of the respective antibiotic or secondary metabolite. A DNA gyrase supercoiling assay was performed as described by Alt et al.[4] DNA isolation and manipulation : Standard methods for isolation and manipulation of DNA were performed as described by Kieser et al.[36] Construction and screening of a cosmid library : Genomic DNA was partially digested with Bsp1431 at 0.1 U mgNone1 DNA for 3\u20135 min, de-phosphorylated, and then ligated into SuperCos 1 (Stratagene, Hei-delberg, Germany). The ligation products were packaged with Gig-apack III XL Packaging Extract (Stratagene) and transduced in E. coli SURE. A cosmid library of 3000 clones was screened with three primer pairs situated within or adjacent to the identified gene clus-ter: caci2698-F (5\u2019-AGAAC ACCGC TCCGA TCAGC-3\u2019) and caci2698-R (5\u2019-AGGCC TGCCT GAGCA ATTCC-3\u2019) ; caci2723-F (5\u2019-TAGGC CAGGT CGGTC ACAGA-3\u2019) and caci2723-R (5\u2019-AGCAC CTGGT CGAAG TCCTC-3\u2019) ; caci2727-F (5\u2019-ATCTT GGGCA CCAGC AGCAC-3\u2019) and caci2727-R (5\u2019-TAGCG GTAGC AGGTC ATCGA CG-3\u2019). Two cosmids were identified: 1E1, containing the whole cluster (CP001700, bases 3087901\u20133127663) and 10E2, containing a part of the cluster (CP001700, bases 3074836\u20133120624). Construction of cosmid caciJZ08 : The construction of caciJZ08 is de-picted in Figure 1. First, the genes downstream of caci_2707 in 10E2int (derived from 10E2 by introduction of the integration cas-sette from pIJ787[26]) were replaced by the apramycin resistance cassette from pIJ773[28b] using Red ET recombination[27, 28] and the primer pair 10E2-773-F2 (5\u2019-GTCCA TGCAG ACCAC TCTAA TCGCG GGGCG GATCG GCATT CTAGA ATTCC GGGGA TCCGT CGACC-3\u2019) and 10E2-773-R2 (5\u2019-TCAGA GTCCT TCCGA ATGGG TGGGT GTTGG TGGGC GATCA CTAGT TGTAG GCTGG AGCTGC TTC-3\u2019), resulting in cosmid caciJZ04. 1E1 was then digested with AseI and BsiWI to give a 14 kb fragment containing additional genes from the caci-biocin cluster. This fragment was purified by agarose gel extraction and subse-quently introduced into caciJZ04 by Red ET recombination, result-ing in cosmid caciJZ07. The integration cassette from pIJ787 con-taining an attP site[28a] was then introduced into caciJZ07 to yield caciJZ08. This cosmid was introduced into S. coelicolor M1152[25] by triparental conjugative transfer.

        "Introduction",
        "Aminocoumarin antibiotics are produced by Streptomyces strains and defined by their 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety. So far, five aminocoumarins: novobiocin, clorobiocin, coumermycin A1, simocyclinone D8, and rubradirin (Scheme 1), have been discovered, and their biosynthetic gene clusters have been published and investigated over the last two de-cades.[1] Novobiocin (Albamycin) was licensed in the USA in 1964 as an antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococ-cus aureus strains (MRSA),[2] but was withdrawn from sale by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 because of its side effects and the availability of better therapeutic agents. It is still widely used in veterinary medicine (Albadry, Biodry) for preventing mastitis of dairy cows.[3] Clorobiocin and coumer-mycin A1 are even more potent as antibacterial agents. [4]",
        "The three classical aminocoumarins novobiocin, clorobiocin, and coumermycin A1 are well-known as potent inhibitors of bacterial gyrase.[5] Bacterial DNA gyrases are among the best-investigated antibacterial targets.[6] They are heterotetrameric enzymes consisting of two GyrA and two GyrB subunits that catalyze the ATP-dependent negative supercoiling of DNA. The three classical aminocoumarins target the GyrB subunit, in con-trast to fluoroquinolones, which attack the GyrA subunit of bacterial gyrase. X-ray crystallographic analysis showed that both the aminocoumarin moiety and the substituted desoxy-sugar moiety (Scheme 1) are involved in binding to the GyrB subunit and, therefore, both moieties are essential for antibiot-ic activity.[7] More recently, novobiocin and its derivatives have also been identified as potent inhibitors of heat shock protein Hsp90[8] and, recently, as inhibitors of HIF1a and the p300/CBP interaction,[9] suggesting their potential as antitumor com-pounds and against protozoan infections such as trypanoso-miasis.[10] Simocyclinone D8 has no desoxysugar moiety at the 7-OH of the aminocoumarin moiety but was unexpectedly found to be a more powerful gyrase inhibitor than novobio-cin.[11] A completely new mechanism of gyrase inhibition was subsequently reported for simocyclinone D8,[12] in which it interacts with two separate pockets within the N-terminal domain of the GyrA subunit. Rubradirin is methylated at the 7-OH of the aminocoumarin ring and, in contrast to the previ-ously mentioned aminocoumarin antibiotics, exhibits antibac-terial activity by a distinct mechanism, inhibiting translation at the bacterial ribosomes.[13]",
        "Genome mining led to the discovery of a novel aminocoumar-in gene cluster in the rare actinomycete Catenulispora acidiphi-la DSM 44928. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of genes putatively involved in export/resistance, regulation, and biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin moiety and its halogena-tion, as well as several genes with so far unknown function. Two new aminocoumarins, cacibiocin A and B, were identified in the culture broth of C. acidiphila. Heterologous expression of the putative gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 confirmed that this cluster is responsible for cacibiocin biosyn-thesis. Furthermore, total production levels of cacibiocins could be increased by heterologous expression and screening of different culture media from an initial yield of 4.9 mg LNone1 in C. acidiphila to 60 mg LNone1 in S. coelicolor M1152. By HR-MS and NMR analysis, cacibiocin A was found to contain a 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety linked by an amide bond to a pyr-role-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. The latter structural motif has not been identified previously in any natural compound.

        "The aminocoumarin moiety is rare in nature and has only been reported in the five aminocoumarin antibiotics described above. All five biosynthetic gene clusters contain orthologues of the genes involved in the formation of the 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety, first described for novobiocin as novH, novI, novJ, and novK.[14] NovH activates tyrosine by ade-nylate formation and subsequent binding to a phosphopante-theinyl cofactor. The activated tyrosine is then hydroxylated at the b-position by NovI, a cytochrome P450 enzyme.[14b] The MbtH-like proteins CloY and SimY are strictly required for the activity of the NovH orthologues CloH and SimH, and they also stimulate NovH activity.[15] NovJ and NovK are involved in the oxidation of covalently enzyme-bound b-hydroxytyrosine to b-ketotyrosine.[16] The ring oxygen atom of the aminocoumarin moiety is derived from atmospheric oxygen,[17] suggesting that 2-hydroxylation takes place before lactonization. However, the final steps leading to the formation of the aminocoumarin moiety are still unknown. In the biosynthesis of all five amino-coumarins, an amide synthetase such as NovL links the 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety to an acyl moiety.[18] The aminocoumarin moiety can be further modified at position 8. In case of novobiocin or coumermycin A1, it is methylated by NovO or CouO, and in the case of clorobiocin and simocyclin-one D8, it is chlorinated by Clohal or SimC6.[14a]",
        "Recently, the identification of coumermycins from an actino-mycete strain of the genus Actinoallomurus was reported.[19] This was the first time aminocoumarins were described outside of the genus Streptomyces. The fast-growing number of bacte-rial genome sequences in the databases, including an increas-ing number of rare actinomycetes, offers a new chance to dis-cover aminocoumarins by genome mining. In this study, we describe the structure of two new aminocoumarins, cacibiocin A and B, which were identified by genome mining and heterol-ogous expression of a newly discovered aminocoumarin gene cluster from the rare actinomycete Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928.",
        "Results Identification of a new aminocoumarin gene cluster by genome mining and bioinformatic sequence analysis Screening of actinobacteria sequences deposited in the NCBI GenBank database, by using the tblastx algorithm, for genes with high similarity to the four aminocoumarin biosynthesis genes novH, novI, novJ, and novK led to the identification of a putative aminocoumarin gene cluster in the genome of Cate-nulispora acidiphila DSM 44928.[20] C. acidiphila has been stud-ied previously for the production of bioactive compounds,[21] but no aminocoumarins have been described. The identified gene cluster contains genes homologous to novH, novI, novJ, and novK, that is, caci_2723 (hereafter termed cabH), caci_2722 (cabI), caci_2720 (cabJ), and caci_2718 (cabK). In addition, caci_ 2721 (cabY) encodes an MbtH-like protein with high similarity to SimY and CloY from the simocyclinone and clorobiocin bio-synthetic gene clusters. However, the C terminus of CabY con-",

        "tains 30 additional amino acids, which is unusual in the super-family of MbtH-like proteins (Table 1). In between cabJ and cabK (see Figure 1), we found an additional coding sequence (CDS), caci_2719 (cabR9), coding for a 164 amino acid (aa) pro-tein with unknown function, for which no close homologues can be found in the NCBI databases. Gene caci_2717 (cabL), located downstream of cabK, codes for an amide synthetase with 58 % amino acid identity to CouL, which catalyzes the for-mation of the amide bond between the central pyrrole moiety and the aminocoumarin moieties in coumermycins.[22]",
        "All seven genes named above are transcribed in the same direction. It is possible that they form an operon together with the three adjacent genes: caci_2716 (cabR10), caci_2715 (cabR11), and caci_2714 (cabR12), as the predicted coding se-quences of cabL, cabR10, and cabR11 overlap, and the inter-genic region in front of cabR12 comprises only 6 bp. The genes cabR10 and cabR11 encode a putative pyroxidal-5\u2019-phos-phate-dependent protein and an FAD-dependent oxidoreduc-tase, whereas cabR12 encodes a putative Na+/H+ antiporter possibly involved in the export of cacibiocins.",
        "Six further CDSs situated downstream of cabR12 are tran-scribed in the same direction: hypothetical protein caci_2713 (cds1), calcium binding protein caci_2712 (cds2), DUF556 domain-containing protein caci_2711 (cds3), putative aldehyde dehydrogenase caci_2710 (cds4), putative alcohol dehydrogen-ase caci_2709 (cds5), and methyltransferase caci_2708 (cds6). It remains unclear whether these six genes are involved in secon-dary metabolism. Two putative promoters could be situated in the intergenic regions upstream of cds1 (78 bp) and cds2 (160 bp).",
        "On the other side of the cluster, upstream of cabH (see Figure 1), gene caci_2724 (cabhal) is transcribed in the oppo-site direction and encodes a halogenase with 72 % amino acid identity to SimC6 from the simocyclinone biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting that the identified cluster might be respon-sible for production of a chlorinated aminocoumarin. Down-stream of the halogenase cabhal, we identified two regulatory genes: caci_2725 (cabR8), belonging to the luxR-family, and caci_2727 (cabR7), belonging to the tetR-family, as well as gene caci_2726 (cabR5), which encodes a transporter with 50 % amino acid identity to CouR5 from the coumermycin A1 clus-ter.[23]",
        "We speculated that the borders of the identified aminocou-marin cluster might be represented by genes cabR7 and cabR12. However, it cannot be overlooked that the cluster also comprises cds1\u20136. Downstream of cabR7, the genes caci_2728 and caci_2729 encode two putative a-l-arabinofuranosidases, whereas on the other site of the cluster, downstream of cds6, the genes caci_2707 and caci_2706 encode two low-conserved hypothetical proteins, followed by the genes caci_2705 and caci_2704, encoding a putative heat shock protein Hsp18 tran-scriptional regulator and a putative heat shock protein Hsp20. These gene annotations are not suggestive of an involvement in secondary metabolism.",
        "Two new aminocoumarins produced by Catenulispora acidiphila To discover new possible aminocoumarins produced by C. acid-iphila, the bacteria were grown in a chemically defined medium (CDM) originally developed for novobiocin produc-tion,[24] extracted, and examined by HPLC and LC-MS. HPLC analysis yielded two product peaks with UV absorption spectra similar to that of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin, characterized by absorption maxima at 280 nm and 320 nm (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Using both parent ion scan MS and product ion scan MS, we could confirm that one of the two compounds, termed cacibiocin A, gave the ex-pected fragment for an unsubstituted dihydroxyaminocoumar-in moiety (m/z 192). The other compound, termed cacibiocin B, gave a fragment of m/z 260, consistent with a dichlorinated di-hydroxyaminocoumarin moiety. The molecular masses of caci-biocin A and cacibiocin B were determined to be 330 g molNone1 and 397.9 g molNone1. As expected, a clear pattern of a dichlorinat-ed compound was visible for cacibiocin B with three masses of",
        "Table 1. Identified coding sequences (cds) in the biosynthetic gene cluster of cacibiocin.",
        "397.9, 399.9, and 401.9 g molNone1 in a ratio of 57.4:36.7:5.9 %, due to the natural abundance of 35Cl (75.78 %) and 37Cl (24.22 %).",
        "Studies of cultures over 12 days of cultivation showed that maximum amounts of cacibiocins were reached after 10 days in CDM medium, with no further changes observed after that time (data not shown). Therefore, 11-day-old cultures were chosen for all further cacibiocin extractions. Total production was determined in CDM in Erlenmeyer flasks to be 2.4 mg LNone1 for cacibiocin A and 2.5 mg LNone1 for cacibiocin B.",
        "Separate extraction of pellet and supernatant showed that the major fraction of cacibiocin A and B was detected in the supernatant. Extraction of the aqueous culture supernatant, adjusted to pH 4, with ethyl acetate reproducibly yielded 90 % of the total cacibiocins. However, cacibiocin A and B produc-tion levels in CDM and eight other media (CDM, ISP medium 2, TSB medium, distillers solubles medium, simocyclinone fermen-tation medium, SSM medium, medium M, and SK medium; Table S1) were quite low. We therefore decided to heterolo-gously express the cacibiocin gene cluster in Streptomyces coe-licolor M1152, a strain optimized for the heterologous expres-sion of secondary metabolites.[25] This experiment would also facilitate the preparative isolation of sufficient amounts of caci-biocins for structure elucidation and, at the same time, could provide proof that the identified aminocoumarin biosynthetic gene cluster was indeed responsible and sufficient for biosyn-thesis of cacibiocins A and B.",
        "Figure 1. Construction of the heterologous expression cosmid caciJZ08 containing the whole cacibiocin biosynthetic gene cluster (see text for details).",
        "Cloning and heterologous expression of the cacibiocin biosynthetic gene cluster",
        "A SuperCos 1-based cosmid library containing 3000 clones was constructed from C. acidiphila DNA and screened with PCR pri-mers for genes situated within or adjacent to the identified gene cluster (see the Experimental Section). Two cosmids were identified (Figure 1): cosmid 1E1 contained the whole putative cacibiocin biosynthetic gene cluster, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions. Cosmid 10E2 contained only a part of the putative gene clus-ter, that is, the biosynthetic genes from cabH to cabR12, as well as genes downstream thereof. Cosmid 10E2 therefore lacked the C-terminal region of the halogenase cabhal, the two regulatory genes cabR7 and cabR8, and the putative transporter gene cabR5. Unexpectedly, attempts to heterologously ex-press cosmid 1E1 failed, due to an instability of this cosmid that was observed whenever the integration cassette from pIJ787[26] (containing the genes and the attP site required for integration into a Strepto-myces genome) was introduced into the bla se-quence of the cosmid backbone.[27] It remains unclear whether the size of the cosmid insert or a defect in the SuperCos 1 backbone caused this instability problem. Introduction of the integration cassette from pIJ787 into cosmid 10E2, in contrast, resulted in the stable construct 10E2int. As expected, however, heterologous expression of this construct in S. coeli-color M1152 did not result in cacibiocin formation, as parts of the biosynthetic gene cluster were missing. In order to generate a stable cosmid containing the complete cluster for heterologous expression, and in order to eliminate unnecessary flanking sequences adjacent to the cluster, we designed the two-step strategy depicted in Figure 1. In the first step, the genes from caci_2664 to caci_2706 were eliminated from 10E2int. This was achieved by replacing these genes using Red ET recombination with the apramycin resistance cassette from pIJ773,[28] resulting in cosmid caciJZ04. In the second step, a 14 kb restriction fragment was generated from cosmid 1E1 containing the genes from cabR7 to cabR9 and the bla resist-ance gene. This fragment was introduced into caciJZ04 by Red ET recombination, resulting in cosmid caciJZ07, which con-tained the complete cluster and a functional bla resistance gene. Reintroduction of the integration cassette from pIJ787 into the bla resistance gene by Red ET recombination finally re-sulted in the stable integrative cosmid caciJZ08. This was sub-sequently introduced by conjugation into the genome of S. coelicolor M1152.[25]",
        "Four independent integration mutants were selected for analysis. Strain S. coelicolor M1152 (caciJZ08)-4 showed the highest production level and was chosen for all subsequent studies. Cultivation in CDM medium resulted in the formation of cacibiocin A (10 mg LNone1) and cacibiocin B (0.7 mg LNone1). The identity of these compounds to those formed by the wild-type strain C. acidiphila was confirmed by HPLC and ESI-MS/MS. Improvement of production rates by a media screen",
        "To further improve the yield of cacibiocin A and B in the heter-ologous producer strain, as well as in the wild-type strain, 31 media (Table S1) were prepared and used for cultivation in 24-well deep-well plates.[29] Cacibiocin production was determined and compared to production in CDM medium.[24] Results are given in Figure 2 and Table S2.",
        "Cacibiocin production by the native producer C. acidiphila was observed only in three other media (SM14, SM20, and SM24). In two of these, production was significantly higher than in CDM, reaching a total yield of 7.5 mg LNone1. Notably, caci-biocin production by the heterologous producer was observed in 27 of the investigated media, with a maximum production of 60 mg LNone1 in SM27. In only four media, no production was observed. Most of the cacibiocin was produced in form of the non-halogenated cacibiocin A, whereas the di-halogenated cacibiocin B was produced in smaller amounts. As shown in Figure 2, the best production media for C. acidiphila (SM20 and",
        "ly formed cacibiocin A. After day 10, however, the amount of cacibiocin A decreased, with a concomitant increase in cacibio-cin B (Figure S2). This might indicate that cacibiocin A was taken up from the medium, halogenated to form cacibiocin B, and excreted again. In contrast, in C. acidiphila, cacibiocin B was the dominant product at all time points, indicating a very efficient halogenation system.",
        "Structure elucidation of cacibiocin A and B Preparative amounts of cacibiocin A were isolated from the heterologous producer strain S. coelicolor M1152 (caciJZ08)-4, and cacibiocin B was isolated from the native producer strain C. acidiphila. HPLC-MS analysis in negative mode showed the presence of molecular ions with m/z 329.0 [MNoneH]None for cacibio-cin A and m/z 396.9 [MNoneH]None for cacibiocin B. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) showed molecular ions with m/z 329.041527 [MNoneH]None (calcd 329.041524 for C15H9N2O7 [MNoneH]None ; D 0.009 ppm) for cacibiocin A and m/z 396.963791 [MNoneH]None (calcd 396.963580 for C15H7Cl2N2O7 [MNoneH]None ; D 0.53 ppm) for cacibiocin B. As mentioned before, the isotope pattern for cacibiocin B is characteristic of a di-chlorinated substance. ESI-HR-MS/MS analysis resulted in char-acteristic fragmentations of pyrrole and coumarin moieties for cacibiocin A (m/z 149.0354, 192.0313) and cacibiocin B (m/z 149.0359, 259.9535), respectively,[30] and clear assignment of the dichlorinated coumarin moiety of cacibiocin B due to the isotopic pattern (Figures 3 and S5). Unidimensional (1H, 13C) and multidimensional (1H,1H COSY, 1H,1H TOCSY1, HSQC1, HMBC1, NOESY) NMR studies resulted in 5-[(4,7-dihydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)carbamoyl]-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid for cacibiocin A (C15H10N2O7, MR = 330.25 g mol None1). The 2,5-sub-stitution pattern of the pyrrole moiety was determined via 1H NMR with 3-H (6.80 ppm, 3J = 2.9 Hz,4J = 2.1 Hz) and 4-H (6.91 ppm, 3J = 4J = 2.9 Hz) as a double doublet pattern in [D6]DMSO and with a strong vicinal coupling constant for 3-H and 4-H (3J = 4.0 Hz) in [D4]MeOH. NOESY experiments resulted in a strong signal between 4-H of the pyrrole and the proton of the 4\u2019-OH at the aminocoumarin moiety; this confirmed the 2,5-substitution of the pyrrole. Minimum energy calculations (DFT), including solvent effects in Gaussian 09, resulted in a dis-tance of 3.393 None for 4-H and 4\u2019-OH and are in accordance with the NOESY range. Other possible substitution patterns are not in accordance with the observed consistent 1H and 13C NMR signals and NOESY correlations. The 1H and 13C NMR spectro-scopic data of cacibiocin A and 1H,1H COSY, 1H HSQC, 1H HMBC, and NOESY correlations are given in the Supporting Informa-tion (Figure S3 and S4 and Table S3). NMR data for cacibiocin A and B show distinct differences between the coumarin signals, as expected (Figure S4). The chlorine substitution of cacibio-cin B was assigned to a 6\u2019,8\u2019-dichloro coumarin moiety via comparative 1H NMR and increment calculations. Cacibiocin B lacks the 1H NMR signals for protons 6\u2019 and 8\u2019 of cacibiocin A. However, it shows the same doublets for the protons of the pyrrole moiety (cf Figure S4), with the singlet for proton H-5\u2019 shifted +0.1 ppm. Hence, cacibiocin B was assigned as 5-[(6,8-dichloro-4,7-dihydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)carbamoyl]-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (C15H8Cl2N2O7, MR = 399.14 g mol None1).",

        "Lack of gyrase-inhibitory and antibacterial activity of caci-biocin A and B",
        "Classical aminocoumarin antibiotics such as novobiocin (Scheme 1) are potent inhibitors of gyrase. The substituted de-oxysugar moiety of these compounds is essential for this activ-ity.[5] As mentioned in the introduction, simocyclinone D8 (Scheme 1) was unexpectedly also found to be a potent gyrase inhibitor, despite the lack of a deoxysugar moiety, and it acts via a different binding mechanism.[12] We tested cacibiocin A and B for gyrase inhibitory activity in DNA supercoiling assays with clorobiocin as a positive control.[4] Clorobiocin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus gyrase at concentrations of 0.5 mm, but no gyrase inhibition was exhibited by cacibiocin A or B, even at concentrations up to 50 mm (Figure S6). Antibacterial activity was tested in disc diffusion assays against the Gram-negative strains E. coli DH5a and E. coli DtolC and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Clorobiocin showed clear growth inhibition of E. coli DtolC and B. subtilis ATCC 6633 when 1 nmol was applied to the filter disc. In contrast, no antimicro-bial activity could be observed for cacibiocin A or B at amounts of 20 nmol and 50 nmol per disc, respectively (data not shown). Thus, cacibiocins did not act as gyrase inhibitors and did not show antimicrobial activity against the tested bacterial strains. Their role in the producing organism is still unclear.",
        "Discussion Aminocoumarins are a rare class of compounds in nature. Only five biosynthetic gene clusters for aminocoumarins have been identified thus far (for the five compounds depicted in Scheme 1), all within the genus Streptomyces. The cacibiocin cluster is the first one found outside of this genus.",
        "The cacibiocins comprise the same 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-coumarin moiety that is characteristic of other aminocoumar-ins, but they contain two interesting new structural features. First, the aminocoumarin moiety of cacibiocin B is chlorinated in two positions, that is, in positions 6\u2019 and 8\u2019 (Figure 3). Previ-ous structure\u2013activity relationship investigations have proven that the chlorine atom of clorobiocin (Scheme 1) contributes significantly to the very high activity of this antibiotic.[4, 31] Com-binatorial biosynthesis experiments with the halogenase gene clohal have enabled generation of chlorinated derivatives of novobiocin and coumermycin.[31, 32] The discovery of the halo-genase cabhal of cacibiocin B biosynthesis might open a route to the combinatorial biosynthesis of dichlorinated novobiocin, clorobiocin, coumermycin, and simocyclinone derivatives, in-creasing the chemical diversity of this class of gyrase inhibitors for drug development programs and potentially aiding the generation of compounds with increased antibiotic activity.",
        "The second new structural feature of the cacibiocins is the pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety. It is different from the cen-tral pyrrole moiety of coumermycin A1 (Scheme 1). This latter moiety was recently found to be derived from threonine under catalysis of the gene product of couR1, couR2a/b, couR3, and couR4.[33] This represented a new biosynthetic pathway to the pyrrole moiety, which has important functions in biomolecules and pharmaceuticals.[34] The structure of the pyrrole-2,5-dicar-boxylic acid moiety of the cacibiocins is not consistent with biosynthesis from threonine, and the cacibiocin cluster does not contain orthologues of the genes couR1\u2013couR4. Therefore, the cacibiocin cluster apparently contains the genes for a fur-ther, yet unknown biosynthetic pathway to the pyrrole moiety. Identification of these genes might open a route to the combi-natorial biosynthesis of new coumermycin derivatives, which is of interest as coumermycin is the most potent known amino-coumarin antibiotic.[4]",
        "The successful heterologous expression of the cacibiocin cluster proves that this gene cluster is indeed responsible for the formation of the cacibiocins, and that it contains all genes required for their biosynthesis. Based on the bioinformatic analysis of the genes contained in this cluster, we propose the hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for cacibiocin A and B de-picted in Scheme 2. The 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moi-ety is most likely formed by the gene products of cabHIYJK in the same way as in the novobiocin and clorobiocin biosynthet-ic pathways.[14a, 15] This moiety is then linked to the pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid under catalysis of the amide synthetase CabL, forming the intermediate cacibiocin A, which is subsequently chlorinated at positions 6\u2019and 8\u2019of the aminocoumarin moiety by the halogenase Cabhal. This is analogous to the halogena-tion step in clorobiocin biosynthesis.[14a] Formation of the pyr-role-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety occurs by a yet unknown bio-synthetic pathway. As this moiety lacks the 3-methyl group found in the central pyrrole moiety of coumermycin A1 (Scheme 1), its biosynthesis might start from serine or homo-serine rather than threonine and could involve the gene prod-ucts of cabR10, a putative pyroxidal-5\u2019-phosphate dependent protein, and cabR11, an FAD-dependent oxidoreductase.",
        "Notably, CabR5 shows high similarity to CouR5 (50 % amino acid identity), a putative transporter encoded by the coumer-mycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster. CouR5 has been suggested to be involved in self-resistance.[23] The expression of couR5 is likely to be controlled by regulator gene couR6, situated adja-cent to couR5 (in the opposite direction) and separated by a 137 bp intergenic region that probably contains a bidirectional promotor. The same arrangement is found in the cacibiocin cluster for the putative transporter gene cabR5 and the regula-tor gene cabR7 (Figure 1), which are separated by a 56 bp region.",
        "The genes cabR10, cabR11, and cabR12 appear to form an operon with the biosynthetic genes from cabH to cabL, where-as the genes cds1\u20136 are separated from this operon by two in-tergenic regions in front of cds1 and cds2. As mentioned in the results section, the cacibiocin gene cluster might comprise the 16.6 kb DNA region from cabR7 to cabR12. Whether or not cds1\u20136 are involved in the secondary metabolism remains un-clear.",
        "Cacibiocin A and B are relatively small molecules compared to other aminocoumarins (Scheme 1) and, in contrast to all other known aminocoumarins, they lack antibiotic activities. This raises the question as to whether they merely represent intermediates of a pathway that genuinely forms a more com-plex, biologically active compound. As depicted in Figure 2, we",

        "We also searched the genome of C. acidiphila for homo-logues of genes that form additional structural motifs found in the other aminocoumarins depicted in Scheme 1. No gene cluster for the biosynthesis of a deoxysugar similar to that of other aminocoumarins, and no glycosyltransferase with close homology to the glycosyltransferases NovM, CloM, or CouM[14a] could be identified. We also were unable to find homologues of NovN, which forms the carbamoyl moiety attached to the deoxysugar of novobiocin, or homologues of CouN1\u20137, which are responsible for the formation and attachment of the termi-nal pyrrole moieties of coumermycin A1 (a similar pathway produces the pyrrole moiety of clorobiocin). As there is some structural similarity between the pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety of the cacibiocins and the 3,4-dihydroxydipicolinate (DHDP) moiety of rubradirin, we also searched for homologues of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) synthase, involved in the formation of the ansamacrolide moiety of rubradirin, but could find none in C. acidiphila. We were also unable to identi-fy genes for the formation of an angucyclinone moiety similar to that of simocyclinone. Therefore, neither experimental nor bioinformatics studies gave any indication that C. acidiphila forms aminocoumarins other than cacibiocin A and B.",
        "In the native producer strain, cacibiocin production did not exceed 7.5 mg LNone1. Production levels could be successfully raised to more than 60 mg LNone1 by heterologous expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster in S. coelicolor M1152. This dem-onstrates the value of heterologous expression in specifically engineered host strains as a key method in genome mining for the discovery of new secondary metabolites. An interesting finding is the striking difference in the optimal production media of the native producer C. acidiphila and the heterolo-gous",
        "producer S. coelicolor M1152 (caciJZ08) (Figure 2). When gene clusters are transferred to a het-erologous producer strain, an ex-tensive re-screening of optimal production media is apparently advisable in order to ensure op-timal production yields. The di-chlorination of the aminocou-marin moiety and presence of the pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety of cacibiocin are two striking new features not previ-ously known in aminocoumarins. Both features open new possibil-ities for combinatorial biosynthe-sis of aminocoumarins. Further-more, investigations of the for-mation of the novel pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid moiety might",
        "reveal a new pathway to pyrroles in nature.",
        "Experimental Section Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S4. Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains were cultured in lysogeny broth at 37 8C and 200 rpm.[35] Catenulispora acidiphila DSM 44928 was cultured at 30 8C and 200 rpm, and all media were adjusted to pH 5.6[21] before inoculation. Precultures were grown for 2 days in YMG (50 mL, yeast extract 4 g LNone1, malt extract 10 g LNone1, glucose 4 g LNone1) in 300 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks con-taining a stainless steel spring. Production media were inoculated with preculture (5 %) and cultivated for 11 days. Streptomyces coeli-color M1152 strains were cultivated as described for C. acidiphila by using the proposed pH of the medium and supplementing with the appropriate antibiotics. Initial production studies were carried out in chemically defined medium (CDM) as described by Kominek et al.[24] A further 31 types of medium (SM1, SM3\u201310, SM12\u201331, R5A, and SV2) were prepared according to media recipes kindly provided by EntreChem SL/Oviedo (Table S1). Screening was performed in 24-well deep-well plates[29] under the same conditions as for cultiva-tion in flasks but with shaking at 300 rpm. Each well was cultivated with medium (3 mL) and supplemented with siloxylated ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer[29] (0.6 %). Triplicate measure-ments were performed for each medium and strain. Extraction, analysis, and purification of cacibiocin A and B : Extrac-tions of cultures were performed as described for clorobiocin.[ 1c] The cultures were acidified to pH 4 with HCl and extracted twice with equal volumes of EtOAc. Afterwards, the solvent was evapo-rated, and the dried extract was resuspended in MeOH for further analysis.[ 1c] Metabolites were analyzed by HPLC using a ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ column (5 mm, 250 None 4.6 mm) and a linear gradient from 30 to 100 % MeOH in 0.1 % aqueous formic acid over 31 min; the flow rate was 1 mL minNone1, with detection carried out at 320 nm.",
        "Scheme 2. Hypothetical biosynthetic pathway of cacibiocins A and B.",
        "For purification of cacibiocin A and B, 1 L of either S. coelicolor M1152 (caciJZ08) in SM12 medium or C. acidiphila DSM 44928 in CDM medium was extracted as described above. Dried extract was suspended in MeOH/CH3CN (1:1) containing formic acid (0.1 %) and eluted with the corresponding solvent in fractions over a LiChro-Prep DIOL (Merck) column (flow rate: 0.6 mL minNone1). Fractions (6 mL each) were collected and analyzed for cacibiocin content. Fractions containing cacibiocin A or B were pooled, and the sol-vent was evaporated. During evaporation, cacibiocins precipitated and could be removed by centrifugation. After washing once with ice-cold MeOH and once with ice-cold CH3CN, the cacibiocins were dried and dissolved in MeOH for LC-MS and in CD3OD or [D6]DMSO for NMR analysis. Structure elucidation of cacibiocin A and B : High resolution tandem mass spectrometry was performed by using an ESI-MS Bruker MaXis 4G TOF. Measurements for aminocoumarins were performed in negative ionization mode.[30] For data analysis, the software Bruker ESI Compass 1.3, DataAnalysis 4.0 SP 5 was used. FTICR-MS (ESI-HR-MS) were recorded on a Bruker Daltonik Apex IV. 1H and 13C NMR data were recorded on a Bruker Avance (at 400, 100 MHz) or Bruker AMX (at 600, 150.7 MHz). Chemical shifts are expressed in d values with the solvent as internal standard. Spectra analysis was performed with Mestrelab Research MestReNova 6.2.1\u20137569. For all analyses, cacibiocins were dissolved either in [D6]DMSO or MeOD. Agar diffusion tests and gyrase assay : Agar plates were prepared by inoculating LB agar with 3 % of fully grown culture (OD600 = 1.2) of either E. coli DH5a, E. coli DtolC, or B. subtilis ATCC 6633. Sterile paper discs (\u00d8 = 7 mm) were placed on the plates and supplied with MeOH (25 mL) containing different amounts of the respective antibiotic or secondary metabolite. A DNA gyrase supercoiling assay was performed as described by Alt et al.[4] DNA isolation and manipulation : Standard methods for isolation and manipulation of DNA were performed as described by Kieser et al.[36] Construction and screening of a cosmid library : Genomic DNA was partially digested with Bsp1431 at 0.1 U mgNone1 DNA for 3\u20135 min, de-phosphorylated, and then ligated into SuperCos 1 (Stratagene, Hei-delberg, Germany). The ligation products were packaged with Gig-apack III XL Packaging Extract (Stratagene) and transduced in E. coli SURE. A cosmid library of 3000 clones was screened with three primer pairs situated within or adjacent to the identified gene clus-ter: caci2698-F (5\u2019-AGAAC ACCGC TCCGA TCAGC-3\u2019) and caci2698-R (5\u2019-AGGCC TGCCT GAGCA ATTCC-3\u2019) ; caci2723-F (5\u2019-TAGGC CAGGT CGGTC ACAGA-3\u2019) and caci2723-R (5\u2019-AGCAC CTGGT CGAAG TCCTC-3\u2019) ; caci2727-F (5\u2019-ATCTT GGGCA CCAGC AGCAC-3\u2019) and caci2727-R (5\u2019-TAGCG GTAGC AGGTC ATCGA CG-3\u2019). Two cosmids were identified: 1E1, containing the whole cluster (CP001700, bases 3087901\u20133127663) and 10E2, containing a part of the cluster (CP001700, bases 3074836\u20133120624). Construction of cosmid caciJZ08 : The construction of caciJZ08 is de-picted in Figure 1. First, the genes downstream of caci_2707 in 10E2int (derived from 10E2 by introduction of the integration cas-sette from pIJ787[26]) were replaced by the apramycin resistance cassette from pIJ773[28b] using Red ET recombination[27, 28] and the primer pair 10E2-773-F2 (5\u2019-GTCCA TGCAG ACCAC TCTAA TCGCG GGGCG GATCG GCATT CTAGA ATTCC GGGGA TCCGT CGACC-3\u2019) and 10E2-773-R2 (5\u2019-TCAGA GTCCT TCCGA ATGGG TGGGT GTTGG TGGGC GATCA CTAGT TGTAG GCTGG AGCTGC TTC-3\u2019), resulting in cosmid caciJZ04. 1E1 was then digested with AseI and BsiWI to give a 14 kb fragment containing additional genes from the caci-biocin cluster. This fragment was purified by agarose gel extraction and subse-quently introduced into caciJZ04 by Red ET recombination, result-ing in cosmid caciJZ07. The integration cassette from pIJ787 con-taining an attP site[28a] was then introduced into caciJZ07 to yield caciJZ08. This cosmid was introduced into S. coelicolor M1152[25] by triparental conjugative transfer. The abbreviations used are: ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; FTICR-MS, Four-ier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; HR-MS, high resolution mass spectrometry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coher-ence; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; TOCSY, total correlated spectroscopy",
