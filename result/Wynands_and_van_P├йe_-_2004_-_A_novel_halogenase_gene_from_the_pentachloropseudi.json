ATCC 33002. The halogenase has high identity (55%) to the flavin-dependent monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin-3 halogenase from pyrrol-nitrin biosynthesis and to the halogenases PltM and PltA (35% and 28%, respectively) involved in pyoluteorin biosynthesis. The enzyme has no sequence similarity to the flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases. The gene could be heterologously expressed in Pseudomonas aureofaciens ACN as soluble protein. Chlorinating activity of HalB was shown with two synthetic substrates with structural similarity to pentachloropseudilin. HalB is the first halogenase from an actinomycete and only the third halogenase for which halogenating activity could be demonstrated in vitro.

Introduction Halogenated metabolites can be found very frequently in nature [1]. While brominated compounds are predom-inantly produced by marine organisms, a large number of chlorinated metabolites can be found in organisms of terrestrial origin. Many of these halogenated metabo-lites possess antibiotic activity. Until 1995, haloperoxidases were thought to be the type of halogenating enzyme involved in the biosynthe-ses of halogenated metabolites. However, this view changed when during the cloning of the chlorotetracy-cline biosynthetic gene cluster [2] and the elucidation 0378-1097/$22.00 None 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies doi:10.1016/j.femsle.2004.06.053 * Corresponding author.

E-mail address: karl-heinz.vanpee@chemie.tu-dresden.de (K.-H. van Pe\u0301e). of the biosynthetic pathway of the antifungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin a novel type of halogenating enzymes could be detected [3,4]. The two halogenating enzymes involved in pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis, tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA) and monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin 3-halogenase (PrnC), require FADH2, chloride ions, and molecular oxygen for halogenating activity [5]. Genes for such FADH2-dependent halogenases have in the meantime been detected in many bacterial biosyn-thetic gene clusters for chlorinated metabolites [6]. How-ever, only in the case of the two halogenases involved in pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis, PrnA and PrnC, halogenating activity has been demonstrated in vitro [4,5]. The strain Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 33002 produces the phenylpyrrole derivative pentachloropseudilin (Fig. 1) which was detected by Cavalleri et al. in 1978 [7]. Until now, only very few data on the biosynthetic path-way of pentachloropseudilin are available [8]. . Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Fig. 1. Chemical structures of pentachloropseudilin, the two synthetic compounds used as substrates, pyrrolnitrin, and pyoluteorin. 364 I. Wynands, K.-H. van Pe\u0301e / FEMS Microbiology Letters 237 (2004) 363\u2013367 Pentachloropseudilin contains chlorine atoms in the phenol ring as well as in the pyrrole ring and it is not known whether the incorporation of the five chlorine at-oms is catalyzed by a single halogenase or by several en-zymes. Because of its structural similarity to pyrrolnitrin (Fig. 1), we used the halogenase genes prnA and prnC [3,9] from the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic gene cluster as probes to detect halogenase genes in the pentachloropse-udilin producer Actinoplanes sp. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditions Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 33002 was cultured in soy-bean flour-glucose medium [10] at 28 NoneC for 3 days. E. coli was cultured in Luria\u2013Broth (LB medium) [11] or HNB medium (3 g meat extract, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g peptone from meat, 5 g NaCl per litre) at 37 NoneC for 6\u2013 12 h. Pseudomonas aureofaciens and P. fluorescens were cultured at 30 NoneC in HNB medium for one day in genetic experiments and in MMM medium (25 g molasses, 2.1 g corn meal, 10 g malt extract, 30 g sucrose, 10 g yeast ex-tract, 2 g K2HPO4 per litre, pH 7.0) for 3 days in expres-sion experiments. In conjugation experiments PMM agar plates [12] were used. Antibiotics were added as fol-lows: ampicillin 100 lg mlNone1, apramycin 100 lg mlNone1, chloramphenicol 34 lg mlNone1, tetracycline 15 lg mlNone1 for E. coli and 30 lg mlNone1 for Pseudomonas. 2.2. DNA manipulation, Southern blot analysis, cloning and sequencing of the halogenase gene Total DNA was isolated using \u2018\u20182\u00b7 Kirby mix\u2019\u2019 as de-scribed by Hopwood et al. [13]. Plasmids were routinely isolated from E. coli and Pseudomonas strains by an al-kaline lysis method [11]. Conjugation from E. coli S17-1 into Pseudomonas was performed according to the pro-tocol described by Hill et al. [14]. The DNA probes used were the prnC gene from P. fluorescens BL915 [3] and a 296-bp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product which was amplified using the two PCR primers CHLST1+ (5 0-GCGGCTGCAGSTGGDWSATYCCGYT-3 0) and CHLST1-(5 0-CCSSTGGATCCSCGGGTCSABGAAG-C-3 0) derived from consensus sequences of known ha-logenases [6] and synthesized by MWG Biotech GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany. DNA probes were labelled with digoxygenin (Roche Diagnostic, Mannheim, Germany). A cosmid library was constructed using the cosmid vector pOJ446 [15] and the Gigapack III Gold Packag-ing Extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). The library was screened using the 296-bp PCR-product. For sequence analysis, overlapping fragments were subcloned from the cosmid pIW3000Bcos10 into the vector pBluescript SK+ and sequenced with standard primers (MWG Biotech GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). The nucleotide sequence data for halB have been depos-ited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence database under the Accession No. AF450451. 2.3. Heterologous expression of halB and enzyme assay For construction of the E. coli expression plasmid pRSEThalB, halB was amplified by PCR (forward primer 5 0-TATAAGATCTATGAGTTCAGCGCC-3 0, reverse primer 5 0-TATAAAGCTTTCAGAAGATCC-TCC-3 0) and ligated into the BglII/HindIII sites of pRSETB. For construction of the expression plasmid pCIBhalB, halB was amplified by PCR (forward primer 50-CAACTCTAGAAGGAGGCAGTCATGA-30, reverse primer 5 0-TATAAAGCTTTCAGAAGATCC-TCC-3 0) and ligated into the XbaI/HindIII sites of pPEH14 [9]. Amplification of a DNA fragment containing the His6 tag, Xpress antibody epitope, enterokinase recognition site and halB from the plasmid pRSEThalB (forward Fig. 2.

For expression of halB in E. coli, the strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS was used. The recombinant strain E. coli pLys pRSEThalB was grown in LB medium at 37 NoneC to an OD600nm between 0.4 and 0.6, induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 2 mM and further incubated at 30 NoneC. After harvesting the cells by centrifugation and resuspension in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), cells were disrupted by grinding with glass beads using a mixer-mill. For expression of halB and halBhis in Pseudomonads, the strains P. aureofaciens ACN [16] and P. fluorescens BL915 [14] were used. Bac-teria were harvested by centrifugation after 3 days of growth, resuspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and disrupted by sonication. Crude cell extracts and the pellets were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE [17] and Western blot analysis using the Anti-Xpress-HPR antibody (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Nether-lands) to detect the Xpress antibody epitope contained in HalBhis. The enzyme assay mixture contained 2.5 mM NADH, 12.5 lM FAD, 6.25 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM 2-(3,5-dibromo-2-methoxyphenyl)pyrrole or 2-(3,5-di-bromophenyl)pyrrole as the organic substrates, and 200 ll of crude cell extract in a total volume of 800 ll. The assays were incubated at 30 NoneC for 16 h with shak-ing. After extraction for three times with 400 ll methyl-tert-butyl ether and concentration in vacuo, the extracts were analyzed by GC\u2013MS with a GC Hewlett\u2013Packard 5890, MSD 5971 and HP G1034C MS ChemSation soft-ware. The column used was an HP-1 column with a length of 11.5 m, an inner diameter of 0.21 mm and a film thickness of 0.33 lm. The injector temperature was 260 NoneC and the detector temperature was 290 NoneC. The oven program started at 80 NoneC for 1 min, heated to 310 NoneC with a rate of 20 NoneC minNone1 and the final tem-perature was held for 3 min. As carrier gas helium was used with a flow rate of 1 ml minNone1. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Hybridisation experiments, screening of the cosmid library and analysis of the positive clone In Southern hybridisation experiment, using prnC as the probe hybridizing fragments could be detected (Fig. 2). However, no hybridisation signals could be foundwhen prnAwas used as the probe. This is consistent with the finding that FADH2-dependent halogenases can be divided into two groups according to their substrate specificity, with one group acting on tryptophan or indole derivatives as substrates and the other group catalysing the halogenation of pyrrole or phenol derivatives [6]. Screening of the cosmid library by colony hybridisa-tion with the 296-bp PCR product as the probe resulted in the detection of four positive cosmid clones. The clone containing the cosmid pIWcos10 was further ana-lyzed. Subcloning of a 3.7-kb SacI fragment into pUC18 and sequencing of the insert showed that this fragment contained a potential halogenase gene which was named halB. 3.2. Deduced protein sequence of HalB Translation of the nucleotide sequences of halB into the corresponding amino acid sequence and comparison with the halogenating enzymes PrnC [3] and Cts4 [2] showed a high degree of identity of 44% and 51%, re-spectively. Whereas regions of high similarity can be found in the central part, the similarity at the end of the enzyme is rather low. A highly conserved motif GxGxxG which is known to be involved in the binding of nucleotide cofactors [18] is located near the N-termi-nus. In the central part of the enzyme, a second abso-lutely conserved motif containing two tryptophan residues (WxWxI) could be identified. Interestingly, both motifs are incomplete in PltD which has a sequence identity of 33% to PrnC and which is involved in pyolu-teorin biosynthesis [19]. However, the function of PltD in pyoluteorin biosynthesis is not that of a halogenase, since the two halogen atoms present in pyoluteorin (Fig. 1) are incorporated by PltA and PltM. This shows that the overall sequence similarity is not a sufficient cri-terion for the annotation of halogenases, but that the two motifs (GxGxxG and WxWxI) are also essential cri-teria for the identification of FADH2-dependent halog-enases. The overall identity between the new halogenase HalB and other known halogenases from 366 I. Wynands, K.-H. van Pe\u0301e / FEMS Microbiology Letters 237 (2004) 363\u2013367 the biosynthetic gene clusters of halogenated metabo-lites range between 28% for PltA from pyoluteorin bio-synthesis [19] and 51% for Cts4 from chlorotetracycline biosynthesis [2] after correction of a sequencing error in the cts4 gene [3,19]. 3.3. Heterologous expression of halB in E. coli and in Pseudomonas strains and enzyme assay Expression experiments of halB in E. coli resulted in the formation of insoluble protein. HalB was overex-pressed as soluble protein in P. aureofaciens ACN from the expression plasmid pCIBhalB (Fig. 3(a)). Using the expression plasmid pCIBhalBhis which additionally contains the 6\u00b7His tag and the Xpress antibody epitope from the vector pRSETB overexpression of halB in P. fluorescens (Fig. 3(a)) could be proved by immunologi-cal detection of the Xpress antibody epitope (Fig. 3(b)). The enzyme assays were carried out with crude cell extracts from P. aureofaciens ACN pCIBhalB and P. flu-orescens BL915 pCIBhalBhis. Since flavin reductases are present in crude extracts [5] flavin reductase was not Fig. 3.

As controls, crude cell extracts of the host strains P. aureofaciens ACN andP. fluorescens BL915 were analysed for chlorinating activity. These controls did not show any halogenating activity with the substrates used. Halogenating activity was detected with the crude cell extract of P. aureofaciens ACN pCIBhalB with 2-(3,5-dibromo-2-methoxyphenyl)pyrrole (Fig. 1) as the substrate. The mass of the parent peak of the substrate (m/z 329/331/333, relative intensity 1:2:1) was shifted by m/z 34 in the parent peak of the product (m/z 363/365/ 367/369; relative intensity 3:7:5:1). This mass shift and the pattern of the parent peak obtained by GC\u2013MS clearly showed that the obtained product contained an additional chlorine atom. However, the chlorinating ac-tivity of HalB with this substrate was very low. A much higher chlorinating activity for HalB was found when 2-(3,5-dibromophenyl)pyrrole (Fig. 1; m/z 299/301/303, relative intensity 1:2:1) was used as the substrate (Fig. 4). Again an additional chlorine atom was incorpo-rated into the substrate with production of a compound with a mass shift of m/z 34 (m/z 333/335/337/339, relative intensity 3:7:5:1). No halogenating activity was detected xtracts from P. fluorescens BL915 (lanes a1 and b1), P. fluorescens ofaciens pCIBhalB (lane a4), molecular wheight marker (lane M). relative intensity 1:2:1) used as the substrate in the enzyme assay with as chloro-2-(3,5-dibromophenyl)pyrrole (m/z 333/335/337/339, relative I.

The low ac-tivity of HalB is most likely due to the fact that both substrates are not the natural substrates for HalB. How-ever, whereas for none of the many halogenase genes de-tected so far expression of the gene could be demonstrated, with the exception of prnA and prnC, chlorinating activity for HalB could be clearly shown. The very slow progress in the field of enzymatic haloge-nation is certainly mostly due to the fact that the recently detected FADH2-dependent halogenase have high substrate specificity and that their natural sub-strates are not known or are not available. This is also due for HalB. However, the chlorinating activity of HalB with the substrates used in this study is much too low to allow their use in the purification and charac-terisation of the enzyme. This will have to await the identification of the natural substrate. However, the fact that the two substrates which have quite some structural similarity to pentachloropseudilin (Fig. 1) are chlorinated by HalB, indicates that HalB could be involved in pentachloropseudilin biosynthesis and that at least one of the chlorination steps might oc-cur quite late in the biosynthetic pathway. However, to prove this, identification of the complete pentachlor-opseudilin biosynthetic gene cluster is necessary. Acknowledgements We thank Dr. S.

        "In Southern hybridisation experiment, using prnC as the probe hybridizing fragments could be detected (Fig. 2). However, no hybridisation signals could be foundwhen prnAwas used as the probe. This is consistent with the finding that FADH2-dependent halogenases can be divided into two groups according to their substrate specificity, with one group acting on tryptophan or indole derivatives as substrates and the other group catalysing the halogenation of pyrrole or phenol derivatives [6].",
        "Screening of the cosmid library by colony hybridisa-tion with the 296-bp PCR product as the probe resulted in the detection of four positive cosmid clones. The clone containing the cosmid pIWcos10 was further ana-lyzed. Subcloning of a 3.7-kb SacI fragment into pUC18 and sequencing of the insert showed that this fragment contained a potential halogenase gene which was named halB.",
        "3.2. Deduced protein sequence of HalB",
        "Translation of the nucleotide sequences of halB into the corresponding amino acid sequence and comparison with the halogenating enzymes PrnC [3] and Cts4 [2] showed a high degree of identity of 44% and 51%, re-spectively. Whereas regions of high similarity can be found in the central part, the similarity at the end of the enzyme is rather low. A highly conserved motif GxGxxG which is known to be involved in the binding of nucleotide cofactors [18] is located near the N-termi-nus. In the central part of the enzyme, a second abso-lutely conserved motif containing two tryptophan residues (WxWxI) could be identified. Interestingly, both motifs are incomplete in PltD which has a sequence identity of 33% to PrnC and which is involved in pyolu-teorin biosynthesis [19]. However, the function of PltD in pyoluteorin biosynthesis is not that of a halogenase, since the two halogen atoms present in pyoluteorin (Fig. 1) are incorporated by PltA and PltM. This shows that the overall sequence similarity is not a sufficient cri-terion for the annotation of halogenases, but that the two motifs (GxGxxG and WxWxI) are also essential cri-teria for the identification of FADH2-dependent halog-enases. The overall identity between the new halogenase HalB and other known halogenases from",

        "added. As controls, crude cell extracts of the host strains P. aureofaciens ACN andP. fluorescens BL915 were analysed for chlorinating activity. These controls did not show any halogenating activity with the substrates used. Halogenating activity was detected with the crude cell extract of P. aureofaciens ACN pCIBhalB with 2-(3,5-dibromo-2-methoxyphenyl)pyrrole (Fig. 1) as the substrate. The mass of the parent peak of the substrate (m/z 329/331/333, relative intensity 1:2:1) was shifted by m/z 34 in the parent peak of the product (m/z 363/365/ 367/369; relative intensity 3:7:5:1). This mass shift and the pattern of the parent peak obtained by GC\u2013MS clearly showed that the obtained product contained an additional chlorine atom. However, the chlorinating ac-tivity of HalB with this substrate was very low. A much higher chlorinating activity for HalB was found when 2-(3,5-dibromophenyl)pyrrole (Fig. 1; m/z 299/301/303, relative intensity 1:2:1) was used as the substrate (Fig. 4). Again an additional chlorine atom was incorpo-rated into the substrate with production of a compound with a mass shift of m/z 34 (m/z 333/335/337/339, relative intensity 3:7:5:1).

        "in the crude cell extract of P. fluorescens BL915 pCIB-halBhis with both substrates, indicating that the His tag might lead to not correctly folded HalB. The low ac-tivity of HalB is most likely due to the fact that both substrates are not the natural substrates for HalB. How-ever, whereas for none of the many halogenase genes de-tected so far expression of the gene could be demonstrated, with the exception of prnA and prnC, chlorinating activity for HalB could be clearly shown. The very slow progress in the field of enzymatic haloge-nation is certainly mostly due to the fact that the recently detected FADH2-dependent halogenase have high substrate specificity and that their natural sub-strates are not known or are not available. This is also due for HalB. However, the chlorinating activity of HalB with the substrates used in this study is much too low to allow their use in the purification and charac-terisation of the enzyme. This will have to await the identification of the natural substrate.",
        "However, the fact that the two substrates which have quite some structural similarity to pentachloropseudilin (Fig. 1) are chlorinated by HalB, indicates that HalB could be involved in pentachloropseudilin biosynthesis and that at least one of the chlorination steps might oc-cur quite late in the biosynthetic pathway. However, to prove this, identification of the complete pentachlor-opseudilin biosynthetic gene cluster is necessary.",
