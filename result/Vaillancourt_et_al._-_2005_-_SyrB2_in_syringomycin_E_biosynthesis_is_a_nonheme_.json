Walsh* Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115 Contributed by Christopher T. Walsh, May 27, 2005 The nine-residue lipodepsipeptide syringomycin E, elaborated as a phytotoxin by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301D contains a 4-Cl-L-Thr-9 moiety where failure to chlorinate results in a 3-fold drop in biological activity. The proteins SyrB1 and SyrB2 encoded by the biosynthetic cluster are shown to act as a substrate and enzyme pair for SyrB2-mediated chlorination of the aminoacyl-S-enzyme L-Thr-S-SyrB1. SyrB2 is a member of the nonheme FeII None-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme superfamily, and requires O2 and None-ketoglutarate as well as chloride ion to carry out monochlo-rination of the -CH3 group of L-Thr-S-SyrB1. Chlorination of L-Thr-S-SyrB1 was validated by thioesterase-mediated release of L-Thr and 4-Cl-L-Thr, N-derivatization as fluorescent isoindoles, and HPLC separation compared with authentic standards. Incubations with L-[14C]Thr and [36ClNone] as well as MS of the released products further validated identification. Enzymatic oxidative halogenation is a previously uncharacterized reaction type for nonheme FeII en-zymes and may be the general mode for biosynthetic halogenation of aliphatic carbons of natural products. natural product biosynthesis None enzymology None organohalogen A large variety of natural products from both terrestrial andmarine microorganisms contain covalently attached halo-gen substituents, predominantly chlorine or bromine (1). These products include chlorinated nonribosomal peptides such as the vancomycin and teicoplanin family of glycopeptides (2) and aromatic polyketides such as chlorotetracycline (3). Most of the organochlorine linkages are in aromatic or het-eroaromatic rings, such as the 3-Cl-None-OH-Tyr of the glyco-peptides, the chloro substituent in the aminocoumarin antibi-otics (2\u20134), and the 4,5-dichloropyrrole in pyoluteorin (5) (Fig. 1A). There are also aliphatic carbons bearing one, two, or three chlorine atoms in natural products, such as the 4-Cl-L-Thr at residue nine of the peptide scaffold of the phytotoxic syrin-gomycin E from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301D (6), the dichlorinated None-hydroxy acid of lyngbyabellin A (7), and the trichloroleucine-derived moiety in barbamide (8) (Fig. 1B). Both the aliphatic and aromatic C-Cl linkages are generated enzymatically. The timing and mechanism for covalent incorporation of chlo-rine into these diverse groups of natural products has been unclear, but two lines of information have clarified some of the molecular logic of enzymatic halogenation. The first line has come largely from the isolation and characterization of regioselective tryptophan halogenases from the pyrrolnitrin pathway (9, 10), the rebeccamy-cin pathway (11), and the pyrroindomycin B pathway (12). This type of halogenase was shown to have a requirement for FADH2 and O2 as cofactors (9, 11). More recently, we have characterized a pyrrole-dichlorinating flavoprotein PltA in the pyoluteorin pathway (P. C. Dorrestein, E. Yeh, S. Garneau, N. L. Kelleher, and C.T.W., unpublished data). Microbial genome sequencing has turned up homologous 50-kDa ORFs with FAD signature binding sites as predicted halogenases in the biosynthetic gene clusters for several nonribosomal peptide and polyketide halogenated metabolites. The general view now is that aromatic and heteroaromatic ring halogenations are effected by such flavoprotein halogenases, al-though both mechanistic understanding of the active chlorinating species and timing of halogenation relative to peptide chain elon-gation is still rudimentary. Halogenation at aliphatic carbon centers of amino acid constit-uents of nonribosomal peptides appears to use different enzymatic machinery. For example, neither the barbamide synthetase assem-bly line gene cluster nor the syringomycin synthetase cluster (6, 8) contain obvious flavoprotein halogenase homologs. Instead, they have ORFs predicted to be nonheme FeII, None-ketoglutarate (None-KG)-requiring enzymes. In this study, we have purified the SyrB1 and SyrB2 components of the syringomycin synthetase from P. syringae (6) in active form. We demonstrate that L-Thr, tethered in thioester linkage to the peptidyl carrier protein domain of SyrB1, is chlori-nated to 4-Cl-L-Thr-S-SyrB1 by the purified FeII-containing SyrB2 enzyme in the presence of O2, None-KG, and chloride ions, providing direct evidence of aliphatic halogenase activity for a nonheme FeII enzyme. Materials and Methods Chemicals. L-[14C]Thr [175 mCiNonemmol (1 Ci None 37 GBq)] and [36Cl]NaCl (16 mCiNoneg Cl) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. None-[1-14C]Ketoglutaric acid, sodium salt (54.5 mCiNone mmol), and [32P]pyrophosphate were from PerkinElmer. Throm-bin was from Novagen. 4-Cl-L-Thr was synthesized by following the method of Webb and Mathews (13). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Strains, Media, and Growth. Escherichia coli Top10 (Invitrogen) was used for DNA propagation. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen), transformed with derivatives of pET28b (Novagen), was used for overexpression in LB medium, supplemented with a potassium phosphate buffer described for Terrific Broth (14). An HCl-solubilized solution of minerals (15) was added for overexpression of the SyrB2 protein. Plasmid pJZ514 (16) containing the syrB1 and syrB2 genes was a gift from Dennis C. Gross (Texas A & M University, College Station, TX). Construction of Plasmids and Overexpression of Proteins. DNA was purified, manipulated, and transformed according to standard protocols (14). The syrB1 and syrB2 genes were amplified from the pJZ514 plasmid. The oligo pairs used for PCR amplification are the following: oSyrB1-for-NdeI 5None-GGAATTCCATATGCCGAT-TACGAACACT-3None; oSyrB1rev-EcoRI 5None-CGGAATTCAT-CAATGGGCTTGAACAAG-3None and oSyrB2for-NdeI 5None-GGA-ATTCCATATGAGCAAAAAATTCGCC-3None oSyrB2rev-EcoRI 5None-CGGAATTCATCAGACCGCTTCGAATTT-3None. PCR reac-tions were performed by using the PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The resulting amplicons were digested with NdeI and EcoRI and cloned into pET28b (Novagen), yielding the different expression plasmids. The cloned DNA was sequenced to confirm that it contained no errors. Abbreviation: None-KG, None-ketoglutarate. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

His-tagged Syr proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with their respective plasmids. Two-liter cul-tures were inoculated with 20 ml of an overnight culture grown at 37\u00b0C. The cultures were incubated for 9 h at 25\u00b0C, then cooled to 15\u00b0C for 1 h before the addition of isopropyl-None-D-thiogalactopyr-anoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The cultures were incubated for another 16\u201317 h, then harvested. Protein Purification. For SyrB1, a cell pellet from 6 liters of culture was resuspended in buffer A [20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 8.0None300 mM NaClNone5 mM imidazole]. The cells were disrupted by two successive passages through a French press operated at 12,500 psi (1 psi None 6.89 kPa) and 4\u00b0C. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 None g for 30 min. The supernatant was carefully removed. This \u2018\u2018raw extract\u2019\u2019 was incubated with 4 ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Qiagen) for 1 h and poured in a low-pressure chromatography column (1.5-cm diameter; Bio-Rad). The resin was washed succes-sively with 5 column volumes of buffer A and 4 column volumes of buffer B [20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 8.0None300 mM NaClNone30 mM imidazole] to remove nonspe-cifically bound contaminants. SyrB1 was eluted by using buffer C [20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid pH 8.0None100 mM NaClNone200 mM imidazole]. The eluate was concen-trated by using Amicon Ultra centrifugal devices (Millipore) and immediately applied to a 26None60 Superdex 200 column (GE Health-care) equilibrated with buffer D (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5). The protein fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid N2 in 10\u2013100-NoneL aliquots, and stored at None80\u00b0C until further use. For SyrB2, all cell-free preparations were manipulated under an inert atmosphere by using an Mbraun Labmaster glove box (Stratham, NH) maintained at 2 ppm O2 or less. Chromatography was performed by using an A\u0308KTA Explorer 100 (GE Healthcare) configured to maintain an anaerobic atmosphere during purifica-tion, as described in ref. 15. Buffers were sparged with Argon and equilibrated in the glove box for 24 h before use. A cell pellet from 6 liters of culture was resuspended and subjected to the French press as described for SyrB1. The broken cells were then sparged with argon for 20 min before transfer in gas-tight tubes in the glove box and centrifugation at 27,000 None g for 30 min. The Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column was performed as described for SyrB1 except that it was performed in the glove box. The Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid eluate was concentrated by using Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells (Millipore) under N2 pressure. SyrB2 was exchanged into buffer E (20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid pH 8.0None80 mM NaCl) by a series of concentrations and dilutions in the ultrafiltration cell. Two-millimolar CaCl2 was added, and the solution was incubated for 3 h at 19\u00b0C with thrombin (1 units:10 mg, thrombin:SyrB2). The protein solution was then diluted 1:1 with buffer F (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0) and loaded onto a MonoQ 10None100GL column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer F (multiple runs were performed). SyrB2 was eluted by using a NaCl gradient of 150\u2013300 mM over 15 column volumes at a flow rate of 4 mlNonemin. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected and checked for purity by SDS polyacrylamide gels. SyrB2 eluted at None230 mM NaCl. The fractions were pooled, concentrated, and injected on a 26None60 Superdex 75 column equilibrated in buffer D. SyrB2 eluted as a monomer. The fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid N2 in 50\u2013100-Nonel aliquots, and stored at None80\u00b0C until further use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (17). Metal Analysis. The metal content of SyrB2 was investigated by using inductively coupled plasma MS performed by Phytronix Technologies (Quebec). In reconstitution experiments, iron concentrations were determined colorimetrically by using FERENE S (18). In Vitro Reconstitution of SyrB2. Apo-SyrB2 was reconstituted anaer-obically by using two different approaches. In the first approach, SyrB2 was incubated with 1 mM DTTNone0.75 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 for 30 min before desalting on a Bio-Gel P6DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) to remove DTT and excess iron. In the second approach, SyrB2 was incubated with 1 mM DTTNone0.75 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2None2 mM None-KG for 30 min before desalting on a Bio-Gel P6DG column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5None2 mM None-KG. ATP-[32P]PPi Exchange Assay of the A Domain of SyrB1. The ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assay was performed as described in ref. 19 except that 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) was used and no Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added. Priming and Self-Loading Assay of SyrB1. The thiolation domain of SyrB1 was posttranslationally modified with the phosphopanteth-einyl group by using the purified Sfp protein (20). For the self-loading assay, SDS polyacrylamide gels of reactions performed in the presence and absence of ATP were done before autoradiog-raphy. [14C]Methylated protein standards (GE Healthcare) were coloaded with the broad range standards (Bio-Rad) in the molec-ular weight standards lanes. SyrB2 Activity Assays. The reaction catalyzed by SyrB2 was inves-tigated by incubating the enzyme with loaded SyrB1. Loaded SyrB1 was prepared by incubating holo-SyrB1 (100 NoneM) with 2.5 mM L-[14C]Thr (20 CiNonemol) or 2.5 mM L-Thr and 2.5 mM ATP for 60 min, followed by incubation with 2 mM None-KG and SyrB2 (6.5 NoneM) for 60 min. Chloride (2.5 mM) was present in the reaction mixture. The resulting reactions were transferred to 0.5 ml Ultrafree cen-Fig. 1. Structures of chlorine-containing natural products.

Excess amino acids were removed by using four wash steps with 0.5 ml of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. The resulting protein solution was incubated with 5 NoneM of the TycF type II thioesterase (21) to release the loaded amino acids. The amino acids were separated from the proteins by centrifuging the filter devices. The amino acids were then derivatized by using None-phthalaldehyde and 3-mercapto-propionate as described in amino acid analysis (22) and analyzed by using HPLC on a Beckman System Gold HPLC equipped with a Beckman 171 radioisotope detector or a Jasco FP-2020 fluores-cence detector (NoneexcitationNoneNoneemission, 340 nmNone450 nm) and compared with authentic standards. The activity of SyrB2 was also investigated on L-Thr and L-Thr-S-N-acetylcysteamine (23) at substrate con-centrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 mM with None-KG, oxygen, and MgCl2 present. None-KG and Fe Dependency of the SyrB2 Reaction. The None-KG depen-dency of the SyrB2 reaction was investigated by using the Fe-reconstituted form of SyrB2 in the absence of None-KG. The reaction was performed with L-[14C]Thr-S-SyrB1 as described in the previ-ous section with 15 NoneM SyrB2 in the absence and presence of 2 mM None-KG. For assessing the Fe dependency of the SyrB2 reaction, the apoprotein (14 NoneM) supplemented with 2 mM None-KG was used in incubations. Oxygen Dependency of the SyrB2 Reaction. The oxygen dependency of the SyrB2 reaction was investigated by preparing L-Thr-S-SyrB1 as previously described. L-Thr-S-SyrB1 was brought into the glove box and desalted on a BioGel P6-DG desalting column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. The fractions containing proteins were pooled and divided in 4 aliquots. Two millimolar None-KG, 1 mM NaCl and 2.6 NoneM SyrB2 were added to each tube. Two of the tubes were brought out of the box and exposed to air; the other two tubes remained in the glove box for a 60-min incubation. The aerobic and anaerobic reactions were then quenched with the addition of 2 mM 1,10-phenanthroline. Chloride Dependency of the SyrB2 Reaction. The chloride depen-dency of the SyrB2 reaction was investigated by using two methods: radio-HPLC and SDS polyacrylamide gels autoradiography by using [36Cl]NaCl. In the first approach, 0.5 ml of 100 NoneM L-Thr-S-SyrB1 was incubated with 1.5 mM None-KG, 8 mM [36Cl]NaCl (16 mCiNoneg Cl), and 14 NoneM SyrB2 and exposed to air for 60 min. In the second approach, 100 NoneM L-Thr-S-SyrB1 and 100 NoneM holo-SyrB1 were brought into the glove box and desalted on a BioGel P6DG desalting column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. The fractions containing proteins were pooled and incubated with 2 mM None-KG, 35 mM [36Cl]NaCl (16 mCiNoneg Cl), and 15 NoneM SyrB2. A control experiment in which L-Thr-S-SyrB1 was incubated with None-KG and [36Cl]NaCl, but no SyrB2 was also performed. The reaction mixtures were incubated in air for 60 min before gel loading and autoradiography. [14C]Methylated protein standards (GE Healthcare) were coloaded with the broad range standards (Bio-Rad) in the molecular weight standards lanes. Monitoring of the SyrB2 Reaction by Using None-[1-14C]KG. The con-sumption of None-KG by SyrB2 was monitored by following the loss of radioactivity in reactions performed with None-[1-14C]KG. Reactions were performed with 100 NoneM L-Thr-S-SyrB1, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM None-[1-14C]KG (18 mCiNonemmol), and 7 NoneM SyrB2 for 1 h. The remaining radioactivity was monitored by using liquid scintillation counting and used to calculate the number of turnovers performed by SyrB2 before inactivation. Control reactions were performed by omitting L-Thr-S-SyrB1 or SyrB2 in the mixture. Liquid Chromatography (LC)-MS Analysis. The masses of the released L-Thr and 4-Cl-L-Thr from SyrB1 by using TycF were monitored after derivatization with None-phthalaldehyde and 3-mercaptopropi-onate. Three hundred-microliter reactions of 100 NoneM SyrB1 were performed with or without SyrB2. The amino acids were hydro-lyzed as previously described and analyzed by LC-MS (positive mode). Results Expression and Purification of SyrB1 and SyrB2. The syrB1 and syrB2 genes from the P. syringae syringomycin biosynthetic cluster were expressed in E. coli as His-tagged fusions and purified as soluble proteins, with yields of 30 mg for SyrB1 and 10\u201312 mg for SyrB2 per liter of bacterial culture. SDS polyacrylamide gels indicated None95% and 99% purity, respectively. Because we anticipated SyrB2 would be an oxygen-labile FeII enzyme, the crude extract was immediately kept under N2 gas and transferred to an anaerobic glove box for purification and storage. The purified SyrB2 was an apoprotein and the His-tag was removed by proteolytic cleavage and chromatography to yield an enzyme that was then subjected to anaerobic reconstitution with FeII. In the absence of added None-KG, SyrB2 had 0.3\u20130.4 equivalents of bound FeII after anaerobic gel filtration. When None-KG was included in the reconstitution mixture, SyrB2 contained 0.85 to 0.95 equivalents of Fig. 2. L-Thr activation and self-loading reaction catalyzed by SyrB1.

FeII after gel filtration, consistent with the prediction it is an None-KG-and FeII-requiring enzyme. Characterization of SyrB1 Activity. SyrB1 is a 66-kDa didomain protein, consisting of an adenylation (A) domain and a thiolation (T) domain. Previous studies had indicated it could activate L-Thr (6) and led to the conclusion that SyrB1 selects and activates Thr-9 in the syringomycin backbone. For our purposes, we wanted to confirm that SyrB1 would show selectivity for L-Thr over 4-Cl-L-Thr as would be anticipated if chlorination occurred after covalent loading and formation of L-Thr-S-SyrB1. The first half-reaction of the A domain, reversible formation of L-Thr-AMP, was followed by amino acid-dependent exchange of [32PPi] into ATP. In the pres-ence of 5 mM amino acid, the relative rates were obtained as follows: L-Thr (100 None 3.6%), L-Ser (3.1 None 0.1%), 4-Cl-L-Thr (1.14 None 0.01%), D-Thr (1.01 None 0.01%), L-Ile (0.40 None 0.01%), L-Leu (0.33 None 0.01%), and D-Ser (0.24 None 0.04%). All other proteinogenic L-amino acids were tested and showed a rate of 0.25% or less when compared with L-Thr. The high specificity of SyrB1 for L-Thr was confirmed by a 60-fold selectivity in the apparent kinetic parame-ters for L-Thr (Km None 3.1 None 0.2 mM; kcat None 29.1 None 0.9 minNone1; kcatNone Km None 9.4 None 0.4 mMNone1minNone1) vs. L-Ser (Km None 7.7 None 0.5 mM; kcat None 1.23 None 0.05 minNone1; kcatNoneKm None 0.161 None 0.006 mMNone1minNone1). Most notably, SyrB1 shows low ability to activate 4-Cl-L-Thr, consistent with chlorination downstream of amino acid activation. The second half-reaction of SyrB1 should be the transfer of the activated threonyl moiety in L-Thr-AMP to the phosphopanteth-einyl moiety on the T domain (Fig. 2A). The holo form (phospho-pantetheinylated) of the T domain was generated posttranslation-ally in situ through action of Sfp (20) on purified SyrB1. Autoaminoacylation of holo SyrB1 in an ATP-dependent manner is then demonstrated by the autoradiogram in Fig. 2B with L-[14C]-Fig. 3. Formation of 4-Cl-L-Thr by SyrB2.

This L-Thr-S-SyrB1 enzyme thioester was used as the substrate for SyrB2. Chlorination Activity of SyrB2. To evaluate the activity of SyrB2, the enzyme was removed from anaerobic storage just before incuba-tions and added to L-Thr-S-SyrB1. In the presence of the three cosubstrates (O2, None-KG, and chloride ions), halogenation activity was observed. Given that the amino acid is covalently tethered to the T domain of SyrB1, detection of product involved the release of the aminoacyl moieties by enzymatic treatment with a thioes-terase, TycF. The amount of 4-Cl-L-Thr product is, at best, stoi-chiometric with the amount of SyrB1 (10 nmol) present in the incubations as protein substrate. To facilitate detection, the amino acids were derivatized with None-phthalaldehyde and 3-mercaptopro-pionate to yield the highly fluorescent isoindole derivatives (22). As shown in Fig. 3A, the enzymatic incubation with SyrB2 gave both L-[14C]-Thr substrate-derived isoindole and 4-Cl-L-[14C]Thr prod-uct-derived isoindole. Product formation depended on SyrB2. In addition to the radio-HPLC cochromatography with authentic isoindole standards (Fig. 3A), the SyrB1NoneB2 incubations were scaled up with nonradioactive L-Thr as substrate and subjected to MS to confirm identification. As noted in Fig. 3B, peak 1 from the HPLC of the enzymatic reaction workup gave the L-Thr-derived isoindole while peak 2 had the mass of the 4-Cl-L-Thr adduct, containing the isotopic signature of a chlorine atom. Validation of the dependence of SyrB2 on the three small molecule cosubstrates is shown in Fig. 4 A and B. In the absence of None-KG (trace c of Fig. 4A), there is no chlorination. Likewise, in trace b of Fig. 4B, the dependence on O2 as cosubstrate is demonstrated. Incorporation of [36ClNone] is shown in trace a of Fig. 4A. Additionally, it was possible to demonstrate incorporation of radioactive chloride ion into the SyrB1 protein by using SDS polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4C) that depends on the presence of L-Thr, interpreted as formation of [36Cl]-L-Thr-S-SyrB1. In studies not shown, we demonstrated that SyrB2 would not chlorinate free L-Thr or the small molecule surrogate for L-Thr-S-SyrB1, L-Thr-S-N-acetylcysteamine (23). Many nonheme FeII enzymes that use O2 and None-KG catalyze their own autooxidative destruction after a small number of turn-overs, presumably due to the decomposition of high-valent oxoiron species (24). SyrB2 was similarly labile. By monitoring the con-sumption of None-[1-14C]KG, SyrB2 was shown to catalyze 7 None 2 turnovers before inactivation. Kinetic analysis of the chlorination reaction remains to be undertaken, given the difficulties in deter-mining the conversion of a 66-kDa aminoacyl-S-protein substrate to a chloro-aminoacyl-S-protein product. Discussion This study demonstrates that SyrB2 is a nonheme FeII-containing enzyme that has a previously uncharacterized cata-lytic activity, the ability to halogenate an aliphatic methyl group on a protein-bound threonyl thioester. In the course of this initial work, we repeated the earlier demonstration that SyrB1 acti-vated L-Thr and proved in addition that it would install the threonyl moiety on its thiolation domain. This reaction was enabled by in vitro phosphopantetheinylation of SyrB1 to convert it from the apo form to the holo form of the T domain, able to engage in aminoacyl-S-T domain formation. In turn, this L-Thr-S-SyrB1 constitutes the substrate for SyrB2. SyrB2 is thus a tailoring enzyme working in trans on the threonyl group presented by the SyrB1 T domain scaffold. Our anaerobic purification and reconstitution of SyrB2 with FeII was designed to minimize any untoward oxidative damage of the active site from adventitious uncoupled reaction with O2. The successful reconsti-tution with FeII validated bioinformatics predictions that SyrB2 would be an FeII enzyme. Further, the increase to full stoichiometry of FeII reconstitution in the presence of None-KG indicated that None-KG is a stabilizing ligand for FeII, as noted for other enzymes in this enzyme superfamily (24). The previously described members of the None-KG-dependent nonheme FeII enzymes bind None-KG as a ligand to iron. After decarboxylation in the presence of cosubstrate O2, succinate and CO2 are generated together with a high-valent FeIVAO oxoiron species, which is a potent oxidizing and hydroxylating species toward bound substrate (25). Indeed, assays of SyrB2 show a comparable requirement for both O2 and None-KG for catalytic turnover. The product outcome, however, is divergent. SyrB2 chlorinates but does not detectably hydroxylate L-Thr-S-SyrB1. The incorporation of chloride into the threonyl scaffold was validated by cochromatography of the released product as the isoindole deriv-ative, incorporation of radioactive [36ClNone], and MS with the signa-ture isotopic doublet for a monochlorinated compound. Mechanistic studies remain for this transformation, but the proposed pathway in Fig. 5 is likely. As with other O2 cleaving, None-KG-decarboxylating enzymes, one can find conserved histidines Fig. 5. Proposed mechanism of halogenation catalyzed by SyrB2 involving formation of the FeIVAO intermediate characteristic of this enzyme class but its diversion for chlorination rather than hydroxylation.

The formation of the FeIVAO ferryl species is likely to be a common intermediate in both the oxygenase and halogenase mechanism. The high-valent oxoiron species can break unactivated C-H bonds in substrates homolytically to produce the substrate radical and an FeIII-OH as donor of an OHNone by radical rebound to complete hydroxylation (24, 25, 28). We anticipate that there will be a chloride ion bound to the FeIV intermediate of the SyrB2 active site. After C-H homolysis at carbon 4 of the threonyl moiety of L-Thr-S-SyrB1, there could be a competition between transfer of OHNone or ClNone to the threonyl CH2None. Because no hydroxylation is detected (data not shown), we assume an orientation favoring ClNone transfer. A favored reactivity toward chlorination could also be due to the lower potential of ClNone vs. OHNone (29). This proposed enzyme chemistry has precedent in two model systems where transfers of metal-coordinated ClNone have been for-mulated: chromyl chloride-mediated chlorination of cyclohexane (30, 31) and, perhaps of even closer relevance, the chlorination of cyclohexane by a nonheme Fe-Cl reagent (29). The SyrB2 enzyme is generating reactive intermediates because the enzyme is inacti-vated after approximately seven catalytic cycles under the reaction conditions. SyrB2 will not chlorinate free L-Thr or the threonyl moiety presented as the model thioester, L-Thr-S-N-acetylcysteamine, sug-gesting a strong recognition of the presenting T domain scaffold. This preference suggests the in vivo timing of SyrB2 is indeed to tailor the threonyl moiety while on SyrB1. Presumably, 4-Cl-L-Thr-S-SyrB1 is then the immediate donor to the growing octapeptidyl-S-SyrE and incorporated as the Cl-Thr-9 found in mature syrin-gomycin (6). We have recently reported that PltA is analogously a tailoring halogenase during elongation of a pyrrolyl-S-T domain during pyoluteorin formation by the hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetaseNonepolyketide synthase assembly line (P. C. Dorrestein, E. Yeh, S. Garneau, N. L. Kelleher, and C.T.W., unpublished data). In that case, PltA is an FADH2-and O2-dependent halogenase rather than an None-KG-and O2-dependent nonheme FeII halogenase. The timing of chlorination, of acyl and aminoacyl substrates pre-sented on carrier domain proteins, may be general for other halogenated nonribosomal peptide and polyketide natural prod-ucts, e.g., in the vancomycin family of chlorinated glycopeptide antibiotics (2). Although attention has focused in recent years on the FADH2-and O2-dependent class of halogenases as the biosynthetically relevant halogenases for natural products because they are encoded within many biosynthetic gene clusters, the flavoprotein haloge-nases work primarily on activated aromatic and heteroaromatic rings of natural product scaffolds (9\u201312). They may not generally have the oxidizingNonehalogenating power to functionalize unactivated carbon centers. In this regard, nature usually turns to high-valent oxoiron, both in heme and nonheme contexts (24, 26, 32), to hydroxylate unac-tivated methyl and methylene groups. This type of reaction may be the chemical niche for nonheme FeII halogenases. It is very likely that a second example of this nonheme FeII halogenase class is the BarbB1NoneB2 pair, implicated in functionalizing the unactivated methyl group of a L-Leu moiety during trichloroleucine formation as a building block in barbamide biosynthesis (8). Thus, a subclass of the nonheme FeII None-KG-dependent superfamily may use None-KG and O2 to generate high-valent oxoiron species but divert them for halogenation, rather than hydroxylation, of many unactivated car-bon centers in the None4,000 chlorinated and brominated natural products. Deciphering how the diversion from hydroxylation to halogenation occurs during natural product maturation remains a significant challenge. We thank Dennis C.

Walsh, May 27, 2005 The nine-residue lipodepsipeptide syringomycin E, elaborated as a phytotoxin by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301D contains a 4-Cl-L-Thr-9 moiety where failure to chlorinate results in a 3-fold drop in biological activity. The proteins SyrB1 and SyrB2 encoded by the biosynthetic cluster are shown to act as a substrate and enzyme pair for SyrB2-mediated chlorination of the aminoacyl-S-enzyme L-Thr-S-SyrB1. SyrB2 is a member of the nonheme FeII None-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme superfamily, and requires O2 and None-ketoglutarate as well as chloride ion to carry out monochlo-rination of the -CH3 group of L-Thr-S-SyrB1. Chlorination of L-Thr-S-SyrB1 was validated by thioesterase-mediated release of L-Thr and 4-Cl-L-Thr, N-derivatization as fluorescent isoindoles, and HPLC separation compared with authentic standards. Incubations with L-[14C]Thr and [36ClNone] as well as MS of the released products further validated identification.

These products include chlorinated nonribosomal peptides such as the vancomycin and teicoplanin family of glycopeptides (2) and aromatic polyketides such as chlorotetracycline (3). Most of the organochlorine linkages are in aromatic or het-eroaromatic rings, such as the 3-Cl-None-OH-Tyr of the glyco-peptides, the chloro substituent in the aminocoumarin antibi-otics (2\u20134), and the 4,5-dichloropyrrole in pyoluteorin (5) (Fig. 1A). There are also aliphatic carbons bearing one, two, or three chlorine atoms in natural products, such as the 4-Cl-L-Thr at residue nine of the peptide scaffold of the phytotoxic syrin-gomycin E from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301D (6), the dichlorinated None-hydroxy acid of lyngbyabellin A (7), and the trichloroleucine-derived moiety in barbamide (8) (Fig. 1B). Both the aliphatic and aromatic C-Cl linkages are generated enzymatically.",
        "The timing and mechanism for covalent incorporation of chlo-rine into these diverse groups of natural products has been unclear, but two lines of information have clarified some of the molecular logic of enzymatic halogenation. The first line has come largely from the isolation and characterization of regioselective tryptophan halogenases from the pyrrolnitrin pathway (9, 10), the rebeccamy-cin pathway (11), and the pyrroindomycin B pathway (12). This type of halogenase was shown to have a requirement for FADH2 and O2 as cofactors (9, 11). More recently, we have characterized a pyrrole-dichlorinating flavoprotein PltA in the pyoluteorin pathway (P. C. Dorrestein, E. Yeh, S. Garneau, N. L. Kelleher, and C.T.W., unpublished data). Microbial genome sequencing has turned up homologous 50-kDa ORFs with FAD signature binding sites as predicted halogenases in the biosynthetic gene clusters for several nonribosomal peptide and polyketide halogenated metabolites. The general view now is that aromatic and heteroaromatic ring halogenations are effected by such flavoprotein halogenases, al-though both mechanistic understanding of the active chlorinating",
        "species and timing of halogenation relative to peptide chain elon-gation is still rudimentary. Halogenation at aliphatic carbon centers of amino acid constit-uents of nonribosomal peptides appears to use different enzymatic machinery. For example, neither the barbamide synthetase assem-bly line gene cluster nor the syringomycin synthetase cluster (6, 8) contain obvious flavoprotein halogenase homologs. Instead, they have ORFs predicted to be nonheme FeII, None-ketoglutarate (None-KG)-requiring enzymes. In this study, we have purified the SyrB1 and SyrB2 components of the syringomycin synthetase from P. syringae (6) in active form. We demonstrate that L-Thr, tethered in thioester linkage to the peptidyl carrier protein domain of SyrB1, is chlori-nated to 4-Cl-L-Thr-S-SyrB1 by the purified FeII-containing SyrB2 enzyme in the presence of O2, None-KG, and chloride ions, providing direct evidence of aliphatic halogenase activity for a nonheme FeII enzyme.

        "Characterization of SyrB1 Activity. SyrB1 is a 66-kDa didomain protein, consisting of an adenylation (A) domain and a thiolation (T) domain. Previous studies had indicated it could activate L-Thr (6) and led to the conclusion that SyrB1 selects and activates Thr-9 in the syringomycin backbone. For our purposes, we wanted to confirm that SyrB1 would show selectivity for L-Thr over 4-Cl-L-Thr as would be anticipated if chlorination occurred after covalent loading and formation of L-Thr-S-SyrB1. The first half-reaction of the A domain, reversible formation of L-Thr-AMP, was followed by amino acid-dependent exchange of [32PPi] into ATP. In the pres-ence of 5 mM amino acid, the relative rates were obtained as follows: L-Thr (100 None 3.6%), L-Ser (3.1 None 0.1%), 4-Cl-L-Thr (1.14 None 0.01%), D-Thr (1.01 None 0.01%), L-Ile (0.40 None 0.01%), L-Leu (0.33 None 0.01%), and D-Ser (0.24 None 0.04%). All other proteinogenic L-amino acids were tested and showed a rate of 0.25% or less when compared with L-Thr. The high specificity of SyrB1 for L-Thr was confirmed by a 60-fold selectivity in the apparent kinetic parame-ters for L-Thr (Km None 3.1 None 0.2 mM; kcat None 29.1 None 0.9 minNone1; kcatNone Km None 9.4 None 0.4 mMNone1minNone1) vs. L-Ser (Km None 7.7 None 0.5 mM; kcat None 1.23 None 0.05 minNone1; kcatNoneKm None 0.161 None 0.006 mMNone1minNone1).

        "Chlorination Activity of SyrB2. To evaluate the activity of SyrB2, the enzyme was removed from anaerobic storage just before incuba-tions and added to L-Thr-S-SyrB1. In the presence of the three cosubstrates (O2, None-KG, and chloride ions), halogenation activity was observed. Given that the amino acid is covalently tethered to the T domain of SyrB1, detection of product involved the release of the aminoacyl moieties by enzymatic treatment with a thioes-terase, TycF. The amount of 4-Cl-L-Thr product is, at best, stoi-chiometric with the amount of SyrB1 (10 nmol) present in the incubations as protein substrate. To facilitate detection, the amino acids were derivatized with None-phthalaldehyde and 3-mercaptopro-pionate to yield the highly fluorescent isoindole derivatives (22). As shown in Fig. 3A, the enzymatic incubation with SyrB2 gave both L-[14C]-Thr substrate-derived isoindole and 4-Cl-L-[14C]Thr prod-uct-derived isoindole. Product formation depended on SyrB2. In addition to the radio-HPLC cochromatography with authentic isoindole standards (Fig. 3A), the SyrB1NoneB2 incubations were scaled up with nonradioactive L-Thr as substrate and subjected to MS to confirm identification. As noted in Fig. 3B, peak 1 from the HPLC of the enzymatic reaction workup gave the L-Thr-derived isoindole while peak 2 had the mass of the 4-Cl-L-Thr adduct, containing the isotopic signature of a chlorine atom.",

Additionally, it was possible to demonstrate incorporation of radioactive chloride ion into the SyrB1 protein by using SDS polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4C) that depends on the presence of L-Thr, interpreted as formation of [36Cl]-L-Thr-S-SyrB1. In studies not shown, we demonstrated that SyrB2 would not chlorinate free L-Thr or the small molecule surrogate for L-Thr-S-SyrB1, L-Thr-S-N-acetylcysteamine (23).",

        "reaction remains to be undertaken, given the difficulties in deter-mining the conversion of a 66-kDa aminoacyl-S-protein substrate to a chloro-aminoacyl-S-protein product. Discussion This study demonstrates that SyrB2 is a nonheme FeII-containing enzyme that has a previously uncharacterized cata-lytic activity, the ability to halogenate an aliphatic methyl group on a protein-bound threonyl thioester. In the course of this initial work, we repeated the earlier demonstration that SyrB1 acti-vated L-Thr and proved in addition that it would install the threonyl moiety on its thiolation domain. This reaction was enabled by in vitro phosphopantetheinylation of SyrB1 to convert it from the apo form to the holo form of the T domain, able to engage in aminoacyl-S-T domain formation. In turn, this L-Thr-S-SyrB1 constitutes the substrate for SyrB2. SyrB2 is thus a tailoring enzyme working in trans on the threonyl group presented by the SyrB1 T domain scaffold. Our anaerobic purification and reconstitution of SyrB2 with FeII was designed to minimize any untoward oxidative damage of the active site from adventitious uncoupled reaction with O2. The successful reconsti-tution with FeII validated bioinformatics predictions that SyrB2 would be an FeII enzyme. Further, the increase to full stoichiometry of FeII reconstitution in the presence of None-KG indicated that None-KG is a stabilizing ligand for FeII, as noted for other enzymes in this enzyme superfamily (24). The previously described members of the None-KG-dependent nonheme FeII enzymes bind None-KG as a ligand to iron. After decarboxylation in the presence of cosubstrate O2, succinate and CO2 are generated together with a high-valent FeIVAO oxoiron species, which is a potent oxidizing and hydroxylating species toward bound substrate (25). Indeed, assays of SyrB2 show a comparable requirement for both O2 and None-KG for catalytic turnover. The product outcome, however, is divergent. SyrB2 chlorinates but does not detectably hydroxylate L-Thr-S-SyrB1. The incorporation of chloride into the threonyl scaffold was validated by cochromatography of the released product as the isoindole deriv-ative, incorporation of radioactive [36ClNone], and MS with the signa-ture isotopic doublet for a monochlorinated compound. Mechanistic studies remain for this transformation, but the proposed pathway in Fig. 5 is likely. As with other O2 cleaving, None-KG-decarboxylating enzymes, one can find conserved histidines",

        "and aspartate as putative ligands for FeII (26\u201327). The formation of the FeIVAO ferryl species is likely to be a common intermediate in both the oxygenase and halogenase mechanism. The high-valent oxoiron species can break unactivated C-H bonds in substrates homolytically to produce the substrate radical and an FeIII-OH as donor of an OHNone by radical rebound to complete hydroxylation (24, 25, 28). We anticipate that there will be a chloride ion bound to the FeIV intermediate of the SyrB2 active site. After C-H homolysis at carbon 4 of the threonyl moiety of L-Thr-S-SyrB1, there could be a competition between transfer of OHNone or ClNone to the threonyl CH2None. Because no hydroxylation is detected (data not shown), we assume an orientation favoring ClNone transfer. A favored reactivity toward chlorination could also be due to the lower potential of ClNone vs. OHNone (29). This proposed enzyme chemistry has precedent in two model systems where transfers of metal-coordinated ClNone have been for-mulated: chromyl chloride-mediated chlorination of cyclohexane (30, 31) and, perhaps of even closer relevance, the chlorination of cyclohexane by a nonheme Fe-Cl reagent (29). The SyrB2 enzyme is generating reactive intermediates because the enzyme is inacti-vated after approximately seven catalytic cycles under the reaction conditions.",
        "SyrB2 will not chlorinate free L-Thr or the threonyl moiety presented as the model thioester, L-Thr-S-N-acetylcysteamine, sug-gesting a strong recognition of the presenting T domain scaffold. This preference suggests the in vivo timing of SyrB2 is indeed to tailor the threonyl moiety while on SyrB1. Presumably, 4-Cl-L-Thr-S-SyrB1 is then the immediate donor to the growing octapeptidyl-S-SyrE and incorporated as the Cl-Thr-9 found in mature syrin-gomycin (6). We have recently reported that PltA is analogously a tailoring halogenase during elongation of a pyrrolyl-S-T domain during pyoluteorin formation by the hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetaseNonepolyketide synthase assembly line (P. C. Dorrestein, E. Yeh, S. Garneau, N. L. Kelleher, and C.T.W., unpublished data). In that case, PltA is an FADH2-and O2-dependent halogenase rather than an None-KG-and O2-dependent nonheme FeII halogenase. The timing of chlorination, of acyl and aminoacyl substrates pre-",
        "sented on carrier domain proteins, may be general for other halogenated nonribosomal peptide and polyketide natural prod-ucts, e.g., in the vancomycin family of chlorinated glycopeptide antibiotics (2). Although attention has focused in recent years on the FADH2-and O2-dependent class of halogenases as the biosynthetically relevant halogenases for natural products because they are encoded within many biosynthetic gene clusters, the flavoprotein haloge-nases work primarily on activated aromatic and heteroaromatic rings of natural product scaffolds (9\u201312). They may not generally have the oxidizingNonehalogenating power to functionalize unactivated carbon centers. In this regard, nature usually turns to high-valent oxoiron, both in heme and nonheme contexts (24, 26, 32), to hydroxylate unac-tivated methyl and methylene groups. This type of reaction may be the chemical niche for nonheme FeII halogenases. It is very likely that a second example of this nonheme FeII halogenase class is the BarbB1NoneB2 pair, implicated in functionalizing the unactivated methyl group of a L-Leu moiety during trichloroleucine formation as a building block in barbamide biosynthesis (8). Thus, a subclass of the nonheme FeII None-KG-dependent superfamily may use None-KG and O2 to generate high-valent oxoiron species but divert them for halogenation, rather than hydroxylation, of many unactivated car-bon centers in the None4,000 chlorinated and brominated natural products. Deciphering how the diversion from hydroxylation to halogenation occurs during natural product maturation remains a significant challenge. We thank Dennis C.
