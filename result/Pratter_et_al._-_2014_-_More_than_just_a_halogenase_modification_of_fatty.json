Pratter,[a] Jakov Ivkovic,[b] Ruth Birner-Gruenberger,[c] Rolf Breinbauer,[b] Klaus Zangger,[d] and Grit D. Straganz*[a] Introduction Nonribosomal lipopeptides from bacterial, fungal or botanical sources with antimicrobial, anti-infective, and anticancer prop-erties have been used for decades as potent pharmaceuticals. Because of their diversity, the exploration of these complex natural products is a popular and promising route for the dis-covery of new drugs. Many lipopeptides bear halogenated aliphatic moieties\u2014modifications that strongly influence com-pound bioactivity.[1] The molecular basis of this chemically chal-lenging catalysis is a focus of this research. Mononuclear non-heme iron (MNH) and a-ketoglutaric acid (a-KG)-dependent halogenases are arguably the most potent halogenating enzymes in nature, because of their unique abili-ty to selectively transform carbon centers in nonactivated lipo-peptide building blocks. MNH halogenases are generally found in polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways, and act on substrates that are tethered to the thiolation domain of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) or pep-tidyl carrier protein (PCP) by a phosphopantetheinyl (PPT) moiety.[1] Since the first report of an a-KG-dependent MNH hal-ogenase,[2] only a handful of representatives have been bio-chemically characterized.[1, 3\u20135] Analysis of the structure of Pseu-domonas syringae threonyl halogenase SyrB2 has established the view that a-KG-dependent halogenases provoke halogena-tions because of a structural variation that sets them apart from the highly homologous ketoacid-dependent oxygenases: instead of the prototypical metal-binding facial triad of oxy-genases (two histidines and one aspartate/glutamate), these halogenases have a small hydrophobic amino acid that substi-tutes for the carboxylic acid moiety and provides space for a chloride ion to coordinate to the iron.[6] During the reaction mechanism, O2 is activated and decarboxylates a-KG. The re-sulting high-valent FeIV=O species abstracts a hydrogen atom, and a ClNoneFeIIINoneOH species forms; in this, the chloride success-fully competes with the hydroxy ligand for transfer to the sub-strate radical.[1, 7] This competition strongly depends on the po-sitioning of the substrate relative to the ClNoneFeIIINoneOH species.[8] Biochemical characterization of a-KG-dependent halogenas-es has mainly targeted monodomain enzymes that modify nonactivated amino acyl precursors. Another type of a-KG-de-pendent halogenase was found in a PKS/NRPS multi-domain protein and acts on activated carbon atoms: the JamE-halo-genase domain (JamE-Hal) in the jamaicamide pathway chlori-nates the g-position of a 3-hydroxy-3-(4-pentynyl)glutaryl sub-strate, followed by a dehydratase and a decarboxylase, which transforms the a-hydroxyl halogen to a terminal vinyl-chloride moiety.[3] The closely related cryptic halogenase CurA-Hal domain from the curacin A pathway, which is involved in the synthesis of a cyclopropyl moiety, shows similar enzymatic ac-The highly selective oxidative halogenations by non-heme iron and a-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes are key reactions in the biosynthesis of lipopeptides, and often bestow valuable bioactivity to the metabolites. Here we present the first bio-chemical characterization of a putative fatty acyl halogenase, HctB, which is found in the hectochlorin biosynthetic pathway of Lyngbya majuscula. Its unprecedented three-domain struc-ture, which includes an acyl carrier protein domain, allows self-contained conversion of the covalently tethered hexanoyl sub-strate. Structural analysis of the native product by 13C NMR re-veals high regioselectivity but considerable catalytic promiscui-ty. This challenges the classification of HctB as a primary halo-genase: along with the proposed dichlorination, HctB performs oxygenation and an unprecedented introduction of a vinyl-chloride moiety into the nonactivated carbon chain. The re-laxed substrate specificity is discussed with reference to a molecular model of the enzyme\u2013substrate complex. The results suggest that fatty acyl transformation at the metal center of HctB can bring about considerable structural diversity in the biosynthesis of lipopeptides. [a] S. M. Pratter, Dr. G. D.

This implies a, so far uncharacterized, halogenase subtype, one that chlori-nates nonactivated carbons in non-amino-acyl substrates. Ge-netic data of the hypothetical fatty acyl halogenase HctB from the hectochlorin pathway in Lyngbya majuscula indicate an un-usual three-domain structure:[9] an N-terminal catalytic halo-genase domain, an acyl-coenzyme An acyl coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP) domain of unknown function, and the sub-strate-anchoring ACP. The distinct three-module organization might be a common feature of fatty acyl halogenases, but so far only one other gene of similar organization has been re-ported,[10] so more data will be needed to substantiate this. Results and Discussion The aim of this study was to explore the catalytic potential of the subfamily of MNH and a-KG-dependent fatty acyl halogen-ases that modify nonactivated medium-chain fatty acyl moiet-ies. The catalytic metal center of an a-KG-dependent halogen-ase is in principle bifunctional, and the strong preference for chlorination over oxygenation is believed to be because of the substrate\u2019s precise positioning.[8] Because unbranched, hydro-phobic fatty acyl chains (presumably housed in \u201cslippery\u201d hy-drophobic channels) are expected to show more flexibility than the small amino acid and 3-hydroxy-3-acyl-glutaryl build-ing blocks of amino-acyl and keto-acyl halogenases, we were particularly interested in the chemo-and regioselectivities of fatty acyl halogenases. The first documented example of these for which the encoding gene cluster and natural product are known is HctB,[9] the target enzyme of this work. Production and spectral characterization of functional HctB Because functional expression and reconstitution of multido-main proteins present special challenges, the purified enzyme was characterized in terms of its secondary structure, its com-petence to bind the cofactor, and the efficiency of substrate loading. Full-length HctBs with an N-or C-terminal Strep-tag II were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Soluble pro-tein was obtained only under an optimized procedure: fermen-tation at 18 8C and cell disruption with a buffer containing Na2CO3. SDS PAGE analysis confirmed the purity of HctB (> 95 %) and the theoretical molecular weight (56.8 kDa; see Fig-ure S1 in the Supporting Information). CD spectroscopy indi-cated properly folded protein with 24 % a-helices, 25 % b-sheets, 20 % turns, and 30 % unordered regions (Figure S2). Be-cause of its higher protein yield (~40 mg LNone1 cell culture), the C-terminally tagged form was used for all following experi-ments. Spectrophotometric iron determination revealed 4\u20138 % FeII in the isolated protein. Enzymes from PKS/NRPS metabolic pathways typically re-quire substrates that are covalently bound to a conserved serine residue, embedded in the thiolation domain of an ACP/ PCP, by a PPT moiety. In the absence of an available native transferase, we chose the Bacillus subtilis enzyme Sfp,[11] which is known to transfer a range of acyl-PPT moieties from respec-tively substituted coenzyme A (CoA) analogues, and covalently attach them to ACP domains from a variety of organisms. The PPT binding area of the ACP domain in HctB (Y-A-L-G-S-A-E) shows significant deviation from the consensus motif (L/V-G/L-G/A/F/Y-D/H/K/E-S-L/Q-D/A/G).[12] Thus, in a first step, the prin-ciple ability of Sfp to transfer an acyl-PPT moiety onto HctB was assessed by a fluorescence-based method: incubation of ApoHctB with Sfp and BODIPY-CoA (which Sfp can competent-ly transfer). Subsequent analysis by SDS PAGE demonstrated fluorescence labeling of HctB (Figure S3). Efficient modification of HctB with the PPT form of the native hexanoyl substrate was verified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis : the d= 450 Da change in mass (from 56 785 to 57 235 Da) after the Sfp reaction is in line with the theoretical mass shift (438 Da) expected upon ad-dition of the hexanoyl-PPT moiety to ApoHctB (56 778 Da), which gives hexanoyl-PPTylated HoloHctB (57 216 Da). No re-sidual signal was found at m/z 56 785, thus demonstrating effi-cient transfer of the hexanoyl-PPT moiety to HctB (Figure S4). Bidentate binding of the a-ketoacid cofactor to the FeII site is a prerequisite for O2 activation in a-KG-dependent enzymes, and is characterized by the typical metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band (approximately 530 nm).[13] a-KG binding to the FeII core in HoloHctB was confirmed by anaerobic UV\u2013 vis spectrometry. Addition of 150 mm a-KG to 300 mm FeII-loaded HoloHctB resulted in a broad absorption band centered around 500 nm. With equimolar a-KG and FeII-HoloHctB, the extinction coefficient (e490) was approximately 125 m None1 cmNone1; this did not increase upon addition of more a-KG. The band was present in both the absence (Figure S5) and presence of NaCl. This implies that the enzymatic FeII a-KG complex does not depend on the presence of chloride. Characterization of HctB activity Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring O2 consump-tion in air-saturated enzyme preparations (260 mm O2) over time. In the absence of FeII or a-KG cofactors no oxygen deple-tion was detectable. In the presence of stoichiometric amounts Scheme 1. Examples of natural products with saturated halo fatty acyl moi-of FeII and a-KG, HoloHctB displayed O2 consumption rates that were essentially unchanged at higher a-KG concentrations (Figure S6 B). Depending on the concentration of chloride, ap-parent first-order rate constants of O2 depletion, k app O2 , ranged from (0.42None0.21) minNone1 at less than 0.1 mm NaCl to (12.11None 4.11) minNone1 (average rate) at None1 m NaCl (Figure 1 A). The stoi-chiometry of O2 consumption was characterized by determin-ing the ratio of depleted O2 to enzyme concentration (Fig-ure S7). a-KG addition and O2 consumption were stoichiomet-ric up to a concentration that corresponded to (1.91None0.26) equivalents of HctB, and then reached a plateau. This is in line with a double oxidation of the ligand, whereby the employed HoloHctB is fully functional and O2 consumption and substrate conversion are strongly coupled. When a-KG concentrations were more than one equivalent of enzyme, curves became biphasic with a slower phase (k0appO2 = 0.8None0.3 min None1; Fig-ure S6 A), and the amplitudes of both phases became equal when a-KG concentration was two or more equivalents of enzyme. This might indicate distinct reaction rates for the first and second halogenation step. Full reaction rate and turnover was only achieved at more than 100 mm NaCl; at high chloride concentrations, as present in sea water,[14] the enzymatic activi-ty was maintained. In halogenases, the presence of substrate has been found to be crucial for O2 activation. [7a, 15] To test the necessity of sub-strate for HctB activity, the rates of O2 consumption by ApoHctB were compared to those for HoloHctB (Figure S6 A). In the absence of chloride, ApoHctB showed much reduced activity (kappO2 = (0.08None0.06) min None1). This basal rate increased approximately 11-fold in the presence of None1 m chloride (kappO2 = (0.87None0.28) minNone1). In comparison, the presence of covalently linked substrate led to an approximately fivefold increase in O2 consumption rate. Comparison of apo-and holoenzymes under NaCl saturation shows that covalently tethered substrate enhances enzymatic activity approximately 14 times. In con-trast, addition of hexanoyl-CoA or hexanoic acid to ApoHctB did not significantly elevate O2 consumption rates (in the ab-sence or presence, respectively, of 1 m NaCl), thus indicating that covalent linkage of the substrate to HctB is required for activity. The strong impact of the chloride concentration on O2 consumption rates (Figure 1) suggests that, in addition to sub-strate, chloride is required for efficient primary O2 activation in HctB. This is the first time that the impact of chloride concen-tration on O2 consumption rates of a non-heme iron halogen-ase has been reported; current investigations aim at clarifying the role of chloride regarding O2 reduction in HctB. The catalytic and ACP domains in HctB are separated by an ACBP of unknown function. For homologous ACBPs, a role as an intracellular acyl-CoA transporter has been ascribed; in-volvement in intermediary metabolism and gene regulation in various organisms has also been proposed.[16] In order to test for a regulatory role of this high-affinity acyl-CoA binding domain during catalysis, HoloHctB activity in the presence of a variety of acyl-CoAs was investigated. However, addition of stoichiometric hexanoyl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA, lauryl-CoA, or myristoyl-CoA did not significantly impact the O2 consumption characteristics of the enzyme. (Note that MALDI-TOF MS data showed no presence of a tightly bound acyl-CoA ligand in HoloHctB preparations; this might have masked an impact of acyl-CoAs on activity in our assay). Catalytic promiscuity MALDI-TOF MS analysis of HoloHctB revealed shifts in m/z of approximately 70 and 160 after conversions with chloride and bromide, respectively, when compared to an unconverted HoloHctB control sample (Figure S8). The observed mass shifts were consistent with dihalogenation of the substrate. Because of the low resolution of the method, however, the presence of a mixture of products with distinct masses could not be ruled out. To qualitatively identify the native reaction products, the HoloHctB acyl-moieties were hydrolyzed from their enzyme-bound PPT arm after conversion by the thioesterase TycF,[17] and tested for modifications by using a coupled HPLC-MS technique. Product solutions of NaCl-containing reactions, NaCl-free reactions, and unconverted FeII-and a-KG-free con-trols were scanned for particular m/z values. Samples from NaCl-saturated HoloHctB conversions showed species of m/z 129, 147, and 183 (corresponding to oxohexanoate, mono-chlorohexenoate, and dichlorohexanoate, respectively). No sig-nificant amounts of hexanoate (the only species present in un-converted HoloHctB samples) were found. In an \u201cNaCl-free\u201d conversion (chloride was avoided for sample and buffer prepa-rations), hexanoate and oxohexanoate were detected. Further-more, traces of monochlorohexanoate, monochlorohexenoate, and dichlorohexanoate were found, probably because of un-Figure 1. Dependency of HctB (100 mm) activity on substrate and chloride avoidable contamination of buffers with trace chloride. Addi-tionally a captured ion at 8.8 min in both NaCl-free and NaCl-saturated samples was consistent with a monohydroxyhexa-noate species (m/z 131), but could not be unambiguously identified because of a lack of available standards (signals of the detected ions are in Figure S9). The presence of chloride in the reaction products was verified by its prototypical isotope pattern. The statistically expected molecular weight ratio for monochlorinated substances (35Cl/37Cl, 3.1:1) and for dichlori-nated substances (35Cl2/ 35Cl37Cl/37Cl2, 9.8:6.3:1) was found for the elution peaks at t = 33.8 and 37.7 min; this confirmed their tentative identifications as monochlorohexenoate and di-chlorohexanoate, respectively (Figure S10). To gain more structural information on the reaction prod-ucts, acyl moieties with a fully 13C-labeled hexanoyl backbone were employed. [13C6]hexanoyl-CoA was obtained by oxidation of [13C6]hexan-1-ol and subsequent enhanced S-acylation to CoA by an established method[18] (Scheme S1) with a total yield of 36 %. [13C6]-labeled products were subjected to NMR analysis in two ways: 1) still bound to HctB and, 2) hydrolyzed and separated from the enzyme. 1H,13C HSQC of the unconvert-ed 13C-labeled hexanoyl moiety attached to HctB showed the expected broad NMR signals because of the large molecular weight. After the enzymatic reaction, a number of additional peaks were found; these were assigned after cleavage from the enzyme by recording one-dimensional 13C and two-dimen-sional 1H,13C HSQC and INADEQUATE spectra (Figure S11). The assignment was corroborated by comparison with 13C and 1H,13C HSQC spectra of hexanoic acid, 5-oxo-hexanoic acid, 6-chloro-hexanoic acid, and published values for 5,5-dichloro-hexanal.[19] For semiquantitative analysis of the relative amounts of the individual free products, 13C spectra with long relaxation delays (5 s) were recorded; intensity comparisons were performed only for signals of the same multiplicity. From these, the amount of hexanoyl substrate was determined to be approximately 10 %, thus indicating almost quantitative con-version. Identified reaction products confirmed the results from the HPLC-MS analysis: 5-oxo-hexanoic acid (~50 %), 5,5-dichlorohexanoic acid (~25 %), and 5-chlorohex-4-enoic acid (~ 25 %). No signals for monohydroxyhexanoate were found, thus indicating that this is only a minor product component (repre-sentative 13C spectrum of free products in Figure 2 A). Products identified in the free form were also found bound to the pro-tein, where they show markedly increased line widths because of the significantly increased molecular weight of the enzyme. (An overlay of an HSQC of free products and products bound to HctB is shown in Figure 2 B.) Product spectra did not signifi-cantly change for samples that were stored for several weeks at room temperature, thus indicating chemical stability of the compounds under these conditions. The impact of chloride concentration on the product spec-trum was assessed by HPLC-MS analysis. The relative concen-trations of 5,5-dichloro-hexanoic acid and 5-chloro-4-hexenoic acid were unchanged over the whole investigated range (0\u2013 1 m NaCl). The proportion of 5-oxo-hexanoic acid remained constant down to 35 mm NaCl. It was, however, significantly elevated in the salt-free sample, along with species whose masses and isotope distributions were consistent with mono-hydroxylated and monochlorinated products (Figure S12). In summary, product analysis revealed remarkable catalytic promiscuity. Intriguingly, beside dihalogenation and oxygena-tion, an unprecedented introduction of vinyl chloride into the nonactivated fatty acyl chain was observed, whereby regiose-lectivity was retained. This incorporation of a nonterminal vinyl chloride moiety into a nonactivated carbon chain by a single enzyme contrasts with the previously described MNH-depen-dent methylene-chloride formation in jamaicamides,[3] where conversion is accomplished by three enzymes and is restricted to activated substrates and the synthesis of terminal vinyl chlorides. Substrate and halogen promiscuity HctB displayed a remarkable promiscuity with alternative fatty acyl substrates.

The observed carbon\u2013carbon couplings arise from the use of uniformly 13C-labeled hexa-noic acid precursors and make the product peaks easily distinguishable from the strong singlets of the buffer (HEPES).

However, the rates decreased with growing chain length: an approximately fivefold drop for the myristoyl moiety (kappO2 = (2.4None1.0) minNone1), compared to the native substrate (Figure 3 A) was observed. O2 consumption stoichiometry did not change significantly (Figure 3 B). The principle potential of HctB for bromination in the presence of 1 m KBr was confirmed as anal-ogous to amino acyl halogenases:[20] rates were approximately four times slower (kappO2 = (3.0None1.1) min None1) than for the respec-tive chlorination reaction, and O2 consumption stoichiometry suggested less than two conversions (Figure S13). In order to rationalize the surprisingly relaxed substrate spectrum, a structural model of the HctB catalytic domain was generated and subjected to in silico docking of acyl-PPT moiet-ies. Similar, low-energy positioning was found in the vicinity of the catalytic metal center for all docked fatty acyl moieties (Figure 4). The C4\u2013C6 carbon atoms of the native substrate were close to the chloride ion (3.5\u20134.5 None) and to the iron (~6\u2013 7 None), and, in general, all ligands exposed their carbon chains to the active center (3.4\u20136.3 None to the chloride, 5.3\u20138.1 None to the metal). This is in good agreement with experimental data, which suggests that C8\u2013C14 acyl chains induce primary O2 acti-vation. In halogenases substrate binding has been found to replace a water ligand from the iron, presumably in the vicinity of the substrate and metal ion. This leads to a five-coordinate iron center that is competent to reduce O2. Docking of the ACP domain to the catalytic domain results in a low energy form, where the conserved Ser427 of the thiolation domain is less than 6 None from the terminal PPT-phosphate moiety. The re-sulting two-domain model contradicts a previously proposed role of the ACBP domain in substrate binding during cataly-sis.[10] Figure 3. HctB activity towards putative alternative fatty acyl substrates. Conclusions Multifunctionality, including de-saturase activity, has already been reported for a-KG-depen-dent MNH enzymes (e.g. , clava-minate synthase).[21] a-KG-depen-dent halogenases have been shown to halogenate their na-tive substrates: nonquantitated amounts of hydroxylation were reported in SyrB2 and these were elevated in non-native sub-strate analogues.[8] The introduc-tion of a vinyl-chloride moiety into a nonactivated carbon chain, as reported herein, is to the best of our knowledge, un-precedented. The structure of hectochlorine,[9] together with the classification of the preced-ing acyl-ACP-synthetase HctA according to sequence align-ment,[22] strongly suggests that the hexanoyl moiety is indeed the natural substrate of HctB, and that chain length specificity is determined by HctA. Our study suggests that a multifunc-tional metal center in HctB might introduce structural varie-ty into the primary building block of hectochlorin by dichlori-nation, oxygenation, and vinyl-chloride formation. The product pattern of HctB under chloride-saturating conditions displays chloride and oxo moieties exclusively at the C5 position, a double bond C4=C5. Futhermore, strong coupling of a-KG consumption to O2 depletion is observed, which, however, does not exceed two turnovers. Based on these findings and previously suggested mechanisms for a-KG-dependent halo-genases and oxygenases, we propose a reaction mechanism where initial transfer of either a metal-bound hydroxyl or chlo-ride species at C5 takes place; in a second oxidation cycle, the remaining hydrogen at C5 is abstracted. The comparatively stable radical might then undergo a second chlorination/hy-droxylation reaction or, alternatively, the intermediate ClNoneFeIIINone OH moiety might abstract a hydrogen atom from C4 to give the three observed reaction products (Scheme 2). In summary, the catalytic properties of HctB imply that the product spectrum obtained by the hectochlorin pathway in L. majuscula comprises structural variants with oxo-and vinyl-chloride alkyl chains and, by extension, that examples of the acyl-halogenase group generally display all three functionalities in equal measure. This is in line with the observation that bio-logical lipopeptide pathways often employ promiscuous en-zymes that generate a range of reactions products, which are then assembled into a variety of metabolites. The resulting structural diversity of the secondary metabolites increases the chances of producing a bioactive variant that bestows evolu-tionary fitness.[23] Experimental Section Chemicals: If not otherwise stated, chemicals were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich or Carl Roth at the highest purity available. Phusion DNA Polymerase, pKYB1 vector, and T4 DNA ligase were from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA) and restriction enzymes and buffers, and alkaline phosphatase from Fermentas (Thermo Scientific). Cloning: The hctB gene was synthesized based on the hectochlorin biosynthetic gene cluster (accession number AY974560). Therefore the sequence that codes for HctB (AY974560 is the DNA accession number to the complete sequence of the hectochlorin biosynthetic gene cluster in Lyngbya majuscula, no accession number for hctB only is available), was C-terminally appended with a Strep-tag II Scheme 2. Proposed mechanism of product formation by HctB. In the first oxidation cycle, the hexanoyl substrate (WSHPQFEK), flanked with NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, and codon optimized for expression in E. coli ; the PPT-transferase sfp sequence from B. subtilis[11] (accession AEK64474.1) was C-terminal-ly His6-tagged; both constructs were purchased from Mr. Gene GmbH, Regensburg, Germany). C-terminally tagged hctB was cut from the purchased plasmid and cloned into vector pKYB1 (New England Biolabs) by using the vector\u2019s NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. His-tagged sfp was flanked with NdeI and BamHI restriction sites by PCR, digested with the respective enzymes, and also cloned into a pKYB1 vector. The N-terminally Strep-tag II-tagged hctB construct was prepared by flanking the hctB sequence with BsaI by using the PCR technique, a subsequent restriction digest and cloning into the respective site of the pASK-IBA7plus vector (IBA, G\u00e7ttingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s proce-dures. Construct integrity was confirmed by sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany). Protein expression: The above plasmids and pET30a_TycF (the plasmid bearing the N-terminally His6-tagged tycF thioesterase gene) were introduced into E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) cells by electro-poration. HctB expression was performed in a medium that had previously been optimized for the expression of a MNH dioxyge-nase.[24] Expression cultures (300 mL) were inoculated with over-night culture (to OD600 = 0.1\u20130.2) and allowed to grow (37 8C, 110 rpm). At OD600None0.7, protein expression was induced by addi-tion of IPTG (100 mg mLNone1). After incubation (18 8C, 22 h), cells were harvested and resuspended in AP2 buffer (Tris (50 mm, pH 8.5), NaCl (150 mm), Na2CO3 (100 mm), glycerol (5 %)). Sfp and TycF were both produced in 2 None YT. Sfp was expressed according to the HctB protocol but at 25 8C and with resuspension in TMGD buffer (pH 6.9)[11] TycF was expressed as previously described.[17] Protein purification: Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French press (~24 000 psi). After removal of cell debris (78 000 g, 35 min, 4 8C), soluble Strep-tagged HctB was purified on a Strep-Tactin Superflow column (IBA) according to the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions, and buffer exchanged into HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.5). His-tagged Sfp and TycF were purified by affinity chroma-tography on a self-packed Cu-chelat column (Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) with a stepwise imidazole gradient (Tris (50 mm, pH 7.5), NaCl (300 mm), imidazole (0\u2013400 mm)). TycF was buffer exchanged into HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.5) ; Sfp was buffer ex-changed into TMGD (pH 6.9). Cell disruption, affinity chromatogra-phy, buffer exchange, and concentration of protein samples (Viva-spin 20; Sartorius, Tagelswangen, Switzerland) were performed at 4 8C. The protein concentration of HctB was determined by a modi-fied procedure of Edelhoch and Pace.[25] Concentrations of Sfp and TycF were determined by using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The purity of the isolated enzymes and their molecu-lar weights were verified by SDS-PAGE (GE Healthcare; see Fig-ures S1 and S14). FeII content: The quantity of FeII in HctB preparations was deter-mined photometrically at 25 8C in Tris\u00b7HCl (20 mm, pH 7.5) accord-ing to the method of Hennessy et al.[26] by using ~350-fold molar excess of Ferene-S (3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-di(2-furyl)-1,2,4-triazine-5\u2019,5\u2019\u2019-di-sulfonic acid) Detachment of iron from the native protein and con-comitant formation of the colored FeII\u2013Ferene-S complex (e592 = 35.5 mmNone1 cmNone1) was monitored over 15\u201318 h. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy: Far-UV CD spectra were re-corded on a J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco; RT, 0.02 cm path length, cylindrical cell) as described previously,[27] with enzymes (~ 0.40 mg mLNone1) in potassium phosphate (20 mm, pH 7.5). Three spectra ( 300\u2013185 nm) were averaged and corrected by a blank spectrum (lacking enzyme) before converting the CD signal into mean residue ellipticity. Data were processed at the DichroWeb server (http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk).[28] Reconstitution of HoloHctB: Aliquots of ApoHctB (200\u2013500 nmol) were mixed with Sfp (0.1 equiv) and the respective fatty acyl CoA (C6\u2013C14, 2 equiv) in transfer buffer (Tris\u00b7Cl (75 mm, pH 7.5), MgCl2 (10 mm)), to a final HctB concentration of 200\u2013500 mm. Reaction mixtures were incubated on a thermo-shaker (24 8C, 350 rpm, 1\u2013 1.5 h). Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation prior to buffer exchange to either Tris\u00b7H2SO4 (20 mm, pH 7.5) or HEPES/ NaOH, (20 mm, pH 7.5). HoloHctB samples were concentrated (~ two-to fivefold), and protein concentrations were reassessed. Bodipy-CoA transfer assay: Bodipy-CoA was prepared according to La Clair et al.[29] and then transferred (as described for fatty acyl substrates). Samples were subjected to SDS PAGE and analyzed by a fluorescence scanner (Bio-Rad; lex = 532 nm, lem = 555 nm) with a long pass filter. Mass spectrometry: Purified protein solutions were desalted by re-peated cycles of concentration and dilution in TFA (0.1 %) by using 10 kDa cut off Amicon ultrafiltration tubes (Merck Millipore), then diluted (1:10, v/v) in acetonitrile (50 %) and TFA (0.1 %), and mixed (1:1, v/v) with super-DHB matrix (5 mg; 9:1 mixture of 2,5-dihydrox-ybenzoic acid and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid) in acetonitrile (50 mL) and TFA (50 mL, 0.1 %). Samples (1 mL) were spotted onto an 800 mm MTP AnchorChip (Bruker) and left to dry. MALDI-TOF-MS measurements were performed on an ultrafleXtreme spectrometer (Bruker). Full MS spectra were obtained in positive linear mode (mass/charge range 8 000\u201377 000) after external calibration with the appropriate protein standard (10\u201370 kDa). a-KG binding: Anaerobic HoloHctB samples (300 mm) in the ab-sence or presence of NaCl (1 m) were prepared in HEPES/NaOH (20 mm, pH 7.5) in air-tight NextGen V Vials with septa-sealed open-top screw caps (Wheaton Millville, NJ, USA), and purged with nitrogen. Residual O2 was consumed by adding an equimolar amount of acetylacetone, and depleting with the dioxygenase Dke1 (4\u20135 mm), which is available in our lab.[27] Nitrogen-flushed, O2-free Fe II and a-KG cofactors were added as stock solutions in microliter quantities in an N2-purged glove box to yield 300 mm Fe II and 0, 150, 300, or 600 mm a-KG. Spectra (250\u2013800 nm) were re-corded on a CARY 50 Bio UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Varian/ Agilent Technologies). Three replicates (1200 nm minNone1) were per-formed for each condition and averaged for analysis. HctB activity assay: Apo-and HoloHctB activities were recorded by monitoring O2 consumption over time with a luminescence-based Needle-Type Oxygen Microsensor (Type PSt1) (PreSens, Re-gensburg, Germany) in an air-tight cell. Enzymes (100 mm) were tested with stirring at 23 8C in either Tris\u00b7H2SO4 (500 mL, 20 mm, pH 7.5) or HEPES/NaOH (500 mL, 20 mm, air-saturated, pH 7.5) sup-plemented with NaCl (0\u20132 m) or KBr (1 m). a-KG was added as an air-saturated aqueous stock solution (5\u2013100 mm, final concentra-tion 50\u20131000 mm); FeII was added as an anaerobic aqueous stock solution (15 mm, final concentration 150 mm). Reaction rates of substrate turnover at 260 mm O2 (k app O2 ) were calculated based on fits to a single (f = y0 + ae (Nonebx)) or double (f = y0 + ae (Nonebx) + ce(Nonedx)) ex-ponential decay (Sigma Plot 9.0), where y0 is the final O2 concentra-tion after conversion, a and c are the amplitudes of the curve, b and d are the respective kappO2 and k 0app O2 values, and x is time in sec-onds. Determined rates were validated by using the initial reaction rate divided by the protein concentration. None 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim ChemBioChem 2014, 15, 567 \u2013 574 573 CHEMBIOCHEM FULL PAPERS www.chembiochem.org Isolation of reaction products: HoloHctB samples from activity assays were pooled, buffer exchanged into HEPES/NaOH (20 mm, pH 7.5), and concentrated to ~1 mm. Acyl-moiety cleavage from the enzyme ACP domain was accomplished by incubating (30 8C, 350 rpm, overnight) with thioesterase TycF[17] (15\u201330 mm). Precipi-tated protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to a VivaSpin 500 centrifugal filter (Sartorius) and the fil-trate, which contained the cleaved carbonic acid, was collected. Samples for 13C NMR analysis were supplemented with deuterium oxide (10 %). HPLC-MS analysis: Reaction products (cleaved from the enzyme) and standard solutions of hexanoic acid, 5-oxo-hexanoic acid, and 6-chloro hexanoic acid were acidified with formic acid (FA; 1 %, v/ v). HPLC analysis was performed with a 1200 Infinity Series system (Agilent Technologies) and a LiChroCART Purospher STAR column (Merck Millipore; 30 8C, 0.8 mL minNone1) with FA (1 % in water; solvent A) and FA (1 % in acetonitrile; solvent B): 10 % B (10 min), 10\u201350 % B (30 min), 50\u201390 % B (1 min), 90 % B (3 min), 90\u201310 % (1 min), 10 % B (10 min). Separated components were analyzed by ESI-MS single ion monitoring (SIM) in a negative ion detection mode. Synthesis of [13C6]-labeled acyl-CoA: The synthesis of [ 13C6]hexan-oyl-CoA was from commercially available [13C6]hexan-1-ol (Sigma\u2013 Aldrich). A microscale model synthesis was developed first with unlabeled hexan-1-ol. [13C6]Hexanoyl-CoA was obtained in a total yield of 36 % by oxidation of [13C6]hexan-1-ol [30] and subsequent en-hanced S-acylation to CoA by a published method[18] with PyBOP as the coupling agent (Scheme S1). NMR analysis: 13C-labeled enzyme\u2013product complexes and hydro-lyzed reaction products were analyzed on an Avance III 700 MHz NMR spectrometer (298 K; Bruker) equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryo probe. For the one-dimensional 13C NMR spectra, 16 384 scans were acquired in 8.5 h; 1H,13C HSQCs were recorded with 16 scans for each of the 128 increments. For INADEQUATE spectra, 512 scans were accumulated for each of the 64 transients. HctB structural modeling and in silico docking: A structural model of the HoloHctB halogenase and ACP domains was generat-ed by a combination of in silico docking and MD simulations (see the Supporting Information).

        "Introduction",
        "Nonribosomal lipopeptides from bacterial, fungal or botanical sources with antimicrobial, anti-infective, and anticancer prop-erties have been used for decades as potent pharmaceuticals. Because of their diversity, the exploration of these complex natural products is a popular and promising route for the dis-covery of new drugs. Many lipopeptides bear halogenated aliphatic moieties\u2014modifications that strongly influence com-pound bioactivity.[1] The molecular basis of this chemically chal-lenging catalysis is a focus of this research.",
        "Mononuclear non-heme iron (MNH) and a-ketoglutaric acid (a-KG)-dependent halogenases are arguably the most potent halogenating enzymes in nature, because of their unique abili-ty to selectively transform carbon centers in nonactivated lipo-peptide building blocks. MNH halogenases are generally found in polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways, and act on substrates that are tethered to the thiolation domain of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) or pep-tidyl carrier protein (PCP) by a phosphopantetheinyl (PPT) moiety.[1] Since the first report of an a-KG-dependent MNH hal-ogenase,[2] only a handful of representatives have been bio-chemically characterized.[1, 3\u20135] Analysis of the structure of Pseu-domonas syringae threonyl halogenase SyrB2 has established the view that a-KG-dependent halogenases provoke halogena-tions because of a structural variation that sets them apart from the highly homologous ketoacid-dependent oxygenases: instead of the prototypical metal-binding facial triad of oxy-genases (two histidines and one aspartate/glutamate), these halogenases have a small hydrophobic amino acid that substi-tutes for the carboxylic acid moiety and provides space for a chloride ion to coordinate to the iron.[6] During the reaction mechanism, O2 is activated and decarboxylates a-KG. The re-sulting high-valent FeIV=O species abstracts a hydrogen atom, and a ClNoneFeIIINoneOH species forms; in this, the chloride success-fully competes with the hydroxy ligand for transfer to the sub-strate radical.[1, 7] This competition strongly depends on the po-sitioning of the substrate relative to the ClNoneFeIIINoneOH species.[8]",
        "Biochemical characterization of a-KG-dependent halogenas-es has mainly targeted monodomain enzymes that modify nonactivated amino acyl precursors. Another type of a-KG-de-pendent halogenase was found in a PKS/NRPS multi-domain protein and acts on activated carbon atoms: the JamE-halo-genase domain (JamE-Hal) in the jamaicamide pathway chlori-nates the g-position of a 3-hydroxy-3-(4-pentynyl)glutaryl sub-strate, followed by a dehydratase and a decarboxylase, which transforms the a-hydroxyl halogen to a terminal vinyl-chloride moiety.[3] The closely related cryptic halogenase CurA-Hal domain from the curacin A pathway, which is involved in the synthesis of a cyclopropyl moiety, shows similar enzymatic ac-",
        "The highly selective oxidative halogenations by non-heme iron and a-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes are key reactions in the biosynthesis of lipopeptides, and often bestow valuable bioactivity to the metabolites. Here we present the first bio-chemical characterization of a putative fatty acyl halogenase, HctB, which is found in the hectochlorin biosynthetic pathway of Lyngbya majuscula. Its unprecedented three-domain struc-ture, which includes an acyl carrier protein domain, allows self-contained conversion of the covalently tethered hexanoyl sub-strate. Structural analysis of the native product by 13C NMR re-veals high regioselectivity but considerable catalytic promiscui-ty. This challenges the classification of HctB as a primary halo-genase: along with the proposed dichlorination, HctB performs oxygenation and an unprecedented introduction of a vinyl-chloride moiety into the nonactivated carbon chain. The re-laxed substrate specificity is discussed with reference to a molecular model of the enzyme\u2013substrate complex. The results suggest that fatty acyl transformation at the metal center of HctB can bring about considerable structural diversity in the biosynthesis of lipopeptides.",

        "tivity.[3] Yet, several bioactive natural products with long halo-genated saturated alkyl chains are known (Scheme 1): hecto-chlorin and the related compounds dolabellin and lyngbyabel-lin A and B all harbor a 5,5-dichlorohexanoyl moiety;[9] this sug-gests dihalogenation of a C6 fatty acyl moiety. This implies a, so far uncharacterized, halogenase subtype, one that chlori-nates nonactivated carbons in non-amino-acyl substrates. Ge-netic data of the hypothetical fatty acyl halogenase HctB from the hectochlorin pathway in Lyngbya majuscula indicate an un-usual three-domain structure:[9] an N-terminal catalytic halo-genase domain, an acyl-coenzyme An acyl coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP) domain of unknown function, and the sub-strate-anchoring ACP. The distinct three-module organization might be a common feature of fatty acyl halogenases, but so far only one other gene of similar organization has been re-ported,[10] so more data will be needed to substantiate this.",
        "Results and Discussion The aim of this study was to explore the catalytic potential of the subfamily of MNH and a-KG-dependent fatty acyl halogen-ases that modify nonactivated medium-chain fatty acyl moiet-ies. The catalytic metal center of an a-KG-dependent halogen-ase is in principle bifunctional, and the strong preference for chlorination over oxygenation is believed to be because of the substrate\u2019s precise positioning.[8] Because unbranched, hydro-phobic fatty acyl chains (presumably housed in \u201cslippery\u201d hy-drophobic channels) are expected to show more flexibility than the small amino acid and 3-hydroxy-3-acyl-glutaryl build-ing blocks of amino-acyl and keto-acyl halogenases, we were particularly interested in the chemo-and regioselectivities of fatty acyl halogenases. The first documented example of these for which the encoding gene cluster and natural product are known is HctB,[9] the target enzyme of this work.",
        "Production and spectral characterization of functional HctB Because functional expression and reconstitution of multido-main proteins present special challenges, the purified enzyme was characterized in terms of its secondary structure, its com-petence to bind the cofactor, and the efficiency of substrate loading. Full-length HctBs with an N-or C-terminal Strep-tag II were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Soluble pro-tein was obtained only under an optimized procedure: fermen-tation at 18 8C and cell disruption with a buffer containing Na2CO3. SDS PAGE analysis confirmed the purity of HctB (> 95 %) and the theoretical molecular weight (56.8 kDa; see Fig-ure S1 in the Supporting Information). CD spectroscopy indi-cated properly folded protein with 24 % a-helices, 25 % b-sheets, 20 % turns, and 30 % unordered regions (Figure S2). Be-cause of its higher protein yield (~40 mg LNone1 cell culture), the C-terminally tagged form was used for all following experi-ments. Spectrophotometric iron determination revealed 4\u20138 % FeII in the isolated protein.",
        "Enzymes from PKS/NRPS metabolic pathways typically re-quire substrates that are covalently bound to a conserved serine residue, embedded in the thiolation domain of an ACP/ PCP, by a PPT moiety. In the absence of an available native transferase, we chose the Bacillus subtilis enzyme Sfp,[11] which is known to transfer a range of acyl-PPT moieties from respec-tively substituted coenzyme A (CoA) analogues, and covalently attach them to ACP domains from a variety of organisms. The PPT binding area of the ACP domain in HctB (Y-A-L-G-S-A-E) shows significant deviation from the consensus motif (L/V-G/L-G/A/F/Y-D/H/K/E-S-L/Q-D/A/G).[12] Thus, in a first step, the prin-ciple ability of Sfp to transfer an acyl-PPT moiety onto HctB was assessed by a fluorescence-based method: incubation of ApoHctB with Sfp and BODIPY-CoA (which Sfp can competent-ly transfer). Subsequent analysis by SDS PAGE demonstrated fluorescence labeling of HctB (Figure S3). Efficient modification of HctB with the PPT form of the native hexanoyl substrate was verified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis : the d= 450 Da change in mass (from 56 785 to 57 235 Da) after the Sfp reaction is in line with the theoretical mass shift (438 Da) expected upon ad-dition of the hexanoyl-PPT moiety to ApoHctB (56 778 Da), which gives hexanoyl-PPTylated HoloHctB (57 216 Da). No re-sidual signal was found at m/z 56 785, thus demonstrating effi-cient transfer of the hexanoyl-PPT moiety to HctB (Figure S4).",
        "Bidentate binding of the a-ketoacid cofactor to the FeII site is a prerequisite for O2 activation in a-KG-dependent enzymes, and is characterized by the typical metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band (approximately 530 nm).[13] a-KG binding to the FeII core in HoloHctB was confirmed by anaerobic UV\u2013 vis spectrometry. Addition of 150 mm a-KG to 300 mm FeII-loaded HoloHctB resulted in a broad absorption band centered around 500 nm. With equimolar a-KG and FeII-HoloHctB, the extinction coefficient (e490) was approximately 125 m None1 cmNone1; this did not increase upon addition of more a-KG. The band was present in both the absence (Figure S5) and presence of NaCl. This implies that the enzymatic FeII a-KG complex does not depend on the presence of chloride.",
        "Characterization of HctB activity Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring O2 consump-tion in air-saturated enzyme preparations (260 mm O2) over time. In the absence of FeII or a-KG cofactors no oxygen deple-tion was detectable. In the presence of stoichiometric amounts",

        "from (0.42None0.21) minNone1 at less than 0.1 mm NaCl to (12.11None 4.11) minNone1 (average rate) at None1 m NaCl (Figure 1 A). The stoi-chiometry of O2 consumption was characterized by determin-ing the ratio of depleted O2 to enzyme concentration (Fig-",
        "ure S7). a-KG addition and O2 consumption were stoichiomet-ric up to a concentration that corresponded to (1.91None0.26) equivalents of HctB, and then reached a plateau. This is in line with a double oxidation of the ligand, whereby the employed HoloHctB is fully functional and O2 consumption and substrate conversion are strongly coupled. When a-KG concentrations were more than one equivalent of enzyme, curves became biphasic with a slower phase (k0appO2 = 0.8None0.3 min None1; Fig-ure S6 A), and the amplitudes of both phases became equal when a-KG concentration was two or more equivalents of enzyme. This might indicate distinct reaction rates for the first and second halogenation step. Full reaction rate and turnover was only achieved at more than 100 mm NaCl; at high chloride concentrations, as present in sea water,[14] the enzymatic activi-ty was maintained.",
        "In halogenases, the presence of substrate has been found to be crucial for O2 activation. [7a, 15] To test the necessity of sub-strate for HctB activity, the rates of O2 consumption by ApoHctB were compared to those for HoloHctB (Figure S6 A). In the absence of chloride, ApoHctB showed much reduced activity (kappO2 = (0.08None0.06) min None1). This basal rate increased approximately 11-fold in the presence of None1 m chloride (kappO2 = (0.87None0.28) minNone1). In comparison, the presence of covalently linked substrate led to an approximately fivefold increase in O2 consumption rate. Comparison of apo-and holoenzymes under NaCl saturation shows that covalently tethered substrate enhances enzymatic activity approximately 14 times. In con-trast, addition of hexanoyl-CoA or hexanoic acid to ApoHctB did not significantly elevate O2 consumption rates (in the ab-sence or presence, respectively, of 1 m NaCl), thus indicating that covalent linkage of the substrate to HctB is required for activity. The strong impact of the chloride concentration on O2 consumption rates (Figure 1) suggests that, in addition to sub-strate, chloride is required for efficient primary O2 activation in HctB. This is the first time that the impact of chloride concen-tration on O2 consumption rates of a non-heme iron halogen-ase has been reported; current investigations aim at clarifying the role of chloride regarding O2 reduction in HctB.",
        "The catalytic and ACP domains in HctB are separated by an ACBP of unknown function. For homologous ACBPs, a role as an intracellular acyl-CoA transporter has been ascribed; in-volvement in intermediary metabolism and gene regulation in various organisms has also been proposed.[16] In order to test for a regulatory role of this high-affinity acyl-CoA binding domain during catalysis, HoloHctB activity in the presence of a variety of acyl-CoAs was investigated. However, addition of stoichiometric hexanoyl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA, lauryl-CoA, or myristoyl-CoA did not significantly impact the O2 consumption characteristics of the enzyme. (Note that MALDI-TOF MS data showed no presence of a tightly bound acyl-CoA ligand in HoloHctB preparations; this might have masked an impact of acyl-CoAs on activity in our assay).",
        "Catalytic promiscuity MALDI-TOF MS analysis of HoloHctB revealed shifts in m/z of approximately 70 and 160 after conversions with chloride and bromide, respectively, when compared to an unconverted HoloHctB control sample (Figure S8). The observed mass shifts were consistent with dihalogenation of the substrate. Because of the low resolution of the method, however, the presence of a mixture of products with distinct masses could not be ruled out.",
        "To qualitatively identify the native reaction products, the HoloHctB acyl-moieties were hydrolyzed from their enzyme-bound PPT arm after conversion by the thioesterase TycF,[17] and tested for modifications by using a coupled HPLC-MS technique. Product solutions of NaCl-containing reactions, NaCl-free reactions, and unconverted FeII-and a-KG-free con-trols were scanned for particular m/z values. Samples from NaCl-saturated HoloHctB conversions showed species of m/z 129, 147, and 183 (corresponding to oxohexanoate, mono-chlorohexenoate, and dichlorohexanoate, respectively). No sig-nificant amounts of hexanoate (the only species present in un-converted HoloHctB samples) were found. In an \u201cNaCl-free\u201d conversion (chloride was avoided for sample and buffer prepa-rations), hexanoate and oxohexanoate were detected. Further-more, traces of monochlorohexanoate, monochlorohexenoate, and dichlorohexanoate were found, probably because of un-",

        "avoidable contamination of buffers with trace chloride. Addi-tionally a captured ion at 8.8 min in both NaCl-free and NaCl-saturated samples was consistent with a monohydroxyhexa-noate species (m/z 131), but could not be unambiguously identified because of a lack of available standards (signals of the detected ions are in Figure S9). The presence of chloride in the reaction products was verified by its prototypical isotope pattern. The statistically expected molecular weight ratio for monochlorinated substances (35Cl/37Cl, 3.1:1) and for dichlori-nated substances (35Cl2/ 35Cl37Cl/37Cl2, 9.8:6.3:1) was found for the elution peaks at t = 33.8 and 37.7 min; this confirmed their tentative identifications as monochlorohexenoate and di-chlorohexanoate, respectively (Figure S10).",
        "To gain more structural information on the reaction prod-ucts, acyl moieties with a fully 13C-labeled hexanoyl backbone were employed. [13C6]hexanoyl-CoA was obtained by oxidation of [13C6]hexan-1-ol and subsequent enhanced S-acylation to CoA by an established method[18] (Scheme S1) with a total yield of 36 %. [13C6]-labeled products were subjected to NMR analysis in two ways: 1) still bound to HctB and, 2) hydrolyzed and separated from the enzyme. 1H,13C HSQC of the unconvert-ed 13C-labeled hexanoyl moiety attached to HctB showed the expected broad NMR signals because of the large molecular weight. After the enzymatic reaction, a number of additional peaks were found; these were assigned after cleavage from the enzyme by recording one-dimensional 13C and two-dimen-sional 1H,13C HSQC and INADEQUATE spectra (Figure S11). The assignment was corroborated by comparison with 13C and 1H,13C HSQC spectra of hexanoic acid, 5-oxo-hexanoic acid, 6-chloro-hexanoic acid, and published values for 5,5-dichloro-hexanal.[19] For semiquantitative analysis of the relative amounts of the individual free products, 13C spectra with long relaxation delays (5 s) were recorded; intensity comparisons were performed only for signals of the same multiplicity. From these, the amount of hexanoyl substrate was determined to be approximately 10 %, thus indicating almost quantitative con-version. Identified reaction products confirmed the results from the HPLC-MS analysis: 5-oxo-hexanoic acid (~50 %), 5,5-dichlorohexanoic acid (~25 %), and 5-chlorohex-4-enoic acid (~ 25 %). No signals for monohydroxyhexanoate were found, thus indicating that this is only a minor product component (repre-sentative 13C spectrum of free products in Figure 2 A). Products identified in the free form were also found bound to the pro-tein, where they show markedly increased line widths because of the significantly increased molecular weight of the enzyme. (An overlay of an HSQC of free products and products bound to HctB is shown in Figure 2 B.) Product spectra did not signifi-cantly change for samples that were stored for several weeks at room temperature, thus indicating chemical stability of the compounds under these conditions.",
        "The impact of chloride concentration on the product spec-trum was assessed by HPLC-MS analysis. The relative concen-trations of 5,5-dichloro-hexanoic acid and 5-chloro-4-hexenoic acid were unchanged over the whole investigated range (0\u2013 1 m NaCl). The proportion of 5-oxo-hexanoic acid remained constant down to 35 mm NaCl. It was, however, significantly elevated in the salt-free sample, along with species whose masses and isotope distributions were consistent with mono-hydroxylated and monochlorinated products (Figure S12).",
        "In summary, product analysis revealed remarkable catalytic promiscuity. Intriguingly, beside dihalogenation and oxygena-tion, an unprecedented introduction of vinyl chloride into the nonactivated fatty acyl chain was observed, whereby regiose-lectivity was retained. This incorporation of a nonterminal vinyl chloride moiety into a nonactivated carbon chain by a single enzyme contrasts with the previously described MNH-depen-dent methylene-chloride formation in jamaicamides,[3] where conversion is accomplished by three enzymes and is restricted to activated substrates and the synthesis of terminal vinyl chlorides.",

However, the rates decreased with growing chain length: an approximately fivefold drop for the myristoyl moiety (kappO2 = (2.4None1.0) minNone1), compared to the native substrate (Figure 3 A)",
        "was observed. O2 consumption stoichiometry did not change significantly (Figure 3 B). The principle potential of HctB for bromination in the presence of 1 m KBr was confirmed as anal-ogous to amino acyl halogenases:[20] rates were approximately four times slower (kappO2 = (3.0None1.1) min None1) than for the respec-tive chlorination reaction, and O2 consumption stoichiometry suggested less than two conversions (Figure S13).",
        "In order to rationalize the surprisingly relaxed substrate spectrum, a structural model of the HctB catalytic domain was generated and subjected to in silico docking of acyl-PPT moiet-ies. Similar, low-energy positioning was found in the vicinity of the catalytic metal center for all docked fatty acyl moieties (Figure 4). The C4\u2013C6 carbon atoms of the native substrate were close to the chloride ion (3.5\u20134.5 None) and to the iron (~6\u2013 7 None), and, in general, all ligands exposed their carbon chains to the active center (3.4\u20136.3 None to the chloride, 5.3\u20138.1 None to the metal). This is in good agreement with experimental data, which suggests that C8\u2013C14 acyl chains induce primary O2 acti-vation. In halogenases substrate binding has been found to replace a water ligand from the iron, presumably in the vicinity of the substrate and metal ion. This leads to a five-coordinate iron center that is competent to reduce O2. Docking of the ACP domain to the catalytic domain results in a low energy form, where the conserved Ser427 of the thiolation domain is less than 6 None from the terminal PPT-phosphate moiety. The re-sulting two-domain model contradicts a previously proposed role of the ACBP domain in substrate binding during cataly-sis.[10]",

        "Conclusions",
        "Multifunctionality, including de-saturase activity, has already been reported for a-KG-depen-dent MNH enzymes (e.g. , clava-minate synthase).[21] a-KG-depen-dent halogenases have been shown to halogenate their na-tive substrates: nonquantitated amounts of hydroxylation were reported in SyrB2 and these were elevated in non-native sub-strate analogues.[8] The introduc-tion of a vinyl-chloride moiety into a nonactivated carbon chain, as reported herein, is to the best of our knowledge, un-precedented. The structure of hectochlorine,[9] together with the classification of the preced-ing acyl-ACP-synthetase HctA according to sequence align-ment,[22] strongly suggests that the hexanoyl moiety is indeed the natural substrate of HctB, and that chain length specificity is determined by HctA. Our study suggests that a multifunc-tional metal center in HctB might introduce structural varie-ty into the primary building block of hectochlorin by dichlori-nation, oxygenation, and vinyl-chloride formation. The product pattern of HctB under chloride-saturating conditions displays chloride and oxo moieties exclusively at the C5 position, a double bond C4=C5. Futhermore, strong coupling of a-KG consumption to O2 depletion is observed, which, however, does not exceed two turnovers. Based on these findings and previously suggested mechanisms for a-KG-dependent halo-genases and oxygenases, we propose a reaction mechanism where initial transfer of either a metal-bound hydroxyl or chlo-ride species at C5 takes place; in a second oxidation cycle, the remaining hydrogen at C5 is abstracted. The comparatively stable radical might then undergo a second chlorination/hy-droxylation reaction or, alternatively, the intermediate ClNoneFeIIINone OH moiety might abstract a hydrogen atom from C4 to give the three observed reaction products (Scheme 2).",
        "In summary, the catalytic properties of HctB imply that the product spectrum obtained by the hectochlorin pathway in L. majuscula comprises structural variants with oxo-and vinyl-chloride alkyl chains and, by extension, that examples of the acyl-halogenase group generally display all three functionalities in equal measure. This is in line with the observation that bio-logical lipopeptide pathways often employ promiscuous en-zymes that generate a range of reactions products, which are then assembled into a variety of metabolites. The resulting structural diversity of the secondary metabolites increases the chances of producing a bioactive variant that bestows evolu-tionary fitness.[23]",

Phusion DNA Polymerase, pKYB1 vector, and T4 DNA ligase were from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA) and restriction enzymes and buffers, and alkaline phosphatase from Fermentas (Thermo Scientific). Cloning: The hctB gene was synthesized based on the hectochlorin biosynthetic gene cluster (accession number AY974560). Therefore the sequence that codes for HctB (AY974560 is the DNA accession number to the complete sequence of the hectochlorin biosynthetic gene cluster in Lyngbya majuscula, no accession number for hctB only is available), was C-terminally appended with a Strep-tag II",

C-terminally tagged hctB was cut from the purchased plasmid and cloned into vector pKYB1 (New England Biolabs) by using the vector\u2019s NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. His-tagged sfp was flanked with NdeI and BamHI restriction sites by PCR, digested with the respective enzymes, and also cloned into a pKYB1 vector. The N-terminally Strep-tag II-tagged hctB construct was prepared by flanking the hctB sequence with BsaI by using the PCR technique, a subsequent restriction digest and cloning into the respective site of the pASK-IBA7plus vector (IBA, G\u00e7ttingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s proce-dures. Construct integrity was confirmed by sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany). Protein expression: The above plasmids and pET30a_TycF (the plasmid bearing the N-terminally His6-tagged tycF thioesterase gene) were introduced into E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) cells by electro-poration. HctB expression was performed in a medium that had previously been optimized for the expression of a MNH dioxyge-nase.[24] Expression cultures (300 mL) were inoculated with over-night culture (to OD600 = 0.1\u20130.2) and allowed to grow (37 8C, 110 rpm). At OD600None0.7, protein expression was induced by addi-tion of IPTG (100 mg mLNone1). After incubation (18 8C, 22 h), cells were harvested and resuspended in AP2 buffer (Tris (50 mm, pH 8.5), NaCl (150 mm), Na2CO3 (100 mm), glycerol (5 %)). Sfp and TycF were both produced in 2 None YT. Sfp was expressed according to the HctB protocol but at 25 8C and with resuspension in TMGD buffer (pH 6.9)[11] TycF was expressed as previously described.[17] Protein purification: Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French press (~24 000 psi). After removal of cell debris (78 000 g, 35 min, 4 8C), soluble Strep-tagged HctB was purified on a Strep-Tactin Superflow column (IBA) according to the manufac-turer\u2019s instructions, and buffer exchanged into HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.5). His-tagged Sfp and TycF were purified by affinity chroma-tography on a self-packed Cu-chelat column (Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) with a stepwise imidazole gradient (Tris (50 mm, pH 7.5), NaCl (300 mm), imidazole (0\u2013400 mm)). TycF was buffer exchanged into HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.5) ; Sfp was buffer ex-changed into TMGD (pH 6.9). Cell disruption, affinity chromatogra-phy, buffer exchange, and concentration of protein samples (Viva-spin 20; Sartorius, Tagelswangen, Switzerland) were performed at 4 8C. The protein concentration of HctB was determined by a modi-fied procedure of Edelhoch and Pace.[25] Concentrations of Sfp and TycF were determined by using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The purity of the isolated enzymes and their molecu-lar weights were verified by SDS-PAGE (GE Healthcare; see Fig-ures S1 and S14). FeII content: The quantity of FeII in HctB preparations was deter-mined photometrically at 25 8C in Tris\u00b7HCl (20 mm, pH 7.5) accord-ing to the method of Hennessy et al.[26] by using ~350-fold molar excess of Ferene-S (3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-di(2-furyl)-1,2,4-triazine-5\u2019,5\u2019\u2019-di-sulfonic acid) Detachment of iron from the native protein and con-comitant formation of the colored FeII\u2013Ferene-S complex (e592 = 35.5 mmNone1 cmNone1) was monitored over 15\u201318 h. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy: Far-UV CD spectra were re-corded on a J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco; RT, 0.02 cm path length, cylindrical cell) as described previously,[27] with enzymes (~ 0.40 mg mLNone1) in potassium phosphate (20 mm, pH 7.5). Three spectra ( 300\u2013185 nm) were averaged and corrected by a blank spectrum (lacking enzyme) before converting the CD signal into mean residue ellipticity. Data were processed at the DichroWeb server (http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk).[28] Reconstitution of HoloHctB: Aliquots of ApoHctB (200\u2013500 nmol) were mixed with Sfp (0.1 equiv) and the respective fatty acyl CoA (C6\u2013C14, 2 equiv) in transfer buffer (Tris\u00b7Cl (75 mm, pH 7.5), MgCl2 (10 mm)), to a final HctB concentration of 200\u2013500 mm. Reaction mixtures were incubated on a thermo-shaker (24 8C, 350 rpm, 1\u2013 1.5 h). Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation prior to buffer exchange to either Tris\u00b7H2SO4 (20 mm, pH 7.5) or HEPES/ NaOH, (20 mm, pH 7.5). HoloHctB samples were concentrated (~ two-to fivefold), and protein concentrations were reassessed. Bodipy-CoA transfer assay: Bodipy-CoA was prepared according to La Clair et al.[29] and then transferred (as described for fatty acyl substrates). Samples were subjected to SDS PAGE and analyzed by a fluorescence scanner (Bio-Rad; lex = 532 nm, lem = 555 nm) with a long pass filter. Mass spectrometry: Purified protein solutions were desalted by re-peated cycles of concentration and dilution in TFA (0.1 %) by using 10 kDa cut off Amicon ultrafiltration tubes (Merck Millipore), then diluted (1:10, v/v) in acetonitrile (50 %) and TFA (0.1 %), and mixed (1:1, v/v) with super-DHB matrix (5 mg; 9:1 mixture of 2,5-dihydrox-ybenzoic acid and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid) in acetonitrile (50 mL) and TFA (50 mL, 0.1 %). Samples (1 mL) were spotted onto an 800 mm MTP AnchorChip (Bruker) and left to dry. MALDI-TOF-MS measurements were performed on an ultrafleXtreme spectrometer (Bruker). Full MS spectra were obtained in positive linear mode (mass/charge range 8 000\u201377 000) after external calibration with the appropriate protein standard (10\u201370 kDa). a-KG binding: Anaerobic HoloHctB samples (300 mm) in the ab-sence or presence of NaCl (1 m) were prepared in HEPES/NaOH (20 mm, pH 7.5) in air-tight NextGen V Vials with septa-sealed open-top screw caps (Wheaton Millville, NJ, USA), and purged with nitrogen. Residual O2 was consumed by adding an equimolar amount of acetylacetone, and depleting with the dioxygenase Dke1 (4\u20135 mm), which is available in our lab.[27] Nitrogen-flushed, O2-free Fe II and a-KG cofactors were added as stock solutions in microliter quantities in an N2-purged glove box to yield 300 mm Fe II and 0, 150, 300, or 600 mm a-KG. Spectra (250\u2013800 nm) were re-corded on a CARY 50 Bio UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Varian/ Agilent Technologies). Three replicates (1200 nm minNone1) were per-formed for each condition and averaged for analysis. HctB activity assay: Apo-and HoloHctB activities were recorded by monitoring O2 consumption over time with a luminescence-based Needle-Type Oxygen Microsensor (Type PSt1) (PreSens, Re-gensburg, Germany) in an air-tight cell. Enzymes (100 mm) were tested with stirring at 23 8C in either Tris\u00b7H2SO4 (500 mL, 20 mm, pH 7.5) or HEPES/NaOH (500 mL, 20 mm, air-saturated, pH 7.5) sup-plemented with NaCl (0\u20132 m) or KBr (1 m). a-KG was added as an air-saturated aqueous stock solution (5\u2013100 mm, final concentra-tion 50\u20131000 mm); FeII was added as an anaerobic aqueous stock solution (15 mm, final concentration 150 mm).

        "Isolation of reaction products: HoloHctB samples from activity assays were pooled, buffer exchanged into HEPES/NaOH (20 mm, pH 7.5), and concentrated to ~1 mm. Acyl-moiety cleavage from the enzyme ACP domain was accomplished by incubating (30 8C, 350 rpm, overnight) with thioesterase TycF[17] (15\u201330 mm). Precipi-tated protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to a VivaSpin 500 centrifugal filter (Sartorius) and the fil-trate, which contained the cleaved carbonic acid, was collected. Samples for 13C NMR analysis were supplemented with deuterium oxide (10 %). HPLC-MS analysis: Reaction products (cleaved from the enzyme) and standard solutions of hexanoic acid, 5-oxo-hexanoic acid, and 6-chloro hexanoic acid were acidified with formic acid (FA; 1 %, v/ v). HPLC analysis was performed with a 1200 Infinity Series system (Agilent Technologies) and a LiChroCART Purospher STAR column (Merck Millipore; 30 8C, 0.8 mL minNone1) with FA (1 % in water; solvent A) and FA (1 % in acetonitrile; solvent B): 10 % B (10 min), 10\u201350 % B (30 min), 50\u201390 % B (1 min), 90 % B (3 min), 90\u201310 % (1 min), 10 % B (10 min). Separated components were analyzed by ESI-MS single ion monitoring (SIM) in a negative ion detection mode. Synthesis of [13C6]-labeled acyl-CoA: The synthesis of [ 13C6]hexan-oyl-CoA was from commercially available [13C6]hexan-1-ol (Sigma\u2013 Aldrich). A microscale model synthesis was developed first with unlabeled hexan-1-ol. [13C6]Hexanoyl-CoA was obtained in a total yield of 36 % by oxidation of [13C6]hexan-1-ol [30] and subsequent en-hanced S-acylation to CoA by a published method[18] with PyBOP as the coupling agent (Scheme S1). NMR analysis: 13C-labeled enzyme\u2013product complexes and hydro-lyzed reaction products were analyzed on an Avance III 700 MHz NMR spectrometer (298 K; Bruker) equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryo probe. For the one-dimensional 13C NMR spectra, 16 384 scans were acquired in 8.5 h; 1H,13C HSQCs were recorded with 16 scans for each of the 128 increments. For INADEQUATE spectra, 512 scans were accumulated for each of the 64 transients. HctB structural modeling and in silico docking: A structural model of the HoloHctB halogenase and ACP domains was generat-ed by a combination of in silico docking and MD simulations (see the Supporting Information).",
