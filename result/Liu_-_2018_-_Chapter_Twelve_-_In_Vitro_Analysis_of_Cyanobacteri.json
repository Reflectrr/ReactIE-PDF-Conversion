Outlook 399 Acknowledgments 401 References 401 Abstract Aliphatic carbon\u2013halogen (C\u2013X) bonds are prevalent in modern pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Three distinct chemical strategies are known in Nature to generate these structural motifs. The first is via the nucleophilic substitution at a pre-functionalized electrophilic carbon center with a halide anion (XNone), known for the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent halogenases. The second is via the electrophilic activation of an alkene or its equivalent by a halenium ion (X+) donor, known for the haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases. The third is via the direct func-tionalization of an unactivated aliphatic C\u2013H bond with a halogen radical (X%) equiva-lent, known for the 2-oxo-glutarate and nonheme iron-dependent halogenases. Due to the ubiquitous nature of aliphatic C\u2013H groups in organic molecules, transformations that permit chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selective modification(s) at an unactivated sp3-carbon center have been a long sought-after goal in chemical science. Two nonheme iron-dependent halogenases, WelO5 and AmbO5 involved in the biogenesis of cyanobacterial hapalindole-type alkaloids, have been recently shown able to perform this type of chal-lenging transformation. In this chapter, experimental details for the in vitro reconstitution of WelO5 and AmbO5 enzymatic activities are presented. Methods in Enzymology, Volume 604 # 2018 Elsevier Inc.

INTRODUCTION Carbon\u2013halogen (C\u2013X)bonds are prevalent structural motifs inmodern pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (Smith, Eastman, & Njardarson, 2014). Natural products containing this type of functional group, once considered as the \u201cchance products of Nature\u201d (Petty, 1961), are now known ubiquitous across all domains of life with nearly 5000 members isolated and characterized to date (Gribble, 2010). Over the past two decades, significant progresses have been made in delineating Nature\u2019s logics for the enzymatic C\u2013X bond formations. These advances, along with their historical perspective, have been recently systematically reviewed (Agarwal et al., 2017; Vaillancourt, Yeh, Vosburg, Garneau-Tsodikova, & Walsh, 2006) and will not be discussed in detail in this chapter. Aliphatic C\u2013X bonds, distinct from those with halogens attached to an sp2-or sp-hybridized carbon center, are widely present in naturally occurring halometabolites (Fig. 1; Gribble, 2010). The attachment of a halogen atom to an sp3-hybridized carbon center profoundly alters its reactivity, notably its electrophilicity. Thus, this type of modification often plays an important role in the bioactivity of halogenated natural products (Williams et al., 2005). The logics underlying the formation of an aliphatic C\u2013Xbond in natural product biosynthesis encompass all the key chemical prin-ciples established for the enzymatic C\u2013Xbond formation (Agarwal et al., 2017; Vaillancourt et al., 2006). These principles are briefly outlined here.

This type of aliphatic C\u2013X bonds originates primarily from an sp2-hybridized carbon, amenable for activation by a halenium ion (X+) donor that is generated oxidatively from a halide anion (XNone) by a haloperoxidase or a flavin-dependent halogenase. A notable example is the aliphatic C\u2013Br bond formation in the biogenesis of \u03b1-snyderol from (E)-(+)-nerolidol by a vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase (Fig. 2A; Carter-Franklin & Butler, 2004). Related mechanisms that involve the activation of an electron-rich sp2-hybridized carbon with an enzymatically generated X+ donorhavebeencited for thealiphaticC\u2013Clbondformations in thebiosynthesis of caldariomycin and chloramphenicol, where the former requires a heme-dependent chloroperoxidase (Sundaramoorthy, Terner, & Poulos, 1995) and the latter calls for a flavin-dependent halogenase (Podzelinska et al., 2010).

When this substitution occurs on the activated methyl group of SAM, a halomethane, the simplest naturally occurring halometa-bolite, is generated and the corresponding enzyme is also known as the SAM-dependent halide methyltransferase (Wuosmaa & Hager, 1990). Alternatively, when the substitution occurs on the 50 carbon of adenosine in SAM, a 50-halo-50-deoxyadenosine is generated as an intermediate for the downstream biosynthetic maturations. SalL, one of the two well-characterized SAM-dependent halogenases, catalyzes the formation of 50-chloro-50-deoxyadenosine en route to the biosynthesis of salinospora-mide A (Fig. 2B; Eustaquio, Pojer, Noel, & Moore, 2008). The third major enzymatic strategy for introducing aliphatic C\u2013X bonds into halogenated natural product is via the direct modification of an aliphatic carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2013H) bond with a halogen radical (X%) equivalent, manifested by the nonheme iron-dependent halogenases. These halogenases constitute an important subset of a widespread family of oxygenases that combine reaction of O2 at an H\u2013X\u2013D/E\u2026H-coordinated mononuclear Fe(II) center with oxidative decarboxylation of a coordinated 2-oxo-glutarate (2OG) cofactor (Hausinger & Schofield, 2015). These enzymes generate an iron(IV)-oxo (FeIV]O) (ferryl) intermediate, a common mechanistic theme in all Fe/2OG enzymes, to initiate reaction with substrate by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (H%) (Krebs, Galonic Fujimori, Walsh, & Bollinger, 2007). SyrB2, from the syringomycin biosynthetic pathway inPseudomonas syringae, is the first biochemically characterized Fe/2OG halogenase (Vaillancourt, Yin, &Walsh, 2005). It monochlorinates the C4 methyl group in L-threonine covalently tethered as a thioester to the phosphopantetheine arm of its carrier protein, SyrB1 (Fig. 2C; Vaillancourt, Yin, et al., 2005). The X-ray crystal structure of Fe(II)None2OG SyrB2 with ClNone (but in the absence of substrate, the threonine-appended carrier protein SyrB1) gave the first mechanistic insight into Fe/2OG-mediated halogenation (Blasiak, Vaillancourt, Walsh, & Drennan, 2006). Omission of the carboxylate ligand in the H-X-D/E\u2026H motif via mutation to an Ala residue opens an Fe(II) coordination position that can be occupied by the halogen. Thus, the SyrB2 reaction proceeds by the same general pathway as Fe/2OG hydroxylases, involving a cis-halo-ferryl inter-mediate to abstract an H% from C4 of the tethered threonine, then coupling the substrate carbon radical with the chlorine ligand instead of the hydroxyl ligand of the resultant Cl\u2013Fe(III)\u2013OH complex (Matthews, Krest, et al., 2009). 392 Xinyu Liu Due to the ubiquitous nature of aliphatic C\u2013Hgroups in organic molecules, transformations that permit chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selective modification(s) at an unactivated sp3-carbon center have been a long sought-after goal in chemical science (White, 2012). The discovery of SyrB2-type nonheme iron halogenases, widely present in the biosynthetic pathways for polyketide and nonribosomal peptide natural products (Galonic, Vaillancourt, & Walsh, 2006; Gu et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011; Neumann & Walsh, 2008; Ueki et al., 2006; Vaillancourt, Yeh, Vosburg, O\u2019Connor, &Walsh, 2005), immedi-ately raised the question whether they can be applied to biocatalytic processes. Moreover, theSyrB2crystal structure seemingly suggests aminimalmodification in the H-X-D/E\u2026H Fe(II)-binding motif constitutes a key for the ferryl complex to promote chlorine transfer. This raised another intriguing question on whether this finding can be universally translated to the superfamily of FeII/2OG enzymes simply by deletion of the carboxylate ligand to accommo-date a more diverse set of substrates. Unfortunately, neither was the case. SyrB2-type halogenases strictly require the small-molecular substrate tethered to a carried protein (Galonic et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011; Neumann & Walsh, 2008; Ueki et al., 2006; Vaillancourt, Yeh, et al., 2005; Vaillancourt, Yin, et al., 2005). Efforts to reprogram Fe/2OG hydroxylases by single-site substitution of the D/E in the H-X-D/E\u2026H motif have not met with success (Gorres, Pua, & Raines, 2009; Grzyska, Muller, Campbell, & Hausinger, 2007). Even the restoration of the H-X-D/E\u2026H motif in SyrB2 did not yield a competent enzyme for hydroxylation (Matthews, Neumann, et al., 2009). These data collectively suggest the challenging nature to utilize SyrB2-type halogenases for biocatalytic applications. WelO5, from the welwitindolinone biosynthetic pathway inHapalosiphon welwitschii (Hillwig, Fuhrman, et al., 2014; Hillwig, Zhu, & Liu, 2014), is the first biochemically characterized Fe/2OG halogenase that can act on free-standing small molecules independent of carrier proteins (Hillwig & Liu,2014).WelO5preferentiallymonochlorinatesC13of12-epi-fischerindole U to yield 12-epi-fischerindole G (Fig. 2D) and is also able to convert 12-epi-hapalindoleC to 12-epi-hapalindole E at a reduced efficiency (Fig. 3). A related halogenase AmbO5 (79% sequence identical toWelO5), from the ambiguine biosynthetic pathway in Fischerella ambigua (Hillwig, Zhu, et al., 2014), has been shown able to accommodate seven structurally distinct hapalindole-type alkaloids (Fig. 3; Hillwig, Zhu, Ittiamornkul, & Liu, 2016). In addition, the restoration of the H-X-D\u2026Hmotif in WelO5 generates a catalytically com-petent hydroxylase WelO5(G166D) (Fig. 4A), suggesting a unique active site dynamics may be operant that is distinct from SyrB2.

Mitchell et al., 2016) provided structural corroborations with the in vitro biochemical characteristics of WelO5 and AmbO5 (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Hillwig et al., 2016; Zhu & Liu, 2017). This led to the identification of an external \u03b1-helical motif that defines the small-molecular substrate-binding pocket. Moreover, the WelO5 structure revealed that the target C13 of 12-epi-fischerindole U is naturally poised for hydroxylation in the active site (Fig. 4B), and the selective chlorine transfer is likely dictated by a previously unknown second sphere serine residue that helps control the geometry of the reactive Cl\u2013Fe(IV)]O and Cl\u2013Fe(III)\u2013OH intermediates in the WelO5 catalytic cycle (Fig. 4). The structural characterization of WelO5 further led to the identification of an Fe/2OG hydroxylase (SadA) that can be readily engineered to gain halogenase activity (Mitchell et al., 2017). Together with the identification of additional WelO5-type halogenase that may mediate late-stage chlorinations beyond the hapalindole-type scaffolds (Moosmann et al., 2017), a promising future can be forecasted for engineering this family of enzymes for selective functionalization of aliphatic C\u2013H groups with halogens in a diverse set of molecular scaffolds. 2. IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF WelO5 AND AmbO5 HALOGENASES As for any given in vitro enzyme reconstitution, its success requires three key procedural components that are indispensable from each other: (1) the ability to procure sufficient quantity of the target enzyme, (2) the ability to procure sufficient quantity of the presumptive substrate(s) for the target enzyme, and (3) analytical procedures to assess the turnover of the substrate(s) by the target enzyme and to define the molecular nature of the enzymatic product. The following subsections detail my laboratory\u2019s experience on these three parts for WelO5 and AmbO5 halogenases. 2.1 Purification of WelO5 and AmbO5 Proteins Genes (870bp) encoding WelO5 and AmbO5 proteins can be readily ampli-fied by PCR from the genomic DNA of H. welwitschii UTEX B 1830 and F. ambiguaUTEX 1903, respectively. Both strains are available at the Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (https://utex.org). Alternatively, these sequences (GenBank ID: AHI58816 for WelO5 and AKP23998 for AmbO5) can be synthesized by any reputable company offer-ing a synthetic gene service. Codon optimization is not required, as the native sequences lead to an appreciable amount of soluble proteins in Escherichia coli 395Cyanobacterial Nonheme Iron-Dependent Aliphatic Halogenases (vide infra), sufficient for in vitro biochemical and structural studies. The pQTEV plasmid, available at Addgene (https://www.addgene.org/31291/), has been the vector of choice by my laboratory to clone the welO5 and ambO5 genes. These constructs gave the N-His7-tagged WelO5 and AmbO5 pro-teins upon overexpression in E. coli. Any other conventional cloning vectors that carry N-terminal His-Tag sequence, such as pET22 or pET28 plasmids, should perform equally well as the pQTEV. Site-directed mutagenesis can be routinely performed on the WelO5 and AmbO5 proteins readily once their expression constructs are generated using a PCR-based approach, of which details will not be included here. The following protocol describes a purifica-tion procedure for the WelO5 protein, which is equally applicable to the AmbO5 protein as well as their mutant proteins. Day 1: Transform a pQTEVplasmidwith thewelO5 gene cloned between the BamHI and NotI sites to electro-or chemically competent C43 (DE3) or BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. Day 2 evening: Pick a single colony of C43 (DE3) or BL21(DE3) E. coli cells with the pQTEV::welO5 plasmid and prepare a starter culture by inoc-ulating the picked colony to a 5-mL LB culture overnight at 30\u00b0C. Day 3 morning: Inoculate 1mL of the starter culture to a 2.8-L Fernbach flask containing 1L of LB medium with 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin. Grow the cultures at 37\u00b0C to an optical density of approximately 0.6, then drop the temperature to 16\u00b0C. Add isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1mM, final concentration) to induce protein expression. Day 4 morning: Pellet the cells from the 1-L overnight culture by cen-trifugation at 8800None g for 20min. Resuspend the cell pellets in a 10-mL protein lysis buffer (50mM Tris/pH 7.4, 500mM NaCl, 20mM imidazole, 10mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Tween-20) and perform cell lysis by sonicating on ice in a 10-s interval for 3min and then pellet the cell debris by centrifugation at 20,000None g and 4\u00b0C for 30min. Transfer the cleared lysate to a 2-mL prewashed Ni-NTA bead (Qiagen) slurry and incubate for 1h at 4\u00b0C. Thereafter, load the Ni-NTA beads on to a column and wash with 60mL of binding buffer (50mM Tris/pH 7.4, 500mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 20mM imidazole, 10mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). The His-tagged WelO5 protein will be eluted by adding 5mL of elution buffer (50mMTris/ pH 7.4, 500mM NaCl, 100 then 250mM imidazole, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) to the bead bed. The eluted protein will be subjected to a dialysis at 4\u00b0C using a 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane (Spectrum Laboratory Products) with a buffer containing 50mMHEPES (pH 7.4), 10mM EDTA, 10mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5mM DTT. This initial dialysis can be 396 Xinyu Liu carried overnight and ensures the complete removal of metal ions in the eluted protein sample post-Ni-NTA column. Day 5 morning: The WelO5 protein sample postdialysis against EDTA will be subjected to a second round of dialysis with a buffer containing 50mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5mM DTT to remove EDTA. This dialysis step to remove EDTA is recommend to be repeated one more time before the sample is concentrated with an Amicon MWCO 10 centrifugal filter. The WelO5 protein purified by the procedure described earlier is sufficiently pure for in vitro reconstitution experiment. Its purity can be judged by routine SDS-PAGE analysis, and its concentration can be estimated either using a UV\u2013vis spectrometer or the colormetric Bradford assay. Note: Literature describing the in vitro reconstitution of several carrier protein-dependent nonheme iron halogenases (Galonic et al., 2006; Vaillancourt, Yeh, et al., 2005; Vaillancourt, Yin, et al., 2005), including a protocol chapter in this book series (van Pee, 2012), has indicated that these proteins need to be purified in the absence of air. These observations are counterintuitive to the facts that these proteins are oxygenases and require molecular oxygen for their activities. My laboratory and others have inde-pendently validated (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Matthews, Krest, et al., 2009), as the protocol described earlier, that these halogenases can be routinely puri-fied in an atmospheric environment. The key to obtain consistently active proteins is to ensure the metal ions are completely stripped off from the pro-tein initially by a dialysis against EDTA. 2.2 Procurement of Substrates for WelO5 and AmbO5 Proteins Seven hapalindole-type alkaloids (Figs. 2D and 3) have been validated as the native substrates for WelO5 and/or AmbO5 halogenases (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Hillwig et al., 2016). These alkaloids can be procured via three differ-ent routes. The first is via isolation from their native cyanobacterial pro-ducers (Smitka et al., 1992; Stratmann et al., 1994), which have been practiced by my laboratory for several years and a sample protocol will be provided here. The second is via de novo organic synthesis. Synthetic routes that consist of less than 10 steps from commercially available building blocks have been established for 12-epi-fischerindole U, 12-epi-hapalindole C, and hapalindole U (Baran, Maimone, & Richter, 2007; Baran &Richter, 2004). These synthetic advancements rendered the custom synthesis as a viable third option to procure these molecules. For example, 12-epi-hapalindole 397Cyanobacterial Nonheme Iron-Dependent Aliphatic Halogenases Cwas known accessible in an estimated cost of 5000USD/g via custom syn-thesis (2015 data, personal communication with the Biocatalysis group of Novartis AG, Basel, CH). Described below is an exemplary protocol for the isolation of 12-epi-ficherindole U from H. welwitschii UTEX B 1830. Step 1: Culture H. welwitschiiUTEX B 1830 at a 20-L scale at room tem-perature in BG-11 medium (for recipe, see https://utex.org/products/bg-11-medium) with a 12h/12h light/dark cycle for approximately 5 weeks. Step 2: Harvest the algal cells by filtration and then lyophilize. This typically yields 5\u20136g of freeze-dried material. Step 3: Extract the lyophilized tissue with CH2Cl2/MeOH (v/v\u00bc1:1, 50mL) overnight with stirring at room temperature. The crude organic extract postfiltration will be dried under reduced pressure and redissolved in methanol (15mL). This methanol solution will be filtered through an organic solvent compatible syringe filter and injected on to a Phenomenex Luna C18 21.5None20mm reversed phase preparative HPLC column for initial crude separation of hapalindole-type compounds using a gradient from 50% to 100% methanol in water over 100min. Step 4: The fractions that contain 12-epi-ficherindole U from the prepar-ative HPLC run will need to be pooled, dried, and redissolved in methanol and subjected to another round of fine purification by HPLC. This second round HPLC is typically done via a C18 Luna Phenomenex 250None4.6mm column with a gradient from 50% to 80% acetonitrile in water over 35min and aUV detector wavelength set at 280nm. This procedure typically results in 0.2\u20131mg of 12-epi-ficherindole U from a 20-L cyanobacterial culture. The authenticity of 12-epi-ficherindole U will need to be verified by a 1H NMR analysis in comparison with literature data (Stratmann et al., 1994). This NMR analysis step is critical, in particular for the first-time practitioner of this protocol, as H. welwitschii UTEX B 1830 produces several isomers of 12-epi-ficherindole U that cannot be readily distinguished by UV and mass spec analyses alone. 2.3 Activity Assay for WelO5 and AmbO5 Proteins The protocol described here is a standard procedure for the WelO5 wild-type protein using 12-epi-ficherindole U as a substrate. This method can be readily applied to the AmbO5 protein as well as in combination with other substrates. The analytical scale assay (100\u03bcL) is carried out in a 1.8-mL borosilicate glass vial, rather than an Eppendorf tube made of plastic. The reason for this 398 Xinyu Liu is that my laboratory has found hapalindole-type compounds are inherently hydrophobic and tend to \u201cstick\u201d to the plastic surface of some Eppendorf tubes. This makes the subsequent enzymatic product recovery challenging. The metal cofactor Fe(II) is provided in the form of (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2. It is recommended the stock solution of (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 to be made freshly to minimize its deterioration in the air, unless the practitioner\u2019s lab has a glove box to keep this solution. Step 1: All assay components, except the WelO5 protein and Fe(II) salt, are premixed with water to a final volume of 90\u03bcL with their final con-centrations at 100\u03bcL adjusted to the following values: 12-epi-ficherindole U (1mM), 2OG (2mM), NaCl (10mM), andHEPES (pH 7.4, 20mM). This mixture should be briefly purged with nitrogen gas. Step 2: To this initially prepared solution, the WelO5 protein (20\u03bcM, final concentration) and (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 (500\u03bcM, final concentration) are added with a small amount of water to adjust the final volume to 100\u03bcL. The mixture will be briefly incubated under a nitrogen atmosphere before being purged with air and incubated aerobically at 30\u00b0C for 1h. Step 3: The enzymatic assay is stopped by extracting with ethyl acetate (0.5mLNone2) and centrifuged. Ethyl acetate extracts are combined, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and redissolved in methanol (50\u03bcL). A portion of the methanol solution is injected into a C18 Luna Phenomenex 250None4.6mm HPLC column using a mobile phase gradient 50%\u201380% acetonitrile in water over 35min with UV absorption monitoring set at 280nm. Step 4: 12-epi-ficherindole G is less polar than 12-epi-ficherindole U and can be readily identified by examining the HPLC chromatograph. For a first-time practitioner, the standard 12-epi-ficherindole G can be isolated from H. welwitschii UTEX B 1830 using the protocol described in Section 2.2, which can be used as a coelution standard in this assay. The HPLC analysis described in step 3 can be coupled to a MS detector to ascertain the chlorine transfer. To be absolutely certain on the structure of the chlorinated adduct, the enzymatic reaction has to be scaled up proportionally to at least 3mL to allow for the enzymatic product to be isolated by semipreparative HPLC for NMR analysis. 3. OUTLOOK Methods that enable selective intermolecular aliphatic C\u2013H bond functionalization reactions have been long considered a Holy Grail of mod-ern chemical science (Arndtsen, Bergman, Mobley, & Peterson, 1995). Despite the significant progress in this scientific frontier over the past two 399Cyanobacterial Nonheme Iron-Dependent Aliphatic Halogenases decades (Crabtree & Lei, 2017; Davies & Morton, 2017; Goldberg & Goldman, 2017; Hartwig, 2017; He, Wasa, Chan, Shao, & Yu, 2017; McIntosh, Farwell, & Arnold, 2014; Shang, Ilies, & Nakamura, 2017), broadly applicable chemical or enzymatic transformations that allow for the selective modification of an aliphatic C\u2013H bond to a C\u2013X bond in a diverse set of molecules have not yet emerged. The discovery of WelO5-type aliphatic halogenases provides a new platform and opportunity to explore this unmet need. While this statement is likely subject to rebuttals due to the limited currently known substrates of WelO5 and AmbO5 (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Hillwig et al., 2016), several layers of evidence have accumulated over the past 3 years that augments this family of halogenases as a privileged system for biocatalysis development. These evidences address two important issues that often concern practitioners in this field: one is whether this family of halogenase is evolvable and can accept small-molecular substrates beyond hapalindole-type alkaloids; the other is if they are evolvable, then what are the rules? First of all, there is strong evidence that WelO5-type halogenases are naturally evolvable for alternating substrate preferences within the related structural class as well as for completely different structural scaffolds. By char-acterizing three WelO5-type halogenases related to the biosynthesis of hapalindole alkaloids (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Hillwig et al., 2016; Zhu & Liu, 2017), my laboratory has identified a conserved C-terminal amino acid sequence that typically resides at 210\u2013240 residues and is critically important for their substrate scope and tolerance of the identified hapalindole-type sub-strates. This observation corroborates with the substrate-bound X-ray crystal structure of WelO5 (Mitchell et al., 2016). More recently, a WelO5-type halogenase (MstM) was identified in the biosynthetic pathway of an ent-sterol-containing meroterpenoid in the cyanobacterium Scytonema sp. PCC10023 (Moosmann et al., 2017). Although the halogenation timing forMstM remains to be elucidated, the substrate forMstM is likely a steroid-likemolecule, distinct from the hapalindole\u2019s indole monoterpene scaffold. Notably, the sequence of MstM diverges most notably from WelO5 and AmbO5 in the previously identified C-terminal motif that defines the substrate-binding pocket. Second, the X-ray crystal structure characterization of WelO5 discovered a novel structural element for controlling the selective halogen transfer by this family of 2OG/Fe(II) enzymes (Fig. 4) and laid the conceptual ground on how to engineer the broadly available 2OG/Fe(II) hydroxylases to halogenases. As a proof of principle, my laboratory has shown the N-suc-L-leucine hydroxylase SadA (Hibi et al., 2012) can readily gain chlorination activity by a rational engineering approach (Mitchell et al., 2017). This enzyme is now ready 400 Xinyu Liu for lab-based directed evolution to further enhance its halogenation activity. It also offers a quick entry point for many other groups to pursue this goal simultaneously. Overall, with growing microbial genomic data, in particular those related to cyanobacterial organisms (Shih et al., 2013), it is safe to envision more WelO5-type small-molecular aliphatic halogenases will be discovered. The comparativebiochemical and structural characterizationsof thesenewenzymes will provideus a better andmoreconcretepicture onNature\u2019s principle to evo-lve this familyof enzymes for alternative structural scaffolds.This knowledge, in combination with those that will soon be learned from the directed evolution of SadA mutant protein to gain halogenation activity, will undoubtedly guide us synergistically toward a broadly applicable enzymatic system that enables late-stage aliphatic halogenations in small-molecular pharmaceuticals, agri-chemicals, and bioactive natural products.

        "Aliphatic carbon\u2013halogen (C\u2013X) bonds are prevalent in modern pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Three distinct chemical strategies are known in Nature to generate these structural motifs. The first is via the nucleophilic substitution at a pre-functionalized electrophilic carbon center with a halide anion (XNone), known for the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent halogenases. The second is via the electrophilic activation of an alkene or its equivalent by a halenium ion (X+) donor, known for the haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases. The third is via the direct func-tionalization of an unactivated aliphatic C\u2013H bond with a halogen radical (X%) equiva-lent, known for the 2-oxo-glutarate and nonheme iron-dependent halogenases. Due to the ubiquitous nature of aliphatic C\u2013H groups in organic molecules, transformations that permit chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selective modification(s) at an unactivated sp3-carbon center have been a long sought-after goal in chemical science. Two nonheme iron-dependent halogenases, WelO5 and AmbO5 involved in the biogenesis of cyanobacterial hapalindole-type alkaloids, have been recently shown able to perform this type of chal-lenging transformation. In this chapter, experimental details for the in vitro reconstitution of WelO5 and AmbO5 enzymatic activities are presented.",

        "pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (Smith, Eastman, & Njardarson, 2014). Natural products containing this type of functional group, once considered as the \u201cchance products of Nature\u201d (Petty, 1961), are now known ubiquitous across all domains of life with nearly 5000 members isolated and characterized to date (Gribble, 2010). Over the past two decades, significant progresses have been made in delineating Nature\u2019s logics for the enzymatic C\u2013X bond formations. These advances, along with their historical perspective, have been recently systematically reviewed (Agarwal et al., 2017; Vaillancourt, Yeh, Vosburg, Garneau-Tsodikova, & Walsh, 2006) and will not be discussed in detail in this chapter. Aliphatic C\u2013X bonds, distinct from those with halogens attached to an sp2-or sp-hybridized carbon center, are widely present in naturally occurring halometabolites (Fig. 1; Gribble, 2010). The attachment of a halogen atom to an sp3-hybridized carbon center profoundly alters its reactivity, notably its electrophilicity. Thus, this type of modification often plays an important role in the bioactivity of halogenated natural products (Williams et al., 2005). The logics underlying the formation of an aliphatic C\u2013Xbond in natural product biosynthesis encompass all the key chemical prin-ciples established for the enzymatic C\u2013Xbond formation (Agarwal et al., 2017; Vaillancourt et al., 2006). These principles are briefly outlined here.",

        "Halogenated terpenoids of marine and terrestrial origins represent the largest family of naturally occurring halometabolites with aliphatic C\u2013Cl and C\u2013Br bonds (Gribble, 2010). This type of aliphatic C\u2013X bonds originates primarily from an sp2-hybridized carbon, amenable for activation by a halenium ion (X+) donor that is generated oxidatively from a halide anion (XNone) by a haloperoxidase or a flavin-dependent halogenase. A notable example is the aliphatic C\u2013Br bond formation in the biogenesis of \u03b1-snyderol from (E)-(+)-nerolidol by a vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase (Fig. 2A; Carter-Franklin & Butler, 2004). Related mechanisms that involve the activation of an electron-rich sp2-hybridized carbon with an enzymatically generated X+ donorhavebeencited for thealiphaticC\u2013Clbondformations in thebiosynthesis of caldariomycin and chloramphenicol, where the former requires a heme-dependent chloroperoxidase (Sundaramoorthy, Terner, & Poulos, 1995) and the latter calls for a flavin-dependent halogenase (Podzelinska et al., 2010).",

        "Nucleophilic substitution by a halide anion (XNone) at an activated aliphatic carbon center of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), manifested by the SAM-dependent halogenases, constitutes the second major enzy-matic strategy for introducing aliphatic C\u2013X bonds to the halogenated natural products. When this substitution occurs on the activated methyl group of SAM, a halomethane, the simplest naturally occurring halometa-bolite, is generated and the corresponding enzyme is also known as the SAM-dependent halide methyltransferase (Wuosmaa & Hager, 1990). Alternatively, when the substitution occurs on the 50 carbon of adenosine in SAM, a 50-halo-50-deoxyadenosine is generated as an intermediate for the downstream biosynthetic maturations. SalL, one of the two well-characterized SAM-dependent halogenases, catalyzes the formation of 50-chloro-50-deoxyadenosine en route to the biosynthesis of salinospora-mide A (Fig. 2B; Eustaquio, Pojer, Noel, & Moore, 2008). The third major enzymatic strategy for introducing aliphatic C\u2013X bonds into halogenated natural product is via the direct modification of an aliphatic carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2013H) bond with a halogen radical (X%) equivalent, manifested by the nonheme iron-dependent halogenases. These halogenases constitute an important subset of a widespread family of oxygenases that combine reaction of O2 at an H\u2013X\u2013D/E\u2026H-coordinated mononuclear Fe(II) center with oxidative decarboxylation of a coordinated 2-oxo-glutarate (2OG) cofactor (Hausinger & Schofield, 2015). These enzymes generate an iron(IV)-oxo (FeIV]O) (ferryl) intermediate, a common mechanistic theme in all Fe/2OG enzymes, to initiate reaction with substrate by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (H%) (Krebs, Galonic Fujimori, Walsh, & Bollinger, 2007). SyrB2, from the syringomycin biosynthetic pathway inPseudomonas syringae, is the first biochemically characterized Fe/2OG halogenase (Vaillancourt, Yin, &Walsh, 2005). It monochlorinates the C4 methyl group in L-threonine covalently tethered as a thioester to the phosphopantetheine arm of its carrier protein, SyrB1 (Fig. 2C; Vaillancourt, Yin, et al., 2005). The X-ray crystal structure of Fe(II)None2OG SyrB2 with ClNone (but in the absence of substrate, the threonine-appended carrier protein SyrB1) gave the first mechanistic insight into Fe/2OG-mediated halogenation (Blasiak, Vaillancourt, Walsh, & Drennan, 2006). Omission of the carboxylate ligand in the H-X-D/E\u2026H motif via mutation to an Ala residue opens an Fe(II) coordination position that can be occupied by the halogen. Thus, the SyrB2 reaction proceeds by the same general pathway as Fe/2OG hydroxylases, involving a cis-halo-ferryl inter-mediate to abstract an H% from C4 of the tethered threonine, then coupling the substrate carbon radical with the chlorine ligand instead of the hydroxyl ligand of the resultant Cl\u2013Fe(III)\u2013OH complex (Matthews, Krest, et al., 2009).",
        "392 Xinyu Liu",
        "Due to the ubiquitous nature of aliphatic C\u2013Hgroups in organic molecules, transformations that permit chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selective modification(s) at an unactivated sp3-carbon center have been a long sought-after goal in chemical science (White, 2012). The discovery of SyrB2-type nonheme iron halogenases, widely present in the biosynthetic pathways for polyketide and nonribosomal peptide natural products (Galonic, Vaillancourt, & Walsh, 2006; Gu et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011; Neumann & Walsh, 2008; Ueki et al., 2006; Vaillancourt, Yeh, Vosburg, O\u2019Connor, &Walsh, 2005), immedi-ately raised the question whether they can be applied to biocatalytic processes. Moreover, theSyrB2crystal structure seemingly suggests aminimalmodification in the H-X-D/E\u2026H Fe(II)-binding motif constitutes a key for the ferryl complex to promote chlorine transfer. This raised another intriguing question on whether this finding can be universally translated to the superfamily of FeII/2OG enzymes simply by deletion of the carboxylate ligand to accommo-date a more diverse set of substrates. Unfortunately, neither was the case. SyrB2-type halogenases strictly require the small-molecular substrate tethered to a carried protein (Galonic et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011; Neumann & Walsh, 2008; Ueki et al., 2006; Vaillancourt, Yeh, et al., 2005; Vaillancourt, Yin, et al., 2005). Efforts to reprogram Fe/2OG hydroxylases by single-site substitution of the D/E in the H-X-D/E\u2026H motif have not met with success (Gorres, Pua, & Raines, 2009; Grzyska, Muller, Campbell, & Hausinger, 2007). Even the restoration of the H-X-D/E\u2026H motif in SyrB2 did not yield a competent enzyme for hydroxylation (Matthews, Neumann, et al., 2009). These data collectively suggest the challenging nature to utilize SyrB2-type halogenases for biocatalytic applications.",
        "WelO5, from the welwitindolinone biosynthetic pathway inHapalosiphon welwitschii (Hillwig, Fuhrman, et al., 2014; Hillwig, Zhu, & Liu, 2014), is the first biochemically characterized Fe/2OG halogenase that can act on free-standing small molecules independent of carrier proteins (Hillwig & Liu,2014).WelO5preferentiallymonochlorinatesC13of12-epi-fischerindole U to yield 12-epi-fischerindole G (Fig. 2D) and is also able to convert 12-epi-hapalindoleC to 12-epi-hapalindole E at a reduced efficiency (Fig. 3). A related halogenase AmbO5 (79% sequence identical toWelO5), from the ambiguine biosynthetic pathway in Fischerella ambigua (Hillwig, Zhu, et al., 2014), has been shown able to accommodate seven structurally distinct hapalindole-type alkaloids (Fig. 3; Hillwig, Zhu, Ittiamornkul, & Liu, 2016). In addition, the restoration of the H-X-D\u2026Hmotif in WelO5 generates a catalytically com-petent hydroxylase WelO5(G166D) (Fig. 4A), suggesting a unique active site dynamics may be operant that is distinct from SyrB2.

        "Mitchell et al., 2016) provided structural corroborations with the in vitro biochemical characteristics of WelO5 and AmbO5 (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Hillwig et al., 2016; Zhu & Liu, 2017). This led to the identification of an external \u03b1-helical motif that defines the small-molecular substrate-binding pocket. Moreover, the WelO5 structure revealed that the target C13 of 12-epi-fischerindole U is naturally poised for hydroxylation in the active site (Fig. 4B), and the selective chlorine transfer is likely dictated by a previously unknown second sphere serine residue that helps control the geometry of the reactive Cl\u2013Fe(IV)]O and Cl\u2013Fe(III)\u2013OH intermediates in the WelO5 catalytic cycle (Fig. 4). The structural characterization of WelO5 further led to the identification of an Fe/2OG hydroxylase (SadA) that can be readily engineered to gain halogenase activity (Mitchell et al., 2017). Together with the identification of additional WelO5-type halogenase that may mediate late-stage chlorinations beyond the hapalindole-type scaffolds (Moosmann et al., 2017), a promising future can be forecasted for engineering this family of enzymes for selective functionalization of aliphatic C\u2013H groups with halogens in a diverse set of molecular scaffolds.",

Alternatively, these sequences (GenBank ID: AHI58816 for WelO5 and AKP23998 for AmbO5) can be synthesized by any reputable company offer-ing a synthetic gene service.

The pQTEV plasmid, available at Addgene (https://www.addgene.org/31291/), has been the vector of choice by my laboratory to clone the welO5 and ambO5 genes. These constructs gave the N-His7-tagged WelO5 and AmbO5 pro-teins upon overexpression in E. coli. Any other conventional cloning vectors that carry N-terminal His-Tag sequence, such as pET22 or pET28 plasmids, should perform equally well as the pQTEV. Site-directed mutagenesis can be routinely performed on the WelO5 and AmbO5 proteins readily once their expression constructs are generated using a PCR-based approach, of which details will not be included here. The following protocol describes a purifica-tion procedure for the WelO5 protein, which is equally applicable to the AmbO5 protein as well as their mutant proteins. Day 1: Transform a pQTEVplasmidwith thewelO5 gene cloned between the BamHI and NotI sites to electro-or chemically competent C43 (DE3) or BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. Day 2 evening: Pick a single colony of C43 (DE3) or BL21(DE3) E. coli cells with the pQTEV::welO5 plasmid and prepare a starter culture by inoc-ulating the picked colony to a 5-mL LB culture overnight at 30\u00b0C. Day 3 morning: Inoculate 1mL of the starter culture to a 2.8-L Fernbach flask containing 1L of LB medium with 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin. Grow the cultures at 37\u00b0C to an optical density of approximately 0.6, then drop the temperature to 16\u00b0C. Add isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1mM, final concentration) to induce protein expression. Day 4 morning: Pellet the cells from the 1-L overnight culture by cen-trifugation at 8800None g for 20min. Resuspend the cell pellets in a 10-mL protein lysis buffer (50mM Tris/pH 7.4, 500mM NaCl, 20mM imidazole, 10mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Tween-20) and perform cell lysis by sonicating on ice in a 10-s interval for 3min and then pellet the cell debris by centrifugation at 20,000None g and 4\u00b0C for 30min. Transfer the cleared lysate to a 2-mL prewashed Ni-NTA bead (Qiagen) slurry and incubate for 1h at 4\u00b0C. Thereafter, load the Ni-NTA beads on to a column and wash with 60mL of binding buffer (50mM Tris/pH 7.4, 500mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 20mM imidazole, 10mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol).

The eluted protein will be subjected to a dialysis at 4\u00b0C using a 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane (Spectrum Laboratory Products) with a buffer containing 50mMHEPES (pH 7.4), 10mM EDTA, 10mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5mM DTT.

This dialysis step to remove EDTA is recommend to be repeated one more time before the sample is concentrated with an Amicon MWCO 10 centrifugal filter.

These observations are counterintuitive to the facts that these proteins are oxygenases and require molecular oxygen for their activities. My laboratory and others have inde-pendently validated (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Matthews, Krest, et al., 2009), as the protocol described earlier, that these halogenases can be routinely puri-fied in an atmospheric environment.

Step 1: Culture H. welwitschiiUTEX B 1830 at a 20-L scale at room tem-perature in BG-11 medium (for recipe, see https://utex.org/products/bg-11-medium) with a 12h/12h light/dark cycle for approximately 5 weeks. Step 2: Harvest the algal cells by filtration and then lyophilize. This typically yields 5\u20136g of freeze-dried material. Step 3: Extract the lyophilized tissue with CH2Cl2/MeOH (v/v\u00bc1:1, 50mL) overnight with stirring at room temperature. The crude organic extract postfiltration will be dried under reduced pressure and redissolved in methanol (15mL). This methanol solution will be filtered through an organic solvent compatible syringe filter and injected on to a Phenomenex Luna C18 21.5None20mm reversed phase preparative HPLC column for initial crude separation of hapalindole-type compounds using a gradient from 50% to 100% methanol in water over 100min. Step 4: The fractions that contain 12-epi-ficherindole U from the prepar-ative HPLC run will need to be pooled, dried, and redissolved in methanol and subjected to another round of fine purification by HPLC. This second round HPLC is typically done via a C18 Luna Phenomenex 250None4.6mm column with a gradient from 50% to 80% acetonitrile in water over 35min and aUV detector wavelength set at 280nm. This procedure typically results in 0.2\u20131mg of 12-epi-ficherindole U from a 20-L cyanobacterial culture. The authenticity of 12-epi-ficherindole U will need to be verified by a 1H NMR analysis in comparison with literature data (Stratmann et al., 1994). This NMR analysis step is critical, in particular for the first-time practitioner of this protocol, as H. welwitschii UTEX B 1830 produces several isomers of 12-epi-ficherindole U that cannot be readily distinguished by UV and mass spec analyses alone.",

        "399Cyanobacterial Nonheme Iron-Dependent Aliphatic Halogenases",
        "decades (Crabtree & Lei, 2017; Davies & Morton, 2017; Goldberg & Goldman, 2017; Hartwig, 2017; He, Wasa, Chan, Shao, & Yu, 2017; McIntosh, Farwell, & Arnold, 2014; Shang, Ilies, & Nakamura, 2017), broadly applicable chemical or enzymatic transformations that allow for the selective modification of an aliphatic C\u2013H bond to a C\u2013X bond in a diverse set of molecules have not yet emerged. The discovery of WelO5-type aliphatic halogenases provides a new platform and opportunity to explore this unmet need. While this statement is likely subject to rebuttals due to the limited currently known substrates of WelO5 and AmbO5 (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Hillwig et al., 2016), several layers of evidence have accumulated over the past 3 years that augments this family of halogenases as a privileged system for biocatalysis development. These evidences address two important issues that often concern practitioners in this field: one is whether this family of halogenase is evolvable and can accept small-molecular substrates beyond hapalindole-type alkaloids; the other is if they are evolvable, then what are the rules? First of all, there is strong evidence that WelO5-type halogenases are naturally evolvable for alternating substrate preferences within the related structural class as well as for completely different structural scaffolds. By char-acterizing three WelO5-type halogenases related to the biosynthesis of hapalindole alkaloids (Hillwig & Liu, 2014; Hillwig et al., 2016; Zhu & Liu, 2017), my laboratory has identified a conserved C-terminal amino acid sequence that typically resides at 210\u2013240 residues and is critically important for their substrate scope and tolerance of the identified hapalindole-type sub-strates. This observation corroborates with the substrate-bound X-ray crystal structure of WelO5 (Mitchell et al., 2016). More recently, a WelO5-type halogenase (MstM) was identified in the biosynthetic pathway of an ent-sterol-containing meroterpenoid in the cyanobacterium Scytonema sp. PCC10023 (Moosmann et al., 2017). Although the halogenation timing forMstM remains to be elucidated, the substrate forMstM is likely a steroid-likemolecule, distinct from the hapalindole\u2019s indole monoterpene scaffold. Notably, the sequence of MstM diverges most notably from WelO5 and AmbO5 in the previously identified C-terminal motif that defines the substrate-binding pocket. Second, the X-ray crystal structure characterization of WelO5 discovered a novel structural element for controlling the selective halogen transfer by this family of 2OG/Fe(II) enzymes (Fig. 4) and laid the conceptual ground on how to engineer the broadly available 2OG/Fe(II) hydroxylases to halogenases. As a proof of principle, my laboratory has shown the N-suc-L-leucine hydroxylase SadA (Hibi et al., 2012) can readily gain chlorination activity by a rational engineering approach (Mitchell et al., 2017). This enzyme is now ready",
        "400 Xinyu Liu",
        "for lab-based directed evolution to further enhance its halogenation activity. It also offers a quick entry point for many other groups to pursue this goal simultaneously.",
        "Overall, with growing microbial genomic data, in particular those related to cyanobacterial organisms (Shih et al., 2013), it is safe to envision more WelO5-type small-molecular aliphatic halogenases will be discovered. The comparativebiochemical and structural characterizationsof thesenewenzymes will provideus a better andmoreconcretepicture onNature\u2019s principle to evo-lve this familyof enzymes for alternative structural scaffolds.This knowledge, in combination with those that will soon be learned from the directed evolution of SadA mutant protein to gain halogenation activity, will undoubtedly guide us synergistically toward a broadly applicable enzymatic system that enables late-stage aliphatic halogenations in small-molecular pharmaceuticals, agri-chemicals, and bioactive natural products.",
        "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author is indebted to Dr. Matthew L. Hillwig, who established the protocols in the author\u2019s lab for assessing the enzymatic activity of WelO5 halogenase as described in this chapter.
