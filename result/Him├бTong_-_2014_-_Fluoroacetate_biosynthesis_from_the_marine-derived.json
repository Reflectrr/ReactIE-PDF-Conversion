Fermentation of the organism with inorganic fluoride (2 mM) demonstrated that the organism could biosynthesise fluoroacetate and that fluoro-acetate production is sea-salt dependent. This is the first fluoro-metabolite producing microorganism identified from the marine environment. Organofluorine compounds have been widely exploited by the pharmaceutical industry.1 Well over 20% of current drugs in clinical trials contain a fluorine atom. Fluorinated entities have also found extensive use in agrochemicals and in tuning the properties of performance high-value organic materials.2 In contrast, nature has hardly evolved a biochemistry of fluor-ine, and fluorinated natural products are extremely rare.3 Fluoroacetate 1 is the most ubiquitous fluorometabolite found as a toxic component of many tropical and sub-tropical plants.4 In 1986, a soil bacterium Streptomyces cattleya was shown to have the capacity to produce fluoroacetate 1 and the antibiotic, 4-fluorothreonine 2 when grown in the presence of fluoride ion.5 Subsequently the origin of the fluorometabolites of S. cattleya has been studied and the pathway is shown in Scheme 1.6 Enzymatic C\u2013F bond formation is catalysed by the fluorinase, which converts S-adenosyl-L-methionine 3 to 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine 4. The pathway then progresses through fluororibose phosphate 5 and then fluororibulose phosphate 6. An aldolase catalyses a retro-aldol reaction to generate fluoroacetaldehyde 7, which is processed in two direc-tions; oxidation generates fluoroacetate 1, and a PLP-transaldol-ase enzyme generates 4-fluorothreonine 2.7 Fluorinase genes remain sparse. In 2014, more than a decade after the first identification, we reported and assayed three new fluorinases from two terrestrial actinomycetes (Streptomyces sp. MA37 and Actinoplanes sp. N902-109) and an actinomycete pathogen, Nocardia brasiliensis.8 Streptomyces sp. MA37 produces fluoro-acetate 1 and 4-fluorothreonine 2 in culture and also several unidentified fluorometabolites. N. brasiliensis was unable to produce fluorometabolites under laboratory culture con-ditions, and the Actinoplanes sp. strain, although sequenced, is not available in the public domain to culture. To date the plants and bacteria that produce fluorometabolites are from terrestrial organisms. More than 70% of our planet\u2019s surface is covered by oceans.

Consequently chlorinated natural products domi-nate halogenated marine metabolite isolates.10 In 2003, a series of 5-fluorouracil derivatives was isolated from extracts of the marine sponge Phakellia fusca Schmidt, collected from the South China Sea.11 Considering the direct relationship between these derivatives and the widely-used anticancer drug, it is most likely that the sponge accumulated 5-fluorouracil from indus-trial e\ufb04uent rather than by a de novo fluorination biosynthesis. Here we report that the marine bacterium Streptomyces xinghaiensis NRRL B-24674 is a fluoroacetate 1 producer. A fluorinase gene was identified by genome sequencing of the organism. Fluoroacetate 1 production was observed in culture and was found to require high salinity. S. xinghaiensis NRRL B-24674 was isolated in 2009 from a marine sediment sample around Xinghai Bay, in Dalian, China.12 The strain produces a novel alkaloid which was named xinghaiamine A.14 Due to its unique phenotype, it was subjected to genome sequencing in 2011 (accession no. AFRP01000000).13 Its genome sequence was annotated in the RAST server.15 The length of the deposited sequence is approximately 6.79 Mbp with 2312 contigs. Homologue ana-lysis identified a putative fluorinase gene in the contig with the NCBI access no. (AFRP01002228.1) and the encoded protein sequence shared high sequence identity (84%) with the other four known fluorinases, including a 21 amino acids loop, a unique signature of the fluorination enzymes identified so far (ESI, Fig. S2 and Table S2\u2020). In silico analysis indicated that the fluorinase gene flA4 in S. xinghaiensis is located immediately adjacent to flB4, encoding the second biosynthetic enzyme of the fluoroacetate pathway (Scheme 1), a purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP).16 Unlike the gene arrangement17 in S. cattleya, there is a higher degree of clustering of the genes responsible for fluorometabolite biosynthesis in the more recently identified organisms. For example the genes encoding the 4-fluorothreonine transaldolase (4-FTase) are located very close to their respective flA homologues only in these latter cases.8,21 4-FTase is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) enzyme responsible for the last step in 4-fluorothreonine biosynthesis and it appears to contain two domains, the larger one most closely related to a PLP-dependent serine hydroxymethyl trans-ferase (SHMT) motif and the smaller to an epimerase, suggesting that the observed transaldolase activity has evolved from a hybrid construction of two historical activities.18 A flFT knockout in S. cattleya resulted in a mutant able only to produce fluoroacetate 1, which validated its role in 4-fluoro-threonine 2 biosynthesis.22 In S. xinghaiensis there is a trun-cated flFT transaldolase with only 96 amino acids in length lying adjacent to the flA gene which shares a very high seq-uence identity (70%) only with the epimerase motif of the other 4-FTases.18 Two thirds of the gene seems to be missing and it has no SHMT or PLP binding motif so clearly could not carry out the transaldolase reaction to generate 4-fluorothreonine 2. We are also able to identify three candidate fluoroacetate 1 bio-synthetic genes, those encoding a methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase, a fructose aldolase and an alcohol dehydrogenase in the genome of S. xinghaiensis. They are not located particularly close to flA4, however this is also the case in S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37. To investigate further, S. xinghaiensis was grown in shake flask culture supplemented with fluoride (2 mM) in fresh water. It did not behave like other Streptomyces in typical Strep-tomyces media such as International Streptomyces Protocol (ISP) 2 to 7 and Starch Casein medium and failed to produce healthy cell mass. No organofluorine signal was observed in 19F NMR in these samples. However when the medium was supplemented with artificial sea salt (30 g L-1) a healthy growth was established suggesting a sea salt dependency for this marine bacterium. The supernatant\u00a7 of a 10-day culture was analysed by 19F{1H}-NMR. The organism produced fluoro-acetate 1 (-217.44 ppm, t, 2JHF = 47.8 Hz) as a sole fluoro-metabolite (Fig. 2). The concentration of 1 rose to \u223c1 mM after 19-d fermentation using a known concentration of an added fluoromethyl containing reference (5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032deoxy-adenosine) to the NMR sample (ESI, Fig. S4\u2020). The ability of S. xinghaiensis to elaborate fluoroacetate 1 suggests that the identified biosynthetic cluster plays a similar role to the one in S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37. The absence of any 4-fluorothreonine 2 is consistent with the truncated flFT4 gene but its role is unclear. To the left of the flFT4 gene (Fig. 1) are four genes encoding putative auxiliary functions, including DNA regulation ( flF, G and I homologues), and transporter functions ( flH homo-logues), which are also highly conserved in the genes clustered around flA in all other fluorinase containing organisms (S. catt-leya, Streptomyces sp. MA37, N. brasiliensis and Actinoplanes sp.). Interestingly, the translated sequence of the FlF4 transpor-ter is shortened to only 119 amino acids in length compared to the corresponding one in S. cattleya of 185 amino acids. To the right of the flA gene (Fig. 1) are two genes encoding puta-tive auxiliary functions. In S. cattleya, their homologous are orfA and orfB, which are situated adjacent to flFT on a mega-plasmid and very remote from the fluorinase gene flA which is located on the chromosome. OrfA homologues belong to a superfamily of drug metabolite transporter proteins and they share a high sequence identity (47%) with ORF1 involved in the biosynthesis of 4-chlorothreonine in Streptomyces sp. OH-5093.19 At one end of the cluster is flK4 coding for a fluoroacetyl-CoA thioesterase (70% sequence identity to flK in S. cattleya). The flK gene is thought to confer resistance to fluoroacetate cytotoxicity.17 The encoded fluoroacetyl-CoA thioesterase FlK efficiently hydrolyse fluoroacetyl-CoA over acetyl CoA, prevent-ing the conversion of fluoroacetyl-CoA to the respiratory toxin fluorocitrate.20 In the case of S. xinghaiensis, the flK4 gene is also in close proximity to the corresponding flA4 gene, consist-ent with a toxicity resistance role. To explore a link between flK4 and fluoroacetate 1 biosynthesis an in-frame gene deletion of flK4 was conducted using a temperature-dependent suicidal plasmid pKC1139. About two 2-kbp sequences flanking both sides of flK4 gene were amplified and cloned into pKC1139. The construct was introduced into S. xinghaiensis through con-Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry Communication This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 Org. Biomol.

Conclusions In silico analysis has indicated that the marine-derived actino-mycete, Streptomyces xinghaiensis, contains similar genes to those in S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37 for the bio-synthesis of fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine.

Production of fluoroacetate is sea-salt dependent. Inactivation of the flK4, the putative resist-ance gene to fluoroacetate toxicity, encoding a fluoroacetyl-CoA thioesterase, resulted in the loss of fluoroacetate production, and re-insertion of the gene restored its production. This is the first micro-organism from the marine environment shown to produce a fluorometabolite in culture.

The supernatant\u00a7 of a 10-day culture was analysed by 19F{1H}-NMR. The organism produced fluoro-acetate 1 (-217.44 ppm, t, 2JHF = 47.8 Hz) as a sole fluoro-metabolite (Fig. 2). The concentration of 1 rose to \u223c1 mM after 19-d fermentation using a known concentration of an added fluoromethyl containing reference (5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032deoxy-adenosine) to the NMR sample (ESI, Fig. S4\u2020). The ability of S. xinghaiensis to elaborate fluoroacetate 1 suggests that the identified biosynthetic cluster plays a similar role to the one in S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp. MA37. The absence of any 4-fluorothreonine 2 is consistent with the truncated flFT4 gene but its role is unclear. To the left of the flFT4 gene (Fig. 1) are four genes encoding putative auxiliary functions, including DNA regulation ( flF, G and I homologues), and transporter functions ( flH homo-logues), which are also highly conserved in the genes clustered around flA in all other fluorinase containing organisms (S. catt-leya, Streptomyces sp. MA37, N. brasiliensis and Actinoplanes sp.). Interestingly, the translated sequence of the FlF4 transpor-ter is shortened to only 119 amino acids in length compared to the corresponding one in S. cattleya of 185 amino acids. To the right of the flA gene (Fig. 1) are two genes encoding puta-tive auxiliary functions. In S. cattleya, their homologous are orfA and orfB, which are situated adjacent to flFT on a mega-plasmid and very remote from the fluorinase gene flA which is located on the chromosome. OrfA homologues belong to a superfamily of drug metabolite transporter proteins and they share a high sequence identity (47%) with ORF1 involved in the biosynthesis of 4-chlorothreonine in Streptomyces sp. OH-5093.19 At one end of the cluster is flK4 coding for a fluoroacetyl-CoA thioesterase (70% sequence identity to flK in S. cattleya). The flK gene is thought to confer resistance to fluoroacetate cytotoxicity.17 The encoded fluoroacetyl-CoA thioesterase FlK efficiently hydrolyse fluoroacetyl-CoA over acetyl CoA, prevent-ing the conversion of fluoroacetyl-CoA to the respiratory toxin fluorocitrate.20 In the case of S. xinghaiensis, the flK4 gene is also in close proximity to the corresponding flA4 gene, consist-ent with a toxicity resistance role. To explore a link between flK4 and fluoroacetate 1 biosynthesis an in-frame gene deletion of flK4 was conducted using a temperature-dependent suicidal plasmid pKC1139. About two 2-kbp sequences flanking both sides of flK4 gene were amplified and cloned into pKC1139. The construct was introduced into S. xinghaiensis through con-",

        "Conclusions In silico analysis has indicated that the marine-derived actino-mycete, Streptomyces xinghaiensis, contains similar genes to those in S. cattleya and Streptomyces sp.

However the cluster in S. xinghaiensis had a truncated transaldolase ana-logous to that involved in the last step of 4-fluorothreonine bio-synthesis in the other two organisms.

Inactivation of the flK4, the putative resist-ance gene to fluoroacetate toxicity, encoding a fluoroacetyl-CoA thioesterase, resulted in the loss of fluoroacetate production, and re-insertion of the gene restored its production.
