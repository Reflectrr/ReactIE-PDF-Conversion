For a number of such compounds, halogenated congeners have been reported along with nonhalogenated ones. In the present study, chlorinated cyanopeptolin-and/or aeruginosin-type peptides were detected by mass spectrometry in 17 out of 28 axenic strains of Microcystis. In these strains, a halogenase gene was identified between 2 genes coding for NRPS modules in respective gene clusters, whereas it was consistently absent when the strains produced only nonchlorinated corresponding congeners. Nucleotide sequences were obtained for 12 complete halogenase genes and 14 intermodule regions of gene clusters lacking a halogenase gene or containing only fragments of it. When a halogenase gene was found absent, a specific, identical excision pattern was observed for both synthetase gene clusters in most strains. A phylogenetic analysis including other bacterial halogenases showed that the NRPS-related halogenases of Microcystis form a monophyletic group divided into 2 subgroups, corresponding to either the cyanopeptolin or the aeruginosin peptide synthetases. The distribution of these peptide synthetase gene clusters, among the tested Microcystis strains, was found in relative agreement with their phylogeny reconstructed from 16S\u201323S rDNA intergenic spacer sequences, whereas the distribution of the associated halogenase genes appears to be sporadic. The presented data suggest that in cyanobacteria these prevalent halogenase genes originated from an ancient horizontal gene transfer followed by duplication in the cyanobacterial lineage. We propose an evolutionary scenario implying repeated gene losses to explain the distribution of halogenase genes in 2 NRPS gene clusters that subsequently defines the seemingly erratic production of halogenated and nonhalogenated aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins among Microcystis strains. Introduction Cyanobacteria are a rich source of structurally diverse oligopeptides that are predominantly synthesized by nonri-bosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). In Microcystis, a common genus in eutrophic freshwaters, numerous bio-active peptides have been identified that can be mostly classified as aeruginosins, microginins, microcystins, cya-nopeptolins, and anabaenopeptins (Welker and von Do\u0308hren 2006). One intriguing property of these peptides is their structural diversity, achieved either by variability of amino acid moieties in particular positions or by modifications like glycosylation, sulfatation, methylation, or halogenation (Ishida et al. 1999, 2007; Rouhiainen et al. 2000; von Elert et al. 2005) giving rise to virtually hundreds of congeners in each peptide class. The potential of Microcystis to produce a multitude of chlorinated peptides has been recognized in chemotyping studies of natural populations (Welker et al. 2006). Halogenated congeners have mainly been found among aeruginosin-, cyanopeptolin-(fig. 1), and microginin-type peptides, so far. It has to be noted that the names \u2018\u2018aerugino-sin\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018cyanopeptolin\u2019\u2019 refer to peptide types with unique features (see fig. 1) regardless whether individual peptide structures have been named differently. Cyanopeptolin-type peptides, for example, have been named cyanopeptolins, anabaenopeptilides, microcystilide, aeruginopeptins, or os-cillapeptins in the original publications (for a review, see Welker and von Do\u0308hren 2006). Cyanopeptolin-type pepti-des have been reported from distant cyanobacterial taxa be-longing to the Orders Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales (Welker and von Do\u0308hren 2006). Most structural variants inhibit serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase) by preventing the hydrolytic attack on substrates by covering the active center with the rigid ring structure (Matern et al. 2003). Many structural variants of aerugino-sins have been reported from Microcystis (Chroococcales) and Planktothrix (Oscillatoriales). Aeruginosins have also been shown to inhibit serine proteases, especially thrombin (Ishida et al. 1999). Despite the ubiquitous presence of these peptides (and others) in natural cyanobacterial consortia, a consistent hypothesis explaining their function in produc-ing cells has not yet been proposed. In microginins, linear tetra-or pentapeptides, chlorina-tion occurs at an N-terminal aliphatic moiety (a modified decanoic acid) (Ishida et al. 1998), whereas in aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins, chlorination occurs at aromatic moie-ties. Expectedly, halogenating enzymes differ for these 2 types of chlorination. Aliphatic halogenation has been re-ported for the barbamide biosynthesis pathway of Lyngbya majuscula (Sitachitta et al. 2000), where a chlorine is transferred to a native leucine during biosynthesis by a nonheme FeII halogenase (Galonic et al. 2006). A sim-ilar enzyme has been reported for the syringomycin bio-synthesis in Pseudomonas syringae (Vaillancourt et al. 2005). Halogenation on aromatic moieties is thought to be catalyzed primarily by FADH2-dependent halogenases (Vaillancourt et al. 2006; van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006). In Microcystis, mono-or dichlorination of aeruginosins 1 Present address: Anagnostec GmbH, Am Mu\u0308hlenberg 11, Potsdam, Germany.

Monochlorination in cyanopeptolins is reported for an N-methylated tyrosine or homotyrosine, respectively (Rouhiainen et al. 2000; von Elert et al. 2005). A number of studies reported the presence and func-tion of enzymes responsible for the halogenation of second-ary metabolites of pharmaceutical interest, such as pentachloropseudilin (Wynands and van Pe\u0301e 2004), cloro-biocin (Eusta\u0301quio et al. 2003), pyrrolnitrin (Keller et al. 2000), or pyoluteorin (Dorrestein et al. 2005). Mechanistic studies indicated that chlorination is regioselective either on free substrates, like during pyrrolnitrin or rebeccamycin synthesis (Dong et al. 2005; Yeh et al. 2005), or while in-termediates are tethered to NRPS enzymes like during clor-obiocin or pyoluteorin synthesis (Eusta\u0301quio et al. 2003; Dorrestein et al. 2005). These studies suggest that specific halogenase genes are closely associated to particular NRPS gene clusters and that halogenase genes may be absent or dysfunctional in strains producing nonchlorinated peptide congeners that are very similar to chlorinated ones. An initial mass spectrometrical screening of axenic Microcystis strains revealed the presence of aeruginosins and/or cyanopeptolins, both chlorinated and nonchlori-nated. This raised the question whether the distribution of chlorinated congeners correlates with the presence of halogenase genes in corresponding NRPS operons that have been characterized for several cyanobacterial strains. Cyanopeptolin synthetase gene clusters have been described for Microcystis NIVA-CYA 172/5 (mcn; Tooming-Klunderud et al. 2007), Anabaena 90 (apd; Rouhiainen et al. 2000), and Planktothrix NIVA-CYA 116 (oci; Rounge et al. 2007), underlining the wide distribution of this type of nonribosomal peptides among cyanobacteria. The gene clus-ter consists of 3 (4 in Microcystis) genes coding for NRPS and, in Planktothrix and Anabaena, for a putative glyceric acid transferase domain and a putative formyl transferase domain (Rounge et al. 2007). Further, the gene clusters of Anabaena 90 and Microcystis NIVA-CYA 172/5 contain a gene for a halogenase (apdC and mcnD, respectively) that is absent in Planktothrix NIVA-CYA 116. Aeruginosin (aeruginoside) synthetase gene clusters have been sequenced from Planktothrix NIVA-CYA 126-8 (aer; Ishida et al. 2007) and for 3 Microcystis strains, PCC 7806 (Frangeul et al. 2008), NIES-843 (Kaneko et al. 2007), and NIES-98 (Ishida K, Welker M, unpublished data). All known aer gene clusters possess 3 genes each cod-ing for a complete NRPS module consisting of condensation, adenylation, and thiolation domains. In the second module, invariably an epimerization domain is found, consistent with the D-configuration of the second amino acid in most aeru-ginosins. In addition to the NRPS genes, particular gene clus-ters harbor genes for halogenases, glycosyltransferases, and sulfotransferases. Comparison of homologous gene clusters from these Microcystis strains revealed the genetic basis for the structural diversity of the final peptide products, with the presence or absence of halogenase genes being one of the most evident differences. The present study reports the aeruginosin-and cyano-peptolin-type peptide production by 28 axenic Microcystis strains and describes the molecular organization of the cor-responding NRPS gene clusters in the region where halogen-ase genes have been located. The phylogenetic history of the halogenase genes was reconstructed, as well as that of the individual strains, in order to explain the disparate distribu-tion of halogenated peptides among strains of Microcystis. Materials and Methods Cyanobacterial Strains Axenic strains of Microcystis aeruginosa (for details, see supplementary table 1, Supplementary Material online) were grown at 25 NoneC in 50 ml of BG110 supplemented with 2 mM NaNO3 and 10 mM NaHCO3 (Rippka and Herdman 1992). Continuous light was provided by Osram Universal White fluorescent tubes (30 lE mNone2 sNone1). Cells in exponen-tial growth phase (OD750 5 0.5) were harvested by centri-fugation (10,000 None g, 10 min, 25 NoneC) and lyophilized. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Analyses Microcystis strains were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry directly from intact cells (Welker et al. 2004). Chlorinated peptides were evidenced by the intensity distribution of FIG. 1.\u2014Flat structures of aeruginosin 101 (A; Ishida et al. 1999) and cyanopeptolin 954 (B; von Elert et al. 2005). Conserved parts of the structures of aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins, respectively, are indicated by bold lines. In other congeners, the chlorine atoms can be replaced by hydrogen atoms as it is the case for the sulfate group at Choi. Hpla: 4-hydroxyphenyl lactic acid; Choi: 2-carboxy-6-hydroxyoctahydroindole; Arg-derivative: agmatine (as shown), argininal, or argininol; Ahp: 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone; and side chain: very variable consisting of amino acids, fatty acids, or (sulfated) glyceric acid (Welker and von Do\u0308hren 2006). 2032 Cadel-Six et al.

Peaks with sufficient signal intensities (.104 counts) were further analyzed by postsource decay (PSD) fragmentation supported by collision-induced dissociation (Welker et al. 2006). Selected strains\u2014generally those for which analysis of crude extracts did not yield unambiguous results\u2014were further analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatogra-phy (HPLC) fractionation of lyophilized cells followed by off-line MS as described (Czarnecki et al. 2006). Polymerase Chain Reaction Assays DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France) with the following mod-ifications: 5 mg of lyophilized cells were added to 450 ll of 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 5 8), 10 mM ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, and 4 ll of RNase (100 mg mlNone1). The suspen-sion was treated in Lysing Matrix A tubes (Q-BIOgene, Illkirch, France) for two 30 s runs at a speed setting of 4.0 in the FastPrep Instrument to disrupt the cells. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65 NoneC and processed further as described by the manufacturer. Two pairs of primers were de-signed based on the nucleotide sequence of the aeruginosin and cyanopeptolin synthetase gene clusters of strain PCC 7806, respectively. For the aeruginosin synthetase gene clus-ter, the forward primer aerA_F 5#-GAT AGC ACC CAG AAC GGA AGC-3# is complementary to the 3# end of aerA, and the reverse primer aerB_R 5#-CGT TAA ACG GAT GGT TAG AGC-3# targets the 5# end of aerB. For the cya-nopeptolin synthetasecluster, the forward primer mcnC_F 5#-TAA GGA TAA TTT CTT TGA ATT GGG AG-3# targets the 3# end of mcnC, and the reverse primer mcnE_R 5#-GGG AAT AAT CTC TAA ATC AAC AGC-3# targets the 5# end of mcnE. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) for amplifications of the aerA\u2013aerB and mcnC\u2013mcnE gene regions (100 ll) contained 10ll Taq commercial buffer (10None), 2 mM MgCl2, 50\u2013100 ng of genomic DNA, 200 lM of each deoxynucleo-side triphosphate, 1 lM of each primer, and 1U Taq poly-merase (Promega Corporation, Charbonnie\u0300res, France). Amplifications were performed with an initial denaturing step of 95 NoneC for 2 min followed by 40 amplification cycles (95 NoneC for 45 s, 50 NoneC for 45 s, and 72 NoneC for 1 min) and a final elongation step of 72 NoneC for 7 min in a Robocycler 40 Gra-dient temperature Cycler (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Five microliters of each sample were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gels. Amplicons of the aeruginosin and cyanopeptolin synthe-tasegeneclusterswerecloned into the pGEM-Tvector (Prom-ega Corporation) and the ligation mixture electroporated into JM 109 cells. Recombinants were selected on Luria Broth (LB) agar plates containing ampicillin (100lg mlNone1) and iso-propyl-beta-thio-galactoside (200lmol). White colonies were picked and grown in LB-ampicillin (100lg mlNone1) liquid me-dium overnight at 37 NoneC. Plasmid DNA was purified with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN). Purified plasmids were checked for the correct size of the inserts after EcoRI digestion followed by electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) agarose gels. The plasmid inserts were sequenced (Genome Express, Meylan, France), and potential coding sequences were trans-lated and amino acid sequences compared with protein se-quence databases by Blast search. For PCR amplifications of the 16S\u201323S rDNA inter-genic transcribed spacers (ITS), the forward primer 322 5#-TGT ACA CAC CGC CCG TC-3#, complementary to the 3# end of the 16S rRNA gene, and the reverse primer 340 5#-CTC TGT GTG CCT AGG TAT CC-3#, comple-mentary to the 5# end of the 23S rRNA gene, were used (Iteman et al. 2000). PCRs (50 ll) were performed as de-scribed above. Amplification was performed as described (Iteman et al. 2000) or using the following procedure with an initial denaturing step of 95 NoneC for 2 min followed by 30 amplification cycles (95 NoneC for 30 s, 60 NoneC for 30 s, and 72 NoneC for 1 min) and a final elongation step of 7 min at 72 NoneC in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystem, Paris, France). Five microliters of reaction were analyzed by elec-trophoresis on 0.6% (w/v) agarose gel. The ITS PCR products obtained were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced directly (Genome Express). All nucleotide sequences obtained in this study are avail-able in the GenBank\u2013EMBL\u2013DDBJ database under the fol-lowing accession numbers: ITS (AM773517\u2013AM773544), aerA\u2013aerB region (AM773654\u2013AM773664), and mcnC\u2013 mcnE region (AM773665\u2013AM773679). Phylogenetic Analyses ITS sequences were aligned and analyzed as described (Garrigues et al. 2005). The phylogenetic reconstructions based on maximum likelihood (ML) analysis were per-formed with the HKY85 model. Distance analysis was car-ried out with the same evolutionary model and BIONJ algorithm (Gascuel 1997). For maximum parsimony anal-ysis, the Tree Bisection-Reconnection heuristic algorithm was used for searching through tree space. Halogenase amino acid sequences collected from data-bases (supplementary table 2, Supplementary Material on-line) were aligned with ClustalX, and the alignment was manually refined by repositioning highly conserved resi-dues in the halogenase superfamily (Dong et al. 2005) using GeneDoc version 2.6.002 (Nicholas KB and Nicholas HBJ 1997). Trees were computed using PhyML with different sub-stitution models: Dayhoff (Dayhoff et al. 1978), JTT (Jones et al. 1992), WAG (Whelan and Goldman 2001), and DCMut (Guindon and Gascuel 2003; Kosiol and Goldman 2005). For the amino acid sequence analysis, the best phylogenetic tree was obtained with the WAG substitution model (WAG model: log-likelihood value of None36273.005548). Based on the amino acid sequence alignment, a nucle-otide alignment of the halogenase genes of Microcystis, Anabaena, and 2 Xanthomonas strains was obtained using Tranalign, a reimplementation in EMBOSS of the program mrtrans. Trees were built with the PAUP software applying the general time reversible model to ML and BIONJ analyses. Statistical confidence levels for all topologies were eval-uated by the nonparametric bootstrap method (100 replicates). GC contents were calculated with the program RE-VSEQ (EMBOSS), and analysis of synonymous or Halogenase Genes in Microcystis NRPS Clusters 2033 D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /m be/article/25/9/2031/1303587 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June nonsynonymous substitution rates was performed with SWAAP 1.0.1 (Pride 2004). Results Detection of Peptides and PCR Results Mass spectral analysis of whole cells or HPLC frac-tions revealed the presence of various oligopeptides in all Microcystis strains. Aeruginosin-or cyanopeptolin-type peptides could be identified in 22 and 18 strains, respec-tively, whereas both peptide types were detected in 12 strains (table 1). Most congeners have been described pre-viously or were very similar to previously described ones, for example, by addition of a sulfate group. In PCC 7005 and 9905, for example, a peptide (aeruginosin 688) was de-tected with a molecular mass and fragmentation pattern cor-responding to microcin SF608 (Hpla-Phe-Choi-Agmatine; Banker and Carmeli 1999) that was, however, found to be sulfated, as evidenced by a mass difference of 80 Da when the samples were analyzed in negative ion extraction mode. Another aeruginosin, aeruginosin 686 (ClHpla-Tyr-Choi-Argininal) in PCC 7806, corresponds to a chlorinated aer-uginosin 102 (SuHpla-Tyr-Choi-Argininal) lacking a sulfate group. A corresponding nonchlorinated variant is aerugino-sin 652 (Hpla-Tyr-Choi-Argininal), produced by 3 of the analyzed strains. Among cyanopeptolin-type peptides, 2 chlorinated congeners were identified with nearly identical mass but with different amino acid sequences, cyano-peptolins 1040A ([Arg-Ahp-Phe-Cl,MTyr-Val-O-Thr]-Asp-hexanoic acid; M \u00fe H\u00fe 5 1041.48 Da) and 1040C ([Hty-Ahp-Leu-Cl,MTyr-Val-O-Thr]-Gln-hexanoic acid; M \u00fe H\u00fe 5 1041.51 Da). The latter was identified in strain PCC 9808 together with a nonchlorinated congener (cyano-peptolin 1040B [Hty-Ahp-Phe-MTyr-Val-O-Thr]-Gln-hexanoic acid) with M \u00fe H\u00fe 5 1041.53 Da in which a leucine is replaced by a phenylalanine, compensating the mass difference attributed to the lack of a chlorine atom (Dm 5 34 Da). In cyanopeptolins, chlorination was found only in congeners with a tyrosine in position 5 of the ring (fig. 1B) and never when this position was occupied by a phenylalanine. For a number of strains, the aeruginosin-or cyanopeptolin-type peptides could not be fully character-ized and only a classification could be achieved. For aeruginosins, a typical fragment in PSD spectra is the Choi-immonium ion (m/z 140), whereas for cyanopeptolins, no singular characteristic fragment can be identified but series Table 1 Presence and Lengths (base pair) of the aerA\u2013aerB and mcnC\u2013mcnE-Amplicons in Comparison to the Corresponding Oligopeptides Identified in Microcystis Strains Strain PCR, Base Pair Peptide PCR, Base Pair Peptide aerA\u2013aerB Aeruginosins mcnC\u2013mcnE Cyanopeptolins PCC 7005 991a Aeruginosin 688b 2,298a Cyanopeptolin 954 PCC 7806 2,855a Aeruginosin 686 585a Cyanopeptolin A PCC 7813 2,855a Aeruginosin 636c 585a Aeruginopeptin 228 PCC 7820 2,855 Aeruginosin 636c 585 Aeruginopeptin 228 PCC 7941 991 n.d. 2,298a Cyanopeptolin 1040A PCC 9354 991 Aeruginosind 2,298 Cyanopeptolin 1040A PCC 9355 991 n.d. 2,298 Cyanopeptolin 1040A PCC 9432 991 Aeruginosin 574 585 Cyanopeptolind PCC 9443 991 Aeruginosin 652 n.p. n.d.

In agreement with previous findings (Czarnecki et al. 2006; Welker et al. 2006), several congeners of a particular peptide type could be identified in most strains, and only the most abundant ones, as assumed from peak height in mass spectra, are given in table 1 (with few exceptions as indi-cated). In the case of aeruginosins, congeners with a varying degree of chlorination have been detected in individual strains, for example, aeruginosins 98-B (Hpla-Ile-SuChoi-Agmatine), 98-A, and 101 in Microcystis NIES-98, which are non-, mono-, and dichlorinated at the Hpla moiety, re-spectively. Chlorination was never observed for both peptide types when these were coproduced by an individual strain. PCR assays with primers specific for the aerA\u2013aerB re-gion gave positive results for all strains, except for strains PCC 9603 and PCC 9622, and single amplicons of either 2,855 or 991 bp were obtained (table 1). Sequences were not obtained for all amplicons, and hence, the length of non-sequenced amplicons could only be estimated. However, the high conservation of both sequence types, long and short am-plicons, respectively (fig. 2), suggests that the length of non-sequenced amplicons is very close if not identical to sequenced ones. This also applies to the mcn-amplicons. PCR assays with primers specific for the mcnC\u2013mcnE region gave positive results for 20 strains. When positive, single amplicons of either 2,298 or 585 bp were obtained, except for strains PCC 9603 (2,829 bp) and PCC 9807 (681 bp) (table 1). Positive PCR results were in agreement with the de-tection of corresponding aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins in most strains. However, no cyanopeptolins were detected in 2 strains for which the presence of a PCR amplicon in-dicates the existence of an mcn gene cluster (NIES-89 and NIES-298). Similarly, in 4 other strains (PCC 7941, PCC 9355, PCC 9808, and PCC 10025), aer-amplicons were de-tected but no corresponding aeruginosin-type peptides. The production of chlorinated congeners was clearly related to long amplicons for both peptide types with few exceptions, for example, in strain NIES-298 that produces only the non-chlorinated aeruginosins 298 A and B in detectable amounts (table 1). Arrangement of Halogenase Genes in the aer and mcn Synthetase Gene Clusters Nucleotide sequence analyses of the large amplicons (aerA\u2013aerB: 2,855 bp; mcnC\u2013mcnE: 2,298 bp) by Blast re-vealed in both cases an open reading frame (ORF) of 1878 bp (except for strain PCC 9812 whose aerA\u2013B amplicon contains an ORF of 1,881 bp) named aerJ and mcnD (fig. 2A). The corresponding putative proteins (AerJ and McnD) did not show similarity to peptide synthetases by Blast but to various prokaryotic halogenases, including ApdC and McnD of Anabaena 90 and Microcystis NI-VA-CYA 172/5, respectively. Detailed analysis of their de-duced amino acid sequences showed the presence of motifs GxGxxG and WxWxIP, 2 highly conserved motifs in FADH2-dependent halogenases (van Pe\u0301e and Zehner 2003) (supplementary figure, Supplementary Material online). In both halogenase gene regions, direct repeats (DRs) were identified. In the long aerA\u2013B sequences (2,855 bp), 2 short DRs (GTTGA; GTTGA/C in strain PCC 9812) were located 6 bp downstream of the putative start codon and 15 bp (9 bp in strain PCC 9812) downstream of the stop codon of aerJ. An identical deletion of 1,884 bp encompass-ing the totality of aerJ and leaving only one copy of the DR was observed in the corresponding sequences of strains that yielded short amplicons (991 bp) (fig. 2A). Intergenic regions upstream and downstream of aerJ shared by strains with and without aerJ showed more than 90% sequence identities.

Halogenase Genes in Microcystis NRPS Clusters 2035 D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /m be/article/25/9/2031/1303587 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June Two long imperfect DRs (107 bp) were identified in the 2,298 bp mcnC\u2013mcnE-sequences (fig. 2B). These in-clude the last 2 nt of the putative start codon and the stop codon of mcnD. In strains that yielded short mcnC\u2013mcnE-amplicons (585 bp), 2 deletions (198 and 1,506 bp) with exactly the same break points were identified, leaving frag-ments of mcnD with one truncated and one complete DR sequence (fig. 2B). These truncated mcnD sequences share more than 84% sequence identities with the corresponding segments in strains carrying a complete mcnD (mcnD\u00fe). The 2,829 bp mcnC\u2013mcnE-sequence in strain PCC 9603 has the same imperfect DRs and a complete mcnD of 1,878 bp but carries 2 insertions, 1 of 54 bp and 1 of 477 bp upstream and downstream of mcnD, respectively (fig. 2B). In strain PCC 9807, the mcnC\u2013mcnE-sequence (without a complete mcnD) had a size of 681 bp (compared with 585 bp in other strains) due to an insertion of 96 bp located 10 bp downstream of the mcnC stop codon. This insertion showed 96% sequence identities with the mcyE\u2013mcyG intergenic region of the microcystin synthe-tase operon of Planktothrix rubescens (strain WAHN) (Mbedi et al. 2005). Only in strain PCC 9812, the halogenase genes are present in both the aer and mcn NRPS gene clusters. Distribution of the aerJ \u00fe/None and mcnD \u00fe/None Synthetase Gene Clusters and ITS Phylogeny In phylogenetic trees based on full-length ITS sequen-ces, the 28 Microcystis strains formed 6 distinct monophy-letic groups (I\u2013VI) that were supported by bootstrap values above 50%, irrespective of the 3 different methods em-ployed for the analyses (fig. 3). These ITS groups did not reflect the geographic origin of strains, except ITS group I that includes 5 strains isolated in North America. In addition, 6 of the Microcystis strains (PCC 7806, PCC 9624, PCC 9443, PCC 9810, PCC 9808, and PCC 10025) seem to represent polyphyletic lineages, distinct from one another and more or less distant to the monophy-letic ITS groups I\u2013VI identified here. Based on PCR results (table 1), the presence of both, the aer and mcn NRPS gene clusters, was frequently ob-served in individual strains (in 18 of the 28 strains) and con-sistently in all strains of ITS groups I, II, and IV. Strains PCC 9354 and PCC 7820 are, respectively, duplicates of strains PCC 7941 (ITS group I) and PCC 7813 (ITS group II) and thus are not included in figure 3 (see supplementary table 1, Supplementary Material online). Co-occurrence of presence of aerJ was observed only for the strains of ITS group III. A complete mcnD is also observed in all strains of ITS group I, whereas aerJ is only present in strain PCC 9812 within this group. In ITS groups II and IV, aerJ is present in some of the strains, none of which has a complete mcnD. In the remaining strains, including ITS groups V and VI, aerJ and mcnD are absent in all strains with the excep-tion of strain PCC 9603 (ITS group VI). The presence of at least one complete halogenase gene is more frequently ob-served in strains of ITS groups I, II, and III than among all other strains. Phylogenetic Relationships of Halogenases For a broader view on the distribution of halogenases among bacteria, we collected sequences from accessible da-tabases based on a Blast search or on the literature. This revealed a number of homologues of the Microcystis hal-ogenases in unrelated prokaryotic taxa (see supplementary table 2, Supplementary Material online), also including a se-transfer (HGT) may be involved in their present taxonomic distribution. Furthermore, the average genomic GC content of Microcystis is 41.9 \u00b1 0.4% (n 5 9 strains; Rippka and Herdman 1992), whereas that of aerJ and mcnD halogenase genes is slightly lower (37.7 \u00b1 0.5%) and displays higher GC deviations in the third position of codons (GC3: 26.8 \u00b1 0.04%). The NRPS-related halogenases of the Microcystis strains are separated into 2 well-defined subgroups, one in-cluding McnD/ApdC sequences and the other AerJ sequen-ces. This subdivision may result of a convergent evolution due to the functional specialization of each gene to puta-tively chlorinate similar substrates or reflect the presence of ancient paralogues that, in the course of evolution, di-verged in the respective NRPS clusters. Pairwise compar-ison of the synonymous (KS) and nonsynonymous (KA) nucleotide substitutions between the aerJ and mcnD (apdC) data sets showed different rates of mutations for each sub-group, with a higher degree of divergence in the mcnD sub-group (data not shown). However, no evidence of accelerated evolution (positive selection pressure) promot-ing amino acid divergence was found along the gene. The KA/KS ratios below 1 obtained for both subgroups indicate that the genes were subject to purifying selection. These results support an ancient origin of the halogenase genes, followed by their progressive divergence in the aer and mcn NRPS gene clusters. Discussion For most of the Microcystis strains examined, the de-tection of the NRPS gene clusters and halogenase genes by PCR assays is consistent with the detection of correspond-ing peptides by chemical analyses, as well as with the chlo-rination of particular congeners. The apparent lack of \u2018\u2018expected\u2019\u2019 peptides in some of the strains may be the result of cellular concentration levels below the limit of detection, dysfunctional halogenase genes, or impairment of other re-gions of the NRPS clusters such as that reported for the micro-cystin synthetase gene cluster in P. rubescens (Christiansen et al. 2006). In the present study, as well as in more than 1,000 sin-gle colonies and isolate samples of Microcystis, no chlori-nated congeners of both, aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins, could be detected (Welker et al. 2004, 2006). In agreement, a chlorinated aeruginosin, but no chlorinated cyanopepto-lin, was detected in strain PCC 9812, in spite of the fact that a halogenase gene is present in both of the 2 corresponding NRPS gene clusters. A reason for the apparent mutual ex-clusion of chlorinating enzymes or chlorinating activity, re-spectively, associated with the 2 peptide synthetases remains, however, to be elucidated. The chlorinating activity of AerJ and McnD appar-ently can result in the production of congeners with varying degrees of chlorination, both in axenic strains (see above) and in field samples (Welker et al. 2006). In Microcystis NIES-98, for example, non-, mono-, and dichlorinated aer-uginosins are detectable as it is correspondingly the case with cyanopeptolins in PCC 9808. Both the aeruginosin and cyanopeptolin halogenases evidently are functional in general in individual strains although apparently not ab-solutely necessary for the peptides\u2019 biosynthesis in the NRPS assembly line, that is, a lacking chlorination does not interrupt the further biosynthetical steps. This was also found for the clorobiocin synthesis in Streptomyces, for example, where the disruption of the halogenase gene (clo-hal) resulted in the production of a nonhalogenated congener at higher cellu-lar concentrations than compared with clorobiocin in the wild type (Eusta\u0301quio et al. 2003). Chlorination of a small peptide has been shown to modify the properties of the molecule, that is, by electronic and steric effects, with consequences on its biological ac-tivity (Harris et al. 1985; Eusta\u0301quio et al. 2003). In cyano-bacteria, the function of chlorinated or nonchlorinated oligopeptides remains, however, to be elucidated. The strong potential of cyanopeptolins, for example, to inhibit serine proteases is not influenced by chlorination per se as evidenced by X-ray studies of a nonchlorinated and a chlo-rinated congener cocrystallized with proteases (Lee et al. 1994; Matern et al. 2003). Individual congeners, on the other hand, have been shown to differently inhibit protease activity of a potential grazer, the common freshwater her-bivore Daphnia (von Elert et al. 2005; Czarnecki et al. 2006). The multitude of bioactive peptides in a population could increase the efficiency as grazing protection com-pared with a few peptides by hampering the physiological adaption of a grazer to \u2018\u2018inhibitory\u2019\u2019 diet through the expres-sion of specific proteolytic enzymes. However, the high structural diversity provides evi-dence that corresponding NRPS gene clusters have an in-trinsic plasticity leading to the production of various analogous peptide structures in natural mixtures of clones or chemotypes. Structural diversity of natural products syn-thesized by modular enzyme complexes is largely based on recombination of nucleotide sequences coding for individ-ual domains, like in fungal polyketide synthase systems (Jenke-Kodama et al. 2005). Accordingly, recombination between cyanobacterial NRPS gene modules, involving ex-changes of substrate-specific domains, has been shown for the microcystin synthetase genes (Mikalsen et al. 2003; Tanabe et al. 2004). In the phylogenetic tree inferred from halogenase amino acid sequences, some unexpected groupings were found, encompassing \u2018\u2018alien sequences\u2019\u2019 as judged by the phylogeny of the respective organisms from which the se-quences were obtained. This is clearly the case for the hal-ogenase of the protist D. discoideum, which groups with 3 cyanobacterial halogenases, and thus, the corresponding genes may have been acquired by HGT from a cyanobacte-rium. A similar conclusion was made by phylogenomic anal-ysis of protistan polyketide synthases (John et al. 2008). Similarly to the halogenase of M. smegmatis, the Microcystis halogenases could have been acquired from an ancestor of Proteobacteria. Sequences acquired through HGT generally tend to accumulate mutations that progres-sively lead to the acquisition of sequence characteristics corresponding to their new genetic environment. The Microcystis aerJ and mcnD halogenase genes display GC contents only slightly lower than that of total genomic DNAs. Therefore, it seems likely that their presence in modern Microcystis strains is the result of an ancient HGT. 2038 Cadel-Six et al. D ow nloaded from https://academic.oup.com /m be/article/25/9/2031/1303587 by University of Illinois at Urbana-C ham paign user on 01 June Halogenase genes in the mcn and apd clusters in Mi-crocystis (Chroococcales) and Anabaena (Nostocales), and chlorinated cyanopeptolins in other phylogenetically dis-tant cyanobacterial taxa, support the view that mcn/apd NRPS gene clusters containing a halogenase gene occurred early in the cyanobacterial lineage. Chlorinated aerugino-sins, on the other hand, have been reported for Planktothrix strains, but the chlorination occurs on another residue than in Microcystis (at the Choi moiety; Shin et al. 1997), and the aer gene cluster of Planktothrix NIVA-CYA 126-8 does not contain aerJ (Ishida et al. 2007). As long as no further data are available, it can be assumed that the possession of aerJ is a characteristic of Microcystis strains. Considering the topology of the halogenase phyloge-netic trees and the relatively high sequence identity be-tween aerJ and mcnD, an ancient gene duplication of mcnD and its integration into the aer cluster before their diversification may have occurred in an ancestor leading to modern Microcystis. An independent acquisition of halo-genase genes by HGT cannot be excluded but seems less likely because aerJ and mcnD are rarely present together in an individual strain. For the evolutionary scenario, we hence propose that an ancestral Microcystis had both, the aer and mcn gene clusters, each containing a halogenase gene that was sub-sequently lost in some of the phylogenetic lineages. The presence of mcnD fragments between mcnC and mcnE in strains lacking a complete mcnD gene clearly indicates that the presence of a halogenase gene in the mcn gene clus-ter represents the ancestral state. The loss of mcnD might then have occurred either repeatedly with identical break points in a number of strains or as a singular loss event in-herited to Microcystis lineages. Because the distribution of mcnD in the mcn cluster is consistent for all the monophy-letic ITS groups (except ITS group VI), a singular loss event appears to be more likely. On the other hand, the genomic region around mcnD is bordered by long imperfect DRs that possibly present a re-gion of high susceptibility to specific DNA rearrangements. This might be the reason for the peculiar sequences in both strains of ITS group VI (PCC 9603 and PCC 9807) that respectively contain unique types of insertions in the mcnC\u2013mcnE region, suggesting that in these strains partic-ular mechanisms modified the gene arrangement possibly more recently than in other lineages (figs. 2 and 3). In the aer gene clusters, no representatives carrying fragments of halogenase genes were found, but the strictly identical deletions observed and the DRs presumably repre-senting break points suggest that this lack may also be due to gene loss. If so, the lack of aerJ in Microcystis strains could be the result of repeated losses as suggested by the inconsis-tent distribution of aerJ among strains of the ITS groups I, II, and IV. Indeed, the involvement of short DRs, of which only one is left in aerJNone strains (fig. 2A), has frequently been ob-served in gene deletions and is explained by a slipped-strand mispairing mechanism (Levinson and Gutman 1987). The mechanism leading to the loss of one or the other complete NRPS gene clusters (aer or mcn) in some Microcystis lineages (fig. 3) remains to be explored. A similar sporadic distribution of the microcystin synthetase gene cluster, not concordant with phylogenies based on housekeeping genes, was proposed to be the result of re-peated gene losses by a yet unknown mechanism, whereas horizontal transfer of entire gene clusters was considered unlikely (Rantala et al. 2004). The present study highlights the genetic basis for nat-ural product structural diversity exemplarily for NRPS-associated halogenase genes and chlorination of peptide products. Mechanisms such as HGT, recombination, and gene losses apparently result in a high plasticity of the ar-chitecture and functionality of strain-specific NRPS gene clusters, leading to a vast structural diversity of correspond-ing peptide products in closely related cyanobacteria. How the evolution of and rearrangements in cyanobacterial NRPS gene clusters actually come to pass is poorly under-stood yet, especially with regard to the lack of evidence for HGT in the genus Microcystis. An improved understanding of cyanobacterial combinatorial biosynthesis in vivo could be the base for the design and production of new pharma-ceuticals in the future.

        "Cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis are known to produce secondary metabolites of large structural diversity by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways. For a number of such compounds, halogenated congeners have been reported along with nonhalogenated ones. In the present study, chlorinated cyanopeptolin-and/or aeruginosin-type peptides were detected by mass spectrometry in 17 out of 28 axenic strains of Microcystis. In these strains, a halogenase gene was identified between 2 genes coding for NRPS modules in respective gene clusters, whereas it was consistently absent when the strains produced only nonchlorinated corresponding congeners. Nucleotide sequences were obtained for 12 complete halogenase genes and 14 intermodule regions of gene clusters lacking a halogenase gene or containing only fragments of it. When a halogenase gene was found absent, a specific, identical excision pattern was observed for both synthetase gene clusters in most strains. A phylogenetic analysis including other bacterial halogenases showed that the NRPS-related halogenases of Microcystis form a monophyletic group divided into 2 subgroups, corresponding to either the cyanopeptolin or the aeruginosin peptide synthetases. The distribution of these peptide synthetase gene clusters, among the tested Microcystis strains, was found in relative agreement with their phylogeny reconstructed from 16S\u201323S rDNA intergenic spacer sequences, whereas the distribution of the associated halogenase genes appears to be sporadic. The presented data suggest that in cyanobacteria these prevalent halogenase genes originated from an ancient horizontal gene transfer followed by duplication in the cyanobacterial lineage. We propose an evolutionary scenario implying repeated gene losses to explain the distribution of halogenase genes in 2 NRPS gene clusters that subsequently defines the seemingly erratic production of halogenated and nonhalogenated aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins among Microcystis strains.",
        "Introduction Cyanobacteria are a rich source of structurally diverse",
        "oligopeptides that are predominantly synthesized by nonri-bosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). In Microcystis, a common genus in eutrophic freshwaters, numerous bio-active peptides have been identified that can be mostly classified as aeruginosins, microginins, microcystins, cya-nopeptolins, and anabaenopeptins (Welker and von Do\u0308hren 2006). One intriguing property of these peptides is their structural diversity, achieved either by variability of amino acid moieties in particular positions or by modifications like glycosylation, sulfatation, methylation, or halogenation (Ishida et al. 1999, 2007; Rouhiainen et al. 2000; von Elert et al. 2005) giving rise to virtually hundreds of congeners in each peptide class. The potential of Microcystis to produce a multitude of",
        "chlorinated peptides has been recognized in chemotyping studies of natural populations (Welker et al. 2006). Halogenated congeners have mainly been found among aeruginosin-, cyanopeptolin-(fig. 1), and microginin-type peptides, so far. It has to be noted that the names \u2018\u2018aerugino-sin\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018cyanopeptolin\u2019\u2019 refer to peptide types with unique features (see fig. 1) regardless whether individual peptide structures have been named differently. Cyanopeptolin-type peptides, for example, have been named cyanopeptolins,",
        "anabaenopeptilides, microcystilide, aeruginopeptins, or os-cillapeptins in the original publications (for a review, see Welker and von Do\u0308hren 2006). Cyanopeptolin-type pepti-des have been reported from distant cyanobacterial taxa be-longing to the Orders Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales (Welker and von Do\u0308hren 2006). Most structural variants inhibit serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase) by preventing the hydrolytic attack on substrates by covering the active center with the rigid ring structure (Matern et al. 2003). Many structural variants of aerugino-sins have been reported from Microcystis (Chroococcales) and Planktothrix (Oscillatoriales). Aeruginosins have also been shown to inhibit serine proteases, especially thrombin (Ishida et al. 1999). Despite the ubiquitous presence of these peptides (and others) in natural cyanobacterial consortia, a consistent hypothesis explaining their function in produc-ing cells has not yet been proposed. In microginins, linear tetra-or pentapeptides, chlorina-tion occurs at an N-terminal aliphatic moiety (a modified decanoic acid) (Ishida et al. 1998), whereas in aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins, chlorination occurs at aromatic moie-ties. Expectedly, halogenating enzymes differ for these 2 types of chlorination. Aliphatic halogenation has been re-ported for the barbamide biosynthesis pathway of Lyngbya majuscula (Sitachitta et al. 2000), where a chlorine is transferred to a native leucine during biosynthesis by a nonheme FeII halogenase (Galonic et al. 2006). A sim-ilar enzyme has been reported for the syringomycin bio-synthesis in Pseudomonas syringae (Vaillancourt et al. 2005). Halogenation on aromatic moieties is thought to be catalyzed primarily by FADH2-dependent halogenases (Vaillancourt et al. 2006; van Pe\u0301e and Patallo 2006). In Microcystis, mono-or dichlorination of aeruginosins",

Monochlorination in cyanopeptolins is reported for an N-methylated tyrosine or homotyrosine, respectively (Rouhiainen et al. 2000; von Elert et al. 2005).",
        "A number of studies reported the presence and func-tion of enzymes responsible for the halogenation of second-ary metabolites of pharmaceutical interest, such as pentachloropseudilin (Wynands and van Pe\u0301e 2004), cloro-biocin (Eusta\u0301quio et al. 2003), pyrrolnitrin (Keller et al. 2000), or pyoluteorin (Dorrestein et al. 2005). Mechanistic studies indicated that chlorination is regioselective either on free substrates, like during pyrrolnitrin or rebeccamycin synthesis (Dong et al. 2005; Yeh et al. 2005), or while in-termediates are tethered to NRPS enzymes like during clor-obiocin or pyoluteorin synthesis (Eusta\u0301quio et al. 2003; Dorrestein et al. 2005). These studies suggest that specific halogenase genes are closely associated to particular NRPS gene clusters and that halogenase genes may be absent or dysfunctional in strains producing nonchlorinated peptide congeners that are very similar to chlorinated ones.",
        "An initial mass spectrometrical screening of axenic Microcystis strains revealed the presence of aeruginosins and/or cyanopeptolins, both chlorinated and nonchlori-nated. This raised the question whether the distribution of chlorinated congeners correlates with the presence of",
        "halogenase genes in corresponding NRPS operons that have been characterized for several cyanobacterial strains. Cyanopeptolin synthetase gene clusters have been described for Microcystis NIVA-CYA 172/5 (mcn; Tooming-Klunderud et al. 2007), Anabaena 90 (apd; Rouhiainen et al. 2000), and Planktothrix NIVA-CYA 116 (oci; Rounge et al. 2007), underlining the wide distribution of this type of nonribosomal peptides among cyanobacteria. The gene clus-ter consists of 3 (4 in Microcystis) genes coding for NRPS and, in Planktothrix and Anabaena, for a putative glyceric acid transferase domain and a putative formyl transferase domain (Rounge et al. 2007). Further, the gene clusters of Anabaena 90 and Microcystis NIVA-CYA 172/5 contain a gene for a halogenase (apdC and mcnD, respectively) that is absent in Planktothrix NIVA-CYA 116. Aeruginosin (aeruginoside) synthetase gene clusters have been sequenced from Planktothrix NIVA-CYA 126-8 (aer; Ishida et al. 2007) and for 3 Microcystis strains, PCC 7806 (Frangeul et al. 2008), NIES-843 (Kaneko et al. 2007), and NIES-98 (Ishida K, Welker M, unpublished data). All known aer gene clusters possess 3 genes each cod-ing for a complete NRPS module consisting of condensation, adenylation, and thiolation domains. In the second module, invariably an epimerization domain is found, consistent with the D-configuration of the second amino acid in most aeru-ginosins. In addition to the NRPS genes, particular gene clus-ters harbor genes for halogenases, glycosyltransferases, and sulfotransferases. Comparison of homologous gene clusters from these Microcystis strains revealed the genetic basis for the structural diversity of the final peptide products, with the presence or absence of halogenase genes being one of the most evident differences. The present study reports the aeruginosin-and cyano-peptolin-type peptide production by 28 axenic Microcystis strains and describes the molecular organization of the cor-responding NRPS gene clusters in the region where halogen-ase genes have been located. The phylogenetic history of the halogenase genes was reconstructed, as well as that of the individual strains, in order to explain the disparate distribu-tion of halogenated peptides among strains of Microcystis.",

For maximum parsimony anal-ysis, the Tree Bisection-Reconnection heuristic algorithm was used for searching through tree space. Halogenase amino acid sequences collected from data-bases (supplementary table 2, Supplementary Material on-line) were aligned with ClustalX, and the alignment was manually refined by repositioning highly conserved resi-dues in the halogenase superfamily (Dong et al. 2005) using GeneDoc version 2.6.002 (Nicholas KB and Nicholas HBJ 1997). Trees were computed using PhyML with different sub-stitution models: Dayhoff (Dayhoff et al. 1978), JTT (Jones et al. 1992), WAG (Whelan and Goldman 2001), and DCMut (Guindon and Gascuel 2003; Kosiol and Goldman 2005). For the amino acid sequence analysis, the best phylogenetic tree was obtained with the WAG substitution model (WAG model: log-likelihood value of None36273.005548).

Aeruginosin-or cyanopeptolin-type peptides could be identified in 22 and 18 strains, respec-tively, whereas both peptide types were detected in 12 strains (table 1). Most congeners have been described pre-viously or were very similar to previously described ones, for example, by addition of a sulfate group.

These ITS groups did not reflect the geographic origin of strains, except ITS group I that includes 5 strains isolated in North America. In addition, 6 of the Microcystis strains (PCC 7806, PCC 9624, PCC 9443, PCC 9810, PCC 9808, and PCC 10025) seem to represent polyphyletic lineages, distinct from one another and more or less distant to the monophy-letic ITS groups I\u2013VI identified here.

Furthermore, the average genomic GC content of Microcystis is 41.9 \u00b1 0.4% (n 5 9 strains; Rippka and Herdman 1992), whereas that of aerJ and mcnD halogenase genes is slightly lower (37.7 \u00b1 0.5%) and displays higher GC deviations in the third position of codons (GC3: 26.8 \u00b1 0.04%).",
        "The NRPS-related halogenases of the Microcystis strains are separated into 2 well-defined subgroups, one in-cluding McnD/ApdC sequences and the other AerJ sequen-ces. This subdivision may result of a convergent evolution due to the functional specialization of each gene to puta-tively chlorinate similar substrates or reflect the presence of ancient paralogues that, in the course of evolution, di-verged in the respective NRPS clusters. Pairwise compar-ison of the synonymous (KS) and nonsynonymous (KA) nucleotide substitutions between the aerJ and mcnD (apdC) data sets showed different rates of mutations for each sub-group, with a higher degree of divergence in the mcnD sub-group (data not shown). However, no evidence of accelerated evolution (positive selection pressure) promot-ing amino acid divergence was found along the gene. The KA/KS ratios below 1 obtained for both subgroups indicate that the genes were subject to purifying selection. These results support an ancient origin of the halogenase genes, followed by their progressive divergence in the aer and mcn NRPS gene clusters. Discussion",
        "For most of the Microcystis strains examined, the de-tection of the NRPS gene clusters and halogenase genes by PCR assays is consistent with the detection of correspond-ing peptides by chemical analyses, as well as with the chlo-rination of particular congeners. The apparent lack of \u2018\u2018expected\u2019\u2019 peptides in some of the strains may be the result of cellular concentration levels below the limit of detection, dysfunctional halogenase genes, or impairment of other re-gions of the NRPS clusters such as that reported for the micro-cystin synthetase gene cluster in P. rubescens (Christiansen et al. 2006).",
        "In the present study, as well as in more than 1,000 sin-gle colonies and isolate samples of Microcystis, no chlori-nated congeners of both, aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins, could be detected (Welker et al. 2004, 2006). In agreement, a chlorinated aeruginosin, but no chlorinated cyanopepto-lin, was detected in strain PCC 9812, in spite of the fact that a halogenase gene is present in both of the 2 corresponding NRPS gene clusters. A reason for the apparent mutual ex-clusion of chlorinating enzymes or chlorinating activity, re-spectively, associated with the 2 peptide synthetases remains, however, to be elucidated.",
        "The chlorinating activity of AerJ and McnD appar-ently can result in the production of congeners with varying degrees of chlorination, both in axenic strains (see above) and in field samples (Welker et al. 2006). In Microcystis NIES-98, for example, non-, mono-, and dichlorinated aer-uginosins are detectable as it is correspondingly the case with cyanopeptolins in PCC 9808. Both the aeruginosin and cyanopeptolin halogenases evidently are functional",
        "in general in individual strains although apparently not ab-solutely necessary for the peptides\u2019 biosynthesis in the NRPS assembly line, that is, a lacking chlorination does not interrupt the further biosynthetical steps. This was also found for the clorobiocin synthesis in Streptomyces, for example, where the disruption of the halogenase gene (clo-hal) resulted in the production of a nonhalogenated congener at higher cellu-lar concentrations than compared with clorobiocin in the wild type (Eusta\u0301quio et al. 2003). Chlorination of a small peptide has been shown to modify the properties of the molecule, that is, by electronic and steric effects, with consequences on its biological ac-tivity (Harris et al. 1985; Eusta\u0301quio et al. 2003). In cyano-bacteria, the function of chlorinated or nonchlorinated oligopeptides remains, however, to be elucidated. The strong potential of cyanopeptolins, for example, to inhibit serine proteases is not influenced by chlorination per se as evidenced by X-ray studies of a nonchlorinated and a chlo-rinated congener cocrystallized with proteases (Lee et al. 1994; Matern et al. 2003). Individual congeners, on the other hand, have been shown to differently inhibit protease activity of a potential grazer, the common freshwater her-bivore Daphnia (von Elert et al. 2005; Czarnecki et al. 2006). The multitude of bioactive peptides in a population could increase the efficiency as grazing protection com-pared with a few peptides by hampering the physiological adaption of a grazer to \u2018\u2018inhibitory\u2019\u2019 diet through the expres-sion of specific proteolytic enzymes. However, the high structural diversity provides evi-dence that corresponding NRPS gene clusters have an in-trinsic plasticity leading to the production of various analogous peptide structures in natural mixtures of clones or chemotypes. Structural diversity of natural products syn-thesized by modular enzyme complexes is largely based on recombination of nucleotide sequences coding for individ-ual domains, like in fungal polyketide synthase systems (Jenke-Kodama et al. 2005). Accordingly, recombination between cyanobacterial NRPS gene modules, involving ex-changes of substrate-specific domains, has been shown for the microcystin synthetase genes (Mikalsen et al. 2003; Tanabe et al. 2004). In the phylogenetic tree inferred from halogenase amino acid sequences, some unexpected groupings were found, encompassing \u2018\u2018alien sequences\u2019\u2019 as judged by the phylogeny of the respective organisms from which the se-quences were obtained. This is clearly the case for the hal-ogenase of the protist D. discoideum, which groups with 3 cyanobacterial halogenases, and thus, the corresponding genes may have been acquired by HGT from a cyanobacte-rium. A similar conclusion was made by phylogenomic anal-ysis of protistan polyketide synthases (John et al. 2008). Similarly to the halogenase of M. smegmatis, the Microcystis halogenases could have been acquired from an ancestor of Proteobacteria. Sequences acquired through HGT generally tend to accumulate mutations that progres-sively lead to the acquisition of sequence characteristics corresponding to their new genetic environment. The Microcystis aerJ and mcnD halogenase genes display GC contents only slightly lower than that of total genomic DNAs. Therefore, it seems likely that their presence in modern Microcystis strains is the result of an ancient HGT.",

        "crocystis (Chroococcales) and Anabaena (Nostocales), and chlorinated cyanopeptolins in other phylogenetically dis-tant cyanobacterial taxa, support the view that mcn/apd NRPS gene clusters containing a halogenase gene occurred early in the cyanobacterial lineage. Chlorinated aerugino-sins, on the other hand, have been reported for Planktothrix strains, but the chlorination occurs on another residue than in Microcystis (at the Choi moiety; Shin et al. 1997), and the aer gene cluster of Planktothrix NIVA-CYA 126-8 does not contain aerJ (Ishida et al. 2007). As long as no further data are available, it can be assumed that the possession of aerJ is a characteristic of Microcystis strains. Considering the topology of the halogenase phyloge-",
        "netic trees and the relatively high sequence identity be-tween aerJ and mcnD, an ancient gene duplication of mcnD and its integration into the aer cluster before their diversification may have occurred in an ancestor leading to modern Microcystis. An independent acquisition of halo-genase genes by HGT cannot be excluded but seems less likely because aerJ and mcnD are rarely present together in an individual strain. For the evolutionary scenario, we hence propose that",
        "an ancestral Microcystis had both, the aer and mcn gene clusters, each containing a halogenase gene that was sub-sequently lost in some of the phylogenetic lineages. The presence of mcnD fragments between mcnC and mcnE in strains lacking a complete mcnD gene clearly indicates that the presence of a halogenase gene in the mcn gene clus-ter represents the ancestral state. The loss of mcnD might then have occurred either repeatedly with identical break points in a number of strains or as a singular loss event in-herited to Microcystis lineages. Because the distribution of mcnD in the mcn cluster is consistent for all the monophy-letic ITS groups (except ITS group VI), a singular loss event appears to be more likely. On the other hand, the genomic region around mcnD is",
        "bordered by long imperfect DRs that possibly present a re-gion of high susceptibility to specific DNA rearrangements. This might be the reason for the peculiar sequences in both strains of ITS group VI (PCC 9603 and PCC 9807) that respectively contain unique types of insertions in the mcnC\u2013mcnE region, suggesting that in these strains partic-ular mechanisms modified the gene arrangement possibly more recently than in other lineages (figs. 2 and 3). In the aer gene clusters, no representatives carrying",
        "fragments of halogenase genes were found, but the strictly identical deletions observed and the DRs presumably repre-senting break points suggest that this lack may also be due to gene loss. If so, the lack of aerJ in Microcystis strains could be the result of repeated losses as suggested by the inconsis-tent distribution of aerJ among strains of the ITS groups I, II, and IV. Indeed, the involvement of short DRs, of which only one is left in aerJNone strains (fig. 2A), has frequently been ob-served in gene deletions and is explained by a slipped-strand mispairing mechanism (Levinson and Gutman 1987). The mechanism leading to the loss of one or the",
        "other complete NRPS gene clusters (aer or mcn) in some Microcystis lineages (fig. 3) remains to be explored. A similar sporadic distribution of the microcystin synthetase gene cluster, not concordant with phylogenies based on",
        "housekeeping genes, was proposed to be the result of re-peated gene losses by a yet unknown mechanism, whereas horizontal transfer of entire gene clusters was considered unlikely (Rantala et al. 2004). The present study highlights the genetic basis for nat-ural product structural diversity exemplarily for NRPS-associated halogenase genes and chlorination of peptide products. Mechanisms such as HGT, recombination, and gene losses apparently result in a high plasticity of the ar-chitecture and functionality of strain-specific NRPS gene clusters, leading to a vast structural diversity of correspond-ing peptide products in closely related cyanobacteria. How the evolution of and rearrangements in cyanobacterial NRPS gene clusters actually come to pass is poorly under-stood yet, especially with regard to the lack of evidence for HGT in the genus Microcystis. An improved understanding of cyanobacterial combinatorial biosynthesis in vivo could be the base for the design and production of new pharma-ceuticals in the future.",
