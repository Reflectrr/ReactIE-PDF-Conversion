However, during the industrial production of A82846B, twomajor impurities, A82846A (63.6%) and A82846C (12%) which are structurally similar to A82846B (24.4%), are also produced. In this study, to improve the ratio of A82846B to A and C, the genes encoding halogenase in A82846B and vancomycin synthesis were integrated into A. orientalis SIPI18099 to test their halogenation ability, respectively. The results indicated that chal from the A82846B biosynthesis pathway was more efficient in reducing A and C factors. Moreover, by increasing the chal copy number, the proportion of A and C were gradually reduced while the titer and proportion of A82846B were improved. In a scaled-up industrial process, the proportion of A and C were decreased to 11.6% and 0.2% in the recombinant strain A.orientalis chal-3 with three gene copies of chal and the titers of A82846B (2.2 g/L) has increased by 2.8-folds compared to 780 mg/L produced by the parental strain, suggesting that the recombinant strain was suitable for the industrial production of A82846B with lower impurities. Keywords A82846B . Vancomycin . Amycolatopsis orientalis . Halogenase gene . Overexpression Introduction Resistance to Gram-positive bacteria has been increasingly threatening public health, such as the appearance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Edelsberg et al. 2014). Vancomycin was successfully used to treat MRSA in clinical practice for more than one decade; how-ever, the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in recent years has presented an urgent challenge to human health, which requires the development of new antibiotics against these path-ogens (Chang et al. 2003; Arthur and Courvalin 1993). A82846B, a vancomycin-like lipoglycopeptide, is the pre-cursor of the new semi-synthetic antibiotic, oritavancin (Fig. 1a), which was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused by Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA (Brade et al. 2016; Corey et al. 2014). Oritavancin is synthesized by adding a 4-(4-chlorophenyl) benzyl group to chloroeremomycin via re-ductive alkylation (Leadbetter et al. 2010). Compared with previous glycopeptide antibiotics, oritavancin has a prolonged half-life of about 200\u2013300 h, allowing for a single dose for a 7-day course of treatment, which makes it a promising drug for treating pathogen infections in both approved and unapproved treatments (Kaatz et al. 1998; Rupp et al. 2001). A82846 is a complex of structurally related components including A, B, and C constituents (Fig. 1a) produced by A. orientalis (Hamill et al. 1998). This antibiotic is structurally similar to heptapeptide antibiotics like vancomycin (Fig. 1b). Although the chemical structures of A82846A, A82846B, and A82846C only differ in their chlorine atom number, the sep-aration and purification of these compounds require very te-dious procedures (Rafai et al. 2016) including successive resin * Shao-Xin Chen sxzlb@263.net Wei-Yan Wang weiyan_cpu@163.com Song-Bai Yang yangsongbai5588@163.com Yuan-Jie Wu wu.yuanjie@163.com Xiao-Fang Shen shenxf_521@163.com 1 Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, Gebaini Road 285, Shanghai 201203, China Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2018) 102:5635\u20135643 https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-8983-8 chromatography and high-pressure preparatory chromatogra-phy. The complex and costly isolation process of A82846B has stressed the commercialization of oritavancin. Furthermore, since the antimicrobial activity and safety of some impurities are not clearly understood, the existence of those impurities might cause side effects, so it is urgent to find ways to reduce the levels of impurities. The current dilemma in industrial production of A82846B is to remove A82846A and A82846C. In our research, we proposed that the halogenation activity of chal (NCBI Accession No:AJ223998.1), which encodes halogenase, was not high enough in A82846B-producing strains, so we fo-cused on reducing A82846A and A82846C content by over-expressing the halogenase genes. This is the first example of lowering impurity levels by genetic manipulation, which rep-resents a cost-effective method for A82846B production. Materials and methods Strains, plasmids, and primers Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1; primers are listed in Table 2. described previously (Kieser et al. 2000). The E. coli ET12567/ pUZ8002 containing the plasmid was grown in the presence of antibiotics (50 mg/L apramycin, 25 mg/L chloramphenicol, and 50 mg/L kanamycin) to an OD600 of 0.4\u20130.6. The cells were washed twice with an equal volume of LB medium and resus-pended in 2 mL LB medium. The A. orientalis SIPI18099 was incubated in 25 mL TSB medium (15 g tryptone, 5 g soy pep-tone, 5 g NaCl, 15 g agar in 1 L tap water, pH 6.8\u20137.0) at 28\u00b0C for 48 h, then 10% of the culture was transferred into 25mLTSB medium for 36-h growth. Mycelium was collected by centrifu-gation and resuspended in 2 mL LB. Mix 2-mL ET12567/ pUZ8002 cells and the resuspended A. orientalis SIPI18099 and spread the mixture on mannitol-soya (MS) plates. The plates were incubated for 16\u201320 h at 28\u00b0C and then overlaid with 1 mL water containing 1 \u03bcg nalidixic acid and 200 \u03bcg apramycin. The plates were incubated again for 7\u201310 days at 28\u00b0C until the exconjugants were obtained. The exconjugants were then trans-ferred onto slant medium containing 50 mg/L apramycin. The recombinant strains were designated as A. orientalis vhal, A. orientalis chal, A. orientalis chal-2, A. orientalis chal-3, and A. orientalis SET152, respectively. Culture of A. orientalis The parental and recombinant A. orientalis strains were grown on solid medium containing 10 g/L soy peptone, 10 g/L Table 1 Strains and plasmids used in this study Strains or plasmids Description Source or reference Plasmid vectors pSET152 E. coli\u2013Streptomyces shuttle vector, Apr, Streptomyces \u03c6C31 integration site (attP) Bierman et al.

For fermentation culture, a 1-cm2 agar piece was transferred into a 250-mL flask with 20mL seedmedium containing 3 g/Lyeast extract, 11 g/L polypeptone, 3 g/L malt extract, and 11 g/L glucose pH 6.8\u20137.0, and incubated at 28\u00b0C, 200 rpm for 72 h. Then 10% seed culture was inoculated into a 250-mL flask with 30 mL production medium containing 8 g/L glucose, 0.6 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L maltodextrin, 0.54 g/L KCl, 0.5 g/L CaCO3, 0.017 g/L KH2PO4, and pH 6.5\u20136.7, and incubated at 28\u00b0C, 200 rpm for 6 days. Selection procedures of A. orientalis SIPI18099 Strain A. orientalis SIPI18099 was selected by the following procedures: NRRL18099 was the original strain and it was naturally separated for three times on solid medium described above. The obtained strain was named SIPI-S-32 in this pro-cedure, then suspension of this strain was induced with 1 mg/ mL NTG for 40 min and strain SIPI-N-101 selected from this procedure was used for next UV mutant for 90 s. Each selec-tion course had improved the yield of A82846B to a certain extent, and the A. orientalis SIPI18099 was finally screened out as the original strain in our study. Production of A82846B in 5-L fermenter To investigate A82846 production, 2-to 3-cm2 agar pieces of the A. orientalis SIPI18099 or A. orientalis chal-3 from slant medi-umwere cultured in 750-mL flaskswith 100mL seedmedium at 33\u00b0C, 200 rpm, for 48 h and then 10% seed culture was inocu-lated into 2 L production medium in a 5-L fermenter. The fer-mentation temperature was kept at 34\u00b0C. The pHwas adjusted to 6.7 with NaOH at the beginning, and during the fermentation process, this value was automatically kept at about 6.5\u20137.0 with NH3\u00b72H2O. Fifty percent glucose solution was added when the content of glucose dropped below 1.0%, and its concentration was kept at about 3.0\u20135.0% during the fermentation period. Analytic method One milliliter of culture broth was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 20 min to remove the cells, then the supernatant was diluted tenfold and determined using HPLC with a gradient elution pro-gram (0\u219220 min, A:B = 95:5\u219285:15; 20\u219225 min, A:B = 85:15\u219295:5) in an Agilent C18 chromatographic column (4.6 \u00d7 150, 3.5 \u03bcm, Agilent, USA) with mobile phases of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A), acetonitrile (B) at 1.0 mL/min, and detec-tion at 235 nm. To measure biomass (PMV%), 10 mL fermenta-tion broth was centrifuged for 20 min, 12000 rpm. Measure the volume of supernatant (v), the value of (10-v) 100%/10 was the biomass which could reflect the growth of the strains. Assay of transcript levels by QRT-PCR analysis Total RNAs from A. orientalis SIPI18099 and A. orientalis chal, A. orientalis chal-2, and A. orientalis chal-3were isolat-ed from 5-and 6-day fermentation cultures of each strain. The mycelia were suspended in TRIzon Reagent (CWBIO, China) after being thoroughly ground. Ultrapure RNA Kit (CWBIO, China) was used for RNA isolation. To obtain cDNAs, DNA in the sample was eliminated using RNase-free DNase (Promega, USA). Then, reverse transcription was performed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, USA). The transcript levels of the chal gene were assayed in a Bio-Rad iQ5 Real-Time PCR System; RT-PCR was performed with a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) with the fol-lowing program: 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, 60 \u00b0C for 20 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 20 s. To assess the transcript level of the 16s rRNA gene (as a control), RT16s-F/ R was used to amplify a 407-bp fragment in the 16s rRNA gene sequence in A. orientalis SIPI18099. For assessing the transcript level of the chal gene, RTchal-pF/R was used as the primer to amplify chal. Results Production of A82846B by A. orientalis SIPI18099 The A. orientalis SIPI18099 used in this study is an industrial strain used to produce A82846B, which has high yield of A82846B due to a series of selections from A. orientalis NRRL18099. A fed-batch culture was carried out in a 5-L fermenter. As can be seen in Fig. 2, during the whole fermen-tation process, A. orientalis SIPI18099 produced a high titer of A82846A andA82846C, and the maximum yield of A82846B, A, and C was around 780,2000, and 370 mg/L, respectively, at about 140 h. A82846B was only about 24.2% of the total A82846 components. Traditional methods such as optimizing the culture medium and fermentation techniques as well as Fig. 2 The A82846 produced by A. orientalis SIPI18099 in a 5-L fermentation process at different culture times. Levels of A82846A, B, and Cwere analyzed byHPLC. The values shown are the average of three determinations 5638 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:5635\u20135643 optimizing the strain by mutation have much randomness and might be difficult to obtain satisfied strain with low impurities. Overexpression of vhal and chal in A. orientalis SIPI18099 In the biosynthesis of some antibiotics, halogenase is responsi-ble for FADH2-dependent chlorination reactions (Puk et al. 2002; Dorrestein et al. 2005). We speculate that the halogenase activity in A. orientalis is not high enough to completely chlo-rinate the B component. To enhance halogenation activity, we overexpressed the halogenase gene. The protein encoded by ORF18 which named chal here in chloroeremomycin biosyn-thesis pathway (Van Wageningen et al. 1998) was aligned with the protein encoded by vhal encoding vancomycin halogenase (Xu et al. 2014), bhaA encoding balhimycin halogenase (Puk et al. 2002) and the gene named thal here encoding teicoplanin halogenase (Li et al. 2004), respectively, and they showed high identity (Fig. 3), suggesting that chal might be responsible for the halogenation of A82846. Two plasmids, pvhal152 and pchal152, containing vhal and chal expression cassettes, respectively, controlled by a strong promoter ermE* were constructed. Then, these plasmids were introduced into A. orientalis SIPI18099 by conjugal transforma-tion and selected on apramycin-containing media to obtain re-combinant strains A. orientalis vhal and A. orientalis chal, re-spectively. The plasmids pvhal152 and pchal152were integrated into the chromosome of A. orientalis SIPI18099 via the \u03c6C31 integration site (attP). The recombinant strains were cultured in a shake flask to determine the fermentation products. As shown in Fig. 4a, A. orientalis chal produced slightly more A82846B compared to production by the parental strain, and the ratios of factors A, B, and C were 43, 54, and 3%, respectively, which displayed an obvious change from ratios of the parental strains (66% A, 24% B, 10% C). Expression of vhal also lowered the A82846C production, but the ratio of A to B was much higher than that of A. orientalis chal. The result indicated that chal from Fig. 3 Alignment of proteins encoded by chal, vhal, bhaA and thal in the align program, chal has 93.5% sequence identity with vhal, 95.5% with bhaA, and 85.1% with thal. a b Fig. 4 a Comparison of yield of A82846 analogs in control strain, A. orientalis vhal, and A. orientalis chal.

Each strain was cultured in a shake flask for 6 days. A82846 production values shown are the average of three determinations Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:5635\u20135643 5639 A. orientalis SIPI18099 itself is more efficient than vhal in re-ducing impurities during A82846 fermentation. Effects of chal copy number on A82846 production Since introducing one copy of chal was effective in reducing impurities, we increased the copy number of the chal gene. Expression cassettes containing two chal genes and three chal genes were separately constructed and integrated into A. orientalis SIPI18099 to generate the recombinant strains A. orientalis chal-2 and chal-3 (Fig. 5a). The genetically engineered strains were cultured in shake flasks for 6 days, and the fermentation broth samples were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5b). As shown in Fig. 4b, with increasing chal copy number, the contents of A82846A and C were gradually lowered, and factor B became the major component in the fermentation broth. For A. orientalis chal-2, the proportions of A and C in total A82846 were 38 and 1.7%, while in A. orientalis chal-3, the proportions of A and C dropped to 22.5% and below 1.0%, respectively. Besides reducing the impurities, the titer of A82846B was also improved by increasing the chal copy number; the production of A82846B improved by 23% (831 mg/L) in A. orientalis chal-3 in comparison with parental strain (678 mg/L). The results suggested that overexpressing chal in the parental strain is a highly effective way to reduce structural analogs.

The values shown are the average of three determinations Fig. 6 Relative transcript levels of chal gene in recombinant strains compared with that in the parental strain, the total RNAs of each strain were extracted after 5 and 6 days of flask culture 5640 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:5635\u20135643 In addition, the biomass was around 25 \u00b1 5% with no obvious difference among engineered and wild-type strains, indicating that increasing the copy number of this gene did not affect strain growth. Assay of the transcript levels of chal by QRT-PCR analysis RT-PCR was carried out to assay chal gene transcript levels in parental and recombinant strains. The transcript level of the 16s rRNA gene fragment served as a control gene in this test. As the data shows in Fig. 6, the transcript levels of chal in strains A. orientalis chal, A. orientalis chal-2, and A. orientalis chal-3were about 6-fold, 6.5-fold and 7.5-fold of that in strain SIPI18099 (set as 1) in the 5th day, while in the 6th day, the transcript level were about 7-fold, 23-fold, and 46-fold, indi-cating that the transcript levels of chal genes were obviously increased in the overexpressing strains, and increasing chal copy number significantly affected the transcriptional level of this gene. This result is consistent with the reduced produc-tion of A and C impurities and enhanced production of A82846B in recombinant strains. Scaled-up culture of A. orientalis chal-3 in 5-L fermenter The production of A82846B by A. orientalis chal-3 was car-ried out in a 5-L fermenter. The fermentation process is shown in Fig. 7. During the culture process, the pH value gradually rose from 0 to 80 h and thereafter was maintained at 6.8 \u00b1 0.2 by adding 3 mol/L ammonium solution. The glucose was rapidly consumed before 60 h and then was controlled at about 3.0-5.0% by feeding 50% glucose solution. As can be seen, the proportion of impurities in scaled-up fermentation of the recombinant strain remained at a low level, while higher A82846 yields were obtained compared with that in flask culture. The maximum production of A82846B, A, and C was 2200, 290, and 56 mg/L, respectively, at about 140 h. The results suggested that A82846C was nearly eliminated in A. orientalis chal-3 and the A82846A proportion decreased to 11.6%; meanwhile, the yield of A82846B was nearly three-fold of that in the wild-type strain A. orientalis SIPI18099 in the same fermentation conditions (Table 3). During fermenta-tion, few differences in growth pattern were found between the engineered and parental strains, indicating that the hered-itary characters of A. orientalis chal-3 were quite stable. The fermentation broth could be purified by normal-pressure chro-matography to obtain high-purity A82846B for semi-synthesizing oritavancin, thereby avoiding high-pressure pre-paratory chromatography used in industrial production. Therefore, the A. orientalis chal-3 allows for a simple and cost-effective fermentation process to produce A82846B.

Heterogeneous expression and over-expression of some regulatory genes and biosynthetic structural genes have been used to alter the production of secondary me-tabolites (Lee et al. 2016; Olano et al. 2008; Shao et al. 2010). In 1998, van Wageningen et al. sequenced and analyzed the genes involved in chloroeremomycin biosynthesis. Through sequence comparisons, they annotated that the enzymes encoded by ORF18 and ORF10 were non-heme haloperoxidases and haloperoxidase that were responsible for chlorinating residues 2 and 6 of chloroeremomycin. However, ORF10 and 18 showed relatively low homologies in the report due to lack of enough microorganisms\u2019 genomic data in early study (24\u201329% identity to haloperoxidases found, 20% identity to haloperoxidase). Secondary metabolites with similar structures often share similar biosynthetic pathways. The chemical structures of vancomycin-type antibiotics such as balhimycin and chloroeremomycin have the similar heptapeptide core and have similarities in their bio-synthetic pattern (Hubbard andWalsh 2003; Puk et al. 2004). By sequence re-analysis, we found the ORF18 showed 93.5% amino-acid sequence identity with the vhal gene in the vanco-mycin biosynthetic pathway, and 95.3% identity with the bhaA (NCBI Accession No: Y16952.3) gene in balhimycin biosynthesis. Deleting bhaA yields dechloro-balhimycin (Puk et al. 2002), and deleting vhal also abolishes halogenation of vancomycin, indicating that a single halogenase is required for chlorinating balhimycin and vancomycin, respectively. We also found that ORF10 showed similarities to perhydrolases of balhimycin and vancomycin (83.2 and 85.6% identity), suggest-ing that ORF10 is a perhydrolase rather than a haloperoxidase. Therefore, only ORF18 is responsible for chlorinating residues 2 and 6. Also, the fact that overexpressingORF18 has significantly enhanced the content of A82846B suggests that this gene en-codes a halogenase catalyzing both aromatic residues of A82846B. Many glycopeptide antibiotics are characterized by the pres-ence of chlorine atoms, which are strikingly important for antibi-otic activity (Gerhard et al. 1993; Harris et al. 1985). However, the biosynthetic step during which halogenation takes place is still unclear, and the actual substrates for halogenation also have not been identified (Puk et al. 2004; Xu et al. 2014). Given the fact that vancomycin has two chlorine substitutes without any mono-or non-chlorine analogs in current industrial production, introduc-ing the halogenase gene for vancomycin could theoretically help reduce the generation of A82846A and C as well as enhance the main product A82846B. But as the results showed, vhal was less effective than chal in reducing impurities in spite of its high ho-mology with chal, indicating that halogenases from different sources have different substrate specificity. By overexpressing the endogenous A82846B halogenase gene, the halogenation ca-pability significantly improved and the halogenase activity in-creased with increased chal copy number. The enhanced halogenase level can catalyze more substrates to synthesize a product with two chlorine atoms. On the other hand, fed-batch fermentation in the 5-L fermenter showed increased antibiotic production compared to that in flask culture, indicating that suffi-cient carbon source by feeding glucose and sufficient oxygen through aeration and agitation are beneficial for mycelium growth and A82846B production. Above all, this study demonstrates for the first time that overexpressing halogenase canmodify the chlorination pattern of glycopeptide antibiotics. Then, we developed an engineered strain which could be used in the industrial production of A82846B with much lower levels of components A82846A and A82846C.

        "Abstract The glycopeptide antibiotic A82846B (chloroeremomycin) produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis is the precursor of the semi-synthetic antibiotic oritavancin. However, during the industrial production of A82846B, twomajor impurities, A82846A (63.6%) and A82846C (12%) which are structurally similar to A82846B (24.4%), are also produced. In this study, to improve the ratio of A82846B to A and C, the genes encoding halogenase in A82846B and vancomycin synthesis were integrated into A. orientalis SIPI18099 to test their halogenation ability, respectively. The results indicated that chal from the A82846B biosynthesis pathway was more efficient in reducing A and C factors. Moreover, by increasing the chal copy number, the proportion of A and C were gradually reduced while the titer and proportion of A82846B were improved. In a scaled-up industrial process, the proportion of A and C were decreased to 11.6% and 0.2% in the recombinant strain A.orientalis chal-3 with three gene copies of chal and the titers of A82846B (2.2 g/L) has increased by 2.8-folds compared to 780 mg/L produced by the parental strain, suggesting that the recombinant strain was suitable for the industrial production of A82846B with lower impurities.",

        "Introduction",
        "Resistance to Gram-positive bacteria has been increasingly threatening public health, such as the appearance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Edelsberg et al. 2014). Vancomycin was successfully used to treat MRSA in clinical practice for more than one decade; how-ever, the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in recent years has presented an urgent challenge to human health, which requires the development of new antibiotics against these path-ogens (Chang et al. 2003; Arthur and Courvalin 1993).",
        "A82846B, a vancomycin-like lipoglycopeptide, is the pre-cursor of the new semi-synthetic antibiotic, oritavancin (Fig. 1a), which was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused by Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA (Brade et al. 2016; Corey et al. 2014). Oritavancin is synthesized by adding a 4-(4-chlorophenyl) benzyl group to chloroeremomycin via re-ductive alkylation (Leadbetter et al. 2010). Compared with previous glycopeptide antibiotics, oritavancin has a prolonged half-life of about 200\u2013300 h, allowing for a single dose for a 7-day course of treatment, which makes it a promising drug for treating pathogen infections in both approved and unapproved treatments (Kaatz et al. 1998; Rupp et al. 2001).",
        "A82846 is a complex of structurally related components including A, B, and C constituents (Fig. 1a) produced by A. orientalis (Hamill et al. 1998). This antibiotic is structurally similar to heptapeptide antibiotics like vancomycin (Fig. 1b). Although the chemical structures of A82846A, A82846B, and A82846C only differ in their chlorine atom number, the sep-aration and purification of these compounds require very te-dious procedures (Rafai et al. 2016) including successive resin",

        "chromatography and high-pressure preparatory chromatogra-phy. The complex and costly isolation process of A82846B has stressed the commercialization of oritavancin. Furthermore, since the antimicrobial activity and safety of some impurities are not clearly understood, the existence of those impurities might cause side effects, so it is urgent to find ways to reduce the levels of impurities.",
        "The current dilemma in industrial production of A82846B is to remove A82846A and A82846C. In our research, we proposed that the halogenation activity of chal (NCBI Accession No:AJ223998.1), which encodes halogenase, was not high enough in A82846B-producing strains, so we fo-cused on reducing A82846A and A82846C content by over-expressing the halogenase genes. This is the first example of lowering impurity levels by genetic manipulation, which rep-resents a cost-effective method for A82846B production.",

Besides reducing the impurities, the titer of A82846B was also improved by increasing the chal copy number; the production of A82846B improved by 23% (831 mg/L) in A. orientalis chal-3 in comparison with parental strain (678 mg/L). The results suggested that overexpressing chal in the parental strain is a highly effective way to reduce structural analogs.",

        "Assay of the transcript levels of chal by QRT-PCR analysis",
        "RT-PCR was carried out to assay chal gene transcript levels in parental and recombinant strains. The transcript level of the 16s rRNA gene fragment served as a control gene in this test. As the data shows in Fig. 6, the transcript levels of chal in strains A. orientalis chal, A. orientalis chal-2, and A. orientalis chal-3were about 6-fold, 6.5-fold and 7.5-fold of that in strain SIPI18099 (set as 1) in the 5th day, while in the 6th day, the transcript level were about 7-fold, 23-fold, and 46-fold, indi-cating that the transcript levels of chal genes were obviously increased in the overexpressing strains, and increasing chal copy number significantly affected the transcriptional level of this gene. This result is consistent with the reduced produc-tion of A and C impurities and enhanced production of A82846B in recombinant strains.",
        "Scaled-up culture of A. orientalis chal-3 in 5-L fermenter",
        "The production of A82846B by A. orientalis chal-3 was car-ried out in a 5-L fermenter. The fermentation process is shown in Fig. 7. During the culture process, the pH value gradually rose from 0 to 80 h and thereafter was maintained at 6.8 \u00b1 0.2 by adding 3 mol/L ammonium solution. The glucose was rapidly consumed before 60 h and then was controlled at about 3.0-5.0% by feeding 50% glucose solution. As can be seen, the proportion of impurities in scaled-up fermentation of the recombinant strain remained at a low level, while higher A82846 yields were obtained compared with that in flask culture. The maximum production of A82846B, A, and C was 2200, 290, and 56 mg/L, respectively, at about 140 h. The results suggested that A82846C was nearly eliminated in A. orientalis chal-3 and the A82846A proportion decreased to 11.6%; meanwhile, the yield of A82846B was nearly three-fold of that in the wild-type strain A. orientalis SIPI18099 in the same fermentation conditions (Table 3). During fermenta-tion, few differences in growth pattern were found between the engineered and parental strains, indicating that the hered-itary characters of A. orientalis chal-3 were quite stable. The fermentation broth could be purified by normal-pressure chro-matography to obtain high-purity A82846B for semi-synthesizing oritavancin, thereby avoiding high-pressure pre-paratory chromatography used in industrial production. Therefore, the A. orientalis chal-3 allows for a simple and cost-effective fermentation process to produce A82846B.",

        "of biosynthetic pathways. Heterogeneous expression and over-expression of some regulatory genes and biosynthetic structural genes have been used to alter the production of secondary me-tabolites (Lee et al. 2016; Olano et al. 2008; Shao et al. 2010). In 1998, van Wageningen et al. sequenced and analyzed the genes involved in chloroeremomycin biosynthesis. Through sequence comparisons, they annotated that the enzymes encoded by ORF18 and ORF10 were non-heme haloperoxidases and haloperoxidase that were responsible for chlorinating residues 2 and 6 of chloroeremomycin. However, ORF10 and 18 showed relatively low homologies in the report due to lack of enough microorganisms\u2019 genomic data in early study (24\u201329% identity to haloperoxidases found, 20% identity to haloperoxidase). Secondary metabolites with similar structures often share similar biosynthetic pathways. The chemical structures of vancomycin-type antibiotics such as balhimycin and chloroeremomycin have the similar heptapeptide core and have similarities in their bio-synthetic pattern (Hubbard andWalsh 2003; Puk et al. 2004). By sequence re-analysis, we found the ORF18 showed 93.5% amino-acid sequence identity with the vhal gene in the vanco-mycin biosynthetic pathway, and 95.3% identity with the bhaA (NCBI Accession No: Y16952.3) gene in balhimycin biosynthesis. Deleting bhaA yields dechloro-balhimycin (Puk et al. 2002), and deleting vhal also abolishes halogenation of vancomycin, indicating that a single halogenase is required for chlorinating balhimycin and vancomycin, respectively. We also found that ORF10 showed similarities to perhydrolases of balhimycin and vancomycin (83.2 and 85.6% identity), suggest-ing that ORF10 is a perhydrolase rather than a haloperoxidase. Therefore, only ORF18 is responsible for chlorinating residues 2 and 6. Also, the fact that overexpressingORF18 has significantly enhanced the content of A82846B suggests that this gene en-codes a halogenase catalyzing both aromatic residues of A82846B.",
        "Many glycopeptide antibiotics are characterized by the pres-ence of chlorine atoms, which are strikingly important for antibi-otic activity (Gerhard et al. 1993; Harris et al. 1985). However, the biosynthetic step during which halogenation takes place is still unclear, and the actual substrates for halogenation also have not been identified (Puk et al. 2004; Xu et al. 2014). Given the fact that vancomycin has two chlorine substitutes without any mono-or non-chlorine analogs in current industrial production, introduc-ing the halogenase gene for vancomycin could theoretically help reduce the generation of A82846A and C as well as enhance the main product A82846B. But as the results showed, vhal was less effective than chal in reducing impurities in spite of its high ho-mology with chal, indicating that halogenases from different sources have different substrate specificity. By overexpressing the endogenous A82846B halogenase gene, the halogenation ca-pability significantly improved and the halogenase activity in-creased with increased chal copy number. The enhanced halogenase level can catalyze more substrates to synthesize a product with two chlorine atoms. On the other hand, fed-batch fermentation in the 5-L fermenter showed increased antibiotic production compared to that in flask culture, indicating that suffi-cient carbon source by feeding glucose and sufficient oxygen through aeration and agitation are beneficial for mycelium growth and A82846B production.",
        "Above all, this study demonstrates for the first time that overexpressing halogenase canmodify the chlorination pattern of glycopeptide antibiotics. Then, we developed an engineered strain which could be used in the industrial production of A82846B with much lower levels of components A82846A and A82846C.",
