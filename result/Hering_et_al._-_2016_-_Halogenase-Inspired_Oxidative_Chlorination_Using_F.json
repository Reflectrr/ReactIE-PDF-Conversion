Nature chlorinates with chloride anions, FAD-depen-dent halogenases, and O2 as the oxidant. A photocatalytic oxidative chlorination is described based on the organic dye riboflavin tetraacetate mimicking the enzymatic process. The chemical process allows within the suitable arene redox potential window a broader substrate scope compared to the specific activation in the enzymatic binding pocket. Chlorinated aromatic compounds are ubiq-uitous in organic chemistry. They serve as key precursors for metal-catalyzed cross-cou-plings and are widely employed in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and materials sci-ence to tune biological or electronic proper-ties.[1] While traditional chemistry mostly relies on the use of hazardous and toxic chlorine gas or synthetic equivalents such as NCS and tBuOCl as the source of electro-philic chlorine, nature has developed a more elegant strategy based on the enzymatically catalyzed oxidation of abundant and non-toxic chloride ions in an oxidative chlorina-tion.[2] Halogenases efficiently yield aryl hal-ides from halide ions and aromatic com-pounds using either O2 or hydrogen peroxide (haloperoxidases) as the oxidant.[3] With respect to environmental factors, these are the ideal oxidants as only water is produced as a by-product. For this reason a variety of chemical oxidative halogenations have been developed.[2] However, while great progress has been made in the area of oxidative bromination, oxidative chlorination remains challenging. The few examples known suffer from drastic conditions and low selectivity[2, 4] or rely on stronger or metal-based stoichiometric oxidants.[5] Over the last years, halogen-ases have been successfully isolated and used for the halogenation (mostly bromination) of aromatic compounds.[6] These reactions show high selectivity and have also been scaled up to gram amounts,[6b] but as the enzymes are naturally substrate specific the scope of accessible products is limited, and the isolation and handling of the enzymes is difficult. We aimed to develop a biomimetic system inspired by flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent halogenases, which is one of the main families of this enzyme group.[3a] The FAD dependent system combines several advantages: O2 is used as oxidant avoiding the separate addition of H2O2 as required for heme and vanadate dependent haloperoxidases. The cofactor FAD is a purely organic, metal-free catalyst, and simple flavin derivatives are known to act as oxidative photocatalysts.[7] The enzymatic mechanism (Scheme 1) involves the reduction of FAD by NADH2 to yield a reduced FADH2, which reacts with oxygen to form a peroxo species FAD-OOH that is subsequently attacked by chloride ions to form the \u201cCl+\u201d equivalent HOCl.[8] Our system replaces FAD Scheme 1. Analogy of the mechanistic model of chloride oxidation by FAD-dependent by the cheap dye riboflavin tetraacetate (RFT), which is known to form reduced RFTH2 upon excitation with visible light in the presence of benzyl alcohols (Scheme 1).[7] This allows us to replace the biomolecules FAD and NADH2 and to perform the reactions in organic solvents using a stable and inexpensive catalyst. A key challenge in developing a photocatalytic halogen-ase mimetic system is the efficient generation of electrophilic hypochlorite. In analogy to the enzymatic system, RFTH2 forms a short-lived flavin-peroxo species RFT-OOH, which should oxidize chloride ions to OCl\u00a2 (Scheme 1). However, in the enzyme the reaction of the flavin peroxide to form hypochlorite and the subsequent chlorination of the substrate are catalyzed by the complex enzyme environment. For enzymes such as RebH the mediation by a lysine residue in the active center is crucial for the reactivity and selectivity of the reaction. Moreover, X-ray studies of halogenases have shown that the substrate and the flavin peroxide (FAD-OOH) are brought in very close proximity (ca. 10 \u00e8) before a reaction takes place.[3a, 9] This is also the reason why the simple chemical system, using anisole (1) as the substrate, 10 mol% RFT as the photocatalyst under aerobic conditions and irradiation with blue light (lmax = 455 nm) in the presence of HCl as the chloride source and p-methoxy benzyl alcohol (pMBA) as a replacement for NADH2 in 2 mL acetonitrile, did not yield any chlorination product of anisole (Scheme 2). To chemically mimic the enzymatic system, a mediator is needed, which is sufficiently long lived in order to enable the formation of perchloric acid. During the course of our investigations we discovered that peracetic acid can oxidize chloride ions and is able to perform oxidative chlorination of aromatic compounds (Supporting Information, Table S2).[10] Peracetic acid is highly explosive when isolated, but it can be formed in equilibrium with acetic acid and H2O2. [11] As it is known that RFT-OOH formed in the photocatalytic oxida-tion quickly releases one equivalent of H2O2, [7a] we added 10 equiv of acetic acid to the system described above and, to our delight, observed the chlorination of anisole (1). Control reactions showed that all reaction components are essential to observe the chlorination reaction (Supporting Information, Table S1). Based on this we propose an in situ formation of peracetic acid as depicted in Figure 1, which acts as the described mediator and enables the chlorination via the following reaction cycle. In the first step, the photocatalyst RFT is excited by visible light irradiation (lmax = 455 nm) to RFT* and reduced to RFTH2 by oxidation of the benzylic alcohol (pMBA). RFTH2 is re-oxidized by air forming H2O2, which does not directly oxidize chloride, but forms peracetic acid (HOOAc) in an equilibrium with acetic acid (HOAc). The hereby in situ generated HOOAc subsequently reacts with chloride to form the electrophilic chlorine species HOCl, which attacks anisole (1) in an electrophilic aromatic sub-stitution reaction. However, we cannot exclude other electro-philic chlorine species in equilibrium with HOCl, for example, Cl2O, ClOAc, Cl2, and H2OCl +, being involved.[4b,12] With this mechanistic model in hand, we optimized the reaction conditions for the highest formation of peracetic acid (see the Supporting Information). The equilibrium of H2O2 and acetic acid is known to be shifted towards the side of peracetic acid by strong acids.[11a] Therefore, hydrochloric acid proved to be the ideal chloride source as it dissolved well in acetonitrile and is a strong acid at the same time. The reaction with triethylammonium chloride (TEACl) and 20 mol% H2SO4 also led to product formation, but with a slightly lower yield. No chlorination was observed with any of the tested chloride salts (TEACl, NaCl, KCl, and NH4Cl) in the absence of added acid. Furthermore, elevated temperatures are known to be beneficial for peracetic acid formation.[11b] An increase of the reaction temperature from 25 8C to 45 8C improved the yield of chloroanisole (2) from 28 % to 66% (p:o 5:1); a further increase to 60 8C led to decomposition of the photocatalyst (Supporting Information, Table S4). We also varied the peracid and replaced acetic acid by the stronger acids formic acid and triflic acid (Supporting Information, Table S3). Formic acid showed significantly lower yields than acetic acid, while triflic acid with 5 equiv TEACl and 5 equiv HCl gave a comparable yield of the chlorinated anisole. Alternative reagents for the generation of peracetic acid such as acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride enabled product formation, but were less efficient than acetic acid. The optimized conditions depicted in Scheme 3 were used to investigate the substrate scope. While an enzyme usually has a highly specific binding pocket and thus a narrow substrate scope, but high selectivity, our system does not bind the substrate and should allow a broader substrate scope. The results are summarized in Table 1. The system works excel-lently for arenes with nitrogen + M substituents such as N,N-dimethylaniline (entry 1) or amides (entries 2,3). Substrates with an alkoxy group, such as anisole (entry 4) or dipheny-lether (entry 5), can also be successfully chlorinated in good to moderate yields. When the arene is too electron-rich, as for Scheme 2. Test reaction for the chlorination of anisole (1) with the example in dimethoxybenzene carrying two + M-substituents, the yield decreases due to the unselective direct oxidation of the substrate by the photocatalyst (entry 6). The acidic conditions lead to a protonation of RFT observable by UV/ VIS measurements (Supporting Information, Tables S4, S5). In its protonated form, RFT is known to have a high oxidative power.[13] Substrates, which are too electron poor, for example, trifluoromethoxybenzene (entry 7), are not attacked by hypochlorite and do not give chlorination products neither in the photocatalytic system nor when peracetic acid is added directly (Supporting Information, Table S2). Acetophenones (entries 9, 10) are mono-chlori-nated in the a-position. The reaction proceeds via the enol form and therefore works better when the stronger triflic acid is used instead of acetic acid.[14] It is worth noting that aromatic amines (entries 1, 8) show ortho selectivity for the chlorination. This may be explained by the intermediate formation of an N-chloramine. This selectivity is not observed with amides (entries 2, 3). For comparison, Table 1 also shows the yields of chlorination obtained by adding 6 equiv of H2O2 directly to the reaction mix-ture instead of being generated by the photocatalytic process (reaction contained no RFT and pMBA). Even though the direct addition of H2O2 always gave full conversion of the substrate, the yields were con-siderably lower for most substrates than in the photocatalytic system. The slow generation of peroxide by the flavin-catalyzed process is ben-eficial for the reaction as it circum-vents the problem of unselective side reactions and over-chlorination often observed for H2O2-based sys-tems. The same observation was made for haloperoxidase-catalyzed reactions.[6e] In conclusion, visible-light flavin photocatalysis allows the oxi-dative chlorination of arenes inspired by FAD-dependent halo-genases. The biomolecules FAD and NADH2 were replaced by the cheap organic dye riboflavin tetraa-cetate and methoxy benzyl alcohol as the reducing agent. As a result, the reaction can be performed in organic media. Acetic acid was added to the system forming per-acetic acid in situ, which acts as a mediator to activate the peroxide for chloride oxidation. Compared to the specific binding pocket of an enzyme, the activation by peracetic acid is a more general strategy and thus allows a broader substrate scope. The developed system allows the chlorination of electron rich arenes, for example, anisole, methylanilines, diphenyl ether, and amides, as well as the a-chlorination of acetophenones.

This may be explained by the intermediate",
        "formation of an N-chloramine. This selectivity is not observed with amides (entries 2, 3). For comparison, Table 1 also shows the yields of chlorination obtained by adding 6 equiv of H2O2 directly to the reaction mix-ture instead of being generated by the photocatalytic process (reaction contained no RFT and pMBA). Even though the direct addition of H2O2 always gave full conversion of the substrate, the yields were con-siderably lower for most substrates than in the photocatalytic system. The slow generation of peroxide by the flavin-catalyzed process is ben-eficial for the reaction as it circum-vents the problem of unselective side reactions and over-chlorination often observed for H2O2-based sys-tems. The same observation was made for haloperoxidase-catalyzed reactions.[6e] In conclusion, visible-light flavin photocatalysis allows the oxi-dative chlorination of arenes inspired by FAD-dependent halo-genases. The biomolecules FAD and NADH2 were replaced by the cheap organic dye riboflavin tetraa-cetate and methoxy benzyl alcohol as the reducing agent. As a result, the reaction can be performed in organic media. Acetic acid was added to the system forming per-acetic acid in situ, which acts as a mediator to activate the peroxide for chloride oxidation. Compared to the specific binding pocket of an enzyme, the activation by peracetic acid is a more general strategy and",
        "thus allows a broader substrate scope. The developed system allows the chlorination of electron rich arenes, for example, anisole, methylanilines, diphenyl ether, and amides, as well as the a-chlorination of acetophenones.",
