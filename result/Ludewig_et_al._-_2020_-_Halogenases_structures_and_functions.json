Theintroduction of a halogen into a molecule can significantlyimpact its bioavailability and bioactivity. More recentlyenzymatic halogenation has been used to enable late stagefunctionalisation through site-selective halogenation andcross-coupling. Halogenases are becoming increasinglyvalued tools. This review outlines the various classes ofhalogenases that have been discovered, and examines thesefrom both a structural and a mechanistic perspective, reflectingupon the many recent advances in halogenase discovery.Address School of Chemistry, University of St Andrews, North Haugh, StAndrews, Fife, KY16 9ST, UKCorresponding author: Goss, Goss (rjmg@st-andrews.ac.uk)1 Present address: Department of Biochemistry, Brandeis University,Waltham, MA 02454, USA.2Present address: Howard Huges Medical Institute, Brandeis University,Waltham, MA 02454, USA.3Present Address: School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Universityof Leeds, Leeds, Yorkshire, LS3 9JT, UK.4 These authors contributed equally.Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2020, 65:51\u201360This review comes from a themed issue on Catalysis and regulationEdited by James H Naismith and Emily ParkerFor a complete overview see the Issue and the EditorialAvailable online 30th June 2020https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2020.05.012 0959-440X/\u00e3 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Introduction Halogenation of molecules can significantly impact theiractivity and bioavailability [1,2] and is a strategyemployed by both nature, and in bioactive moleculedesign, with 27% of small molecule drugs and more than80% of agrochemicals bearing a halogen [3,4]. Addition-ally, incorporation of Cl, Br, or I provides chemicallyreactive and orthogonal handles for selective modificationthrough cross-coupling chemistry [5]. Today, over5000 halometabolites, predominantly chlorinated andbrominated metabolites, have been identified [6None].Though more rare, approximately 100 iodinated naturalmetabolites and 6\u201313 natural, fluorinated metaboliteswww.sciencedirect.com have been found [6None]. This plethora of halometabolitesshow exciting structural diversity indicating the operationof a large variety of powerful enzymes [7].Though initially biosynthetic halogenation was consideredan artefact, the first enzyme capable of halogenation wasdiscovered by Lowell Hager et al. in 1959 [8NoneNone]. Thisenzyme was named chloroperoxidase (CPO), a haloperox-idase, from the fungus Calariomyces fumago [9]. For severaldecades the haloperoxidases remained the only halo-genases known [9]. However, the turn of the millenniumcorresponded to a significant acceleration in this researchfield, largely fuelled by investigations into the biogenesis ofnatural products from bacteria, fungi and plants. In the last5 years, bioinformatics led approaches have enabled theidentification of halogenases, even from viruses [10NoneNone,11NoneNone].Halogenases may be broadly classified by their mecha-nisms: electrophilic, nucleophilic, or radical, and may befurther subdivided according to their catalytic species.The vast majority of halogenases studied so far employelectrophilic halogenation, enabling incorporation of Cl,Br, and I [7]; in recent years increasing numbers of radicalhalogenases have been identified [12,13None,14None]. Nucleo-philic halogenases remain the most rare [15,16None].Here we overview the enzymatic mechanisms for eachclass of halogenase, reflecting upon the structures of theenzymes that mediate these chemistries.Nucleophilic halogenasesA small handful of nucleophilic halogenases are known sofar, the first of these, and the most well studied is thefluorinase or 50-fluoro-50-deoxyadenosine synthase (50-FDAS) from Streptomyces cattleya [17]. Though fluorine isthemost abundant halogenin the earth\u2019s crust, andthe 13thmost abundant element, few natural organofluorine com-pounds exist. This is perhaps dominated by three factors:the poor solubility of fluoride salts, the high enthalpy ofhydration of fluoride (490 kJ molNone1) and fluoride\u2019s electro-negativity, rendering it a poor nucleophile.50-FDAS, is responsible for the first step in the biogenesisof fluoroacetate and 4-fluoro-L-threonine from Streptomy-ces cattleya [17]. It mediates the nucleophilic attack offluoride onto S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), generat-ing 50-deoxy-50-fluoroadenosine (50-FDA) and L-methio-nine (Figure 1a) [15].

The N-terminal domainconsists of a central \u00df-sheet sitting in between seven a-heli-ces and an extensive loop connecting the last two \u00df-strands(see Figure 1b). The C-terminal domain is comprised of twoanti-parallel \u00df-sheets sandwiched by three short helices(Figure 1b). Within the trimer found in the asymmetric unit(ASU) of the crystal structure, intermolecular domain inter-facesareformedbetweenN-terminaldomainsofneighbour-ing monomers (relying on the aforementioned extendedloop (98\u2013114)) as well as contacts between N-terminaldomains and C-terminal domains of neighbouring mono-mers. A dimer of trimers may be seen within the crystalstructure, consistent with the hexameric solution state sug-gested by analytical size exclusion chromatography [15].Each of the three N-terminal to C-terminal domain inter-faces harbour SAM, fully encapsulating the substrate (seeFigure 1b). The ribose ring may be seen to adopt an unusual,high energy, eclipsed conformation (Figure 1c). Crystals of50-FDAS grown in the presence of potassium fluoride andSAM contained the product 50-FDA (shown to reside with arelaxed ribose ring conformation) and L-methionine locatedwithin the SAM binding site (PDB: 1RQR; see Figure 1c). Asmall pocket, identified as the fluoride binding site, com-prises of residues Y77, T80, F156 and S158 (Figure 1c),giving insight to the way in whichthe hydration sphere ofthe fluoride anion might be displaced [15].Hydroxyl and amide moieties of the S158 are proposed toform two hydrogen bonds to fluoride, crucial for loweringthe energetic cost for its necessary dehydration in order toproduce a more reactive nucleophile. The anti positioningof fluoride with regards to the C50and -S bond is consis-tent with an SN2 mechanism, and the observed inversionof configuration has been described by O\u2019Hagan et al.[18]. Further detailed mechanistic studies demonstratesubstrate inhibition by SAM, and requirement for fluoridebinding to 50-FDAS in advance of SAM, in order togenerate a productive complex [19]. Dehydration is pro-posed to reach completion upon binding of SAM. Thisresults in a more nucleophilic fluoride, potentially stabi-lised by T80 or the positively charged sulphur atom fromSAM, optimally orientated for the SN2 reaction, as sug-gested by the in silico studies of Vincent et al. [20].The mechanistically related SalL, involved in the bio-synthesis of the chlorinated metabolite salinosporamidemonomers are coloured in blue or white respectively. Carbon atoms belongare coloured light red, yellow and dark blue, respectively; (right) fluoride binstructure (PDB: 1RQR) represented as sticks. 50-FDAS carbon atoms are codepicted in orange.

Whilst chloride is the nativenucleophile, bromide and iodide, are shown to be poorbut processable substrates in vitro (Kmof 45, 150 and 260mM, respectively) [16None]. Structural investigations byMoore et al. [16None] revealed an identical monomeric foldcompared to 50-FDAS and a trimeric oligomeric state inboth the crystal structure and in solution. Crystal struc-tures of SalL show an enlarged halide binding pocketin which a glycine is in place of the serine (S158) of50-FDAS: absence of this serine results in the reducedability to dehydrate the nucleophile and the inability toprocess fluoride (PDB: 2Q6I). The inability to excludewater, is exemplified by the presence of the proximalwater molecule in the crystal structure [16None].Radical halogenasesAll known enzymatic radical halogenation reactions arecatalysed by non-heme-iron a-ketoglutarate (KG)-depen-dent enzymes; proteins which are able to selectivelyhalogenate an unactivated aliphatic carbon centre. AllFe(II)/a-KG halogenation proceeds by the same generalmechanism. The enzyme resting state (Figure 2a. I)generally consists of two active site histidine residues,a bidentate a-KG, a halide anion, and a weakly boundwater (which is displaced by substrate (Figure 2a. II))coordinating the Fe(II) centre. Dioxygen addition to theiron centre (Figure 2a. III) is followed by a decarbox-ylative event between the bound oxygen and a-KG,which leads to the formation a high energy Fe(IV) = Ointermediate (Figure 2a. IV) [22]. A radical deprotonationof the substrate C\u2013H bond ensues (Figure 2a. V). Theresultant alkyl radical reacts with the bound halide,generating the alkyl halide. Before the discovery ofWelO5, [21] all radical halogenases required substratesto be presented bound to a separate protein.WelO5 is responsible for halogenation of 12-epi-fischerin-dole U in Hapalosiphon welwischii, inspection of its structureprovides key insights into how these halogenases can bindfree molecules. It was the first Fe(II)/a-KG enzyme struc-ture to be solved (PDB: 5IQT) with its substrate bound inthe active site [12]. WelO5\u2019s 2.4 A\u030acrystal structure wassolvedtoshowthree monomers inthe ASU, with the proteinacting as a monomer in solution. Overall the structureconsists of the 8 stranded b-sandwich topology, or the bjelly roll motif of Fe(II)/a-KG proteins in the cupin super-family, which is surrounded by external a helicies. The Fe(II)/a-KG cofactor was shown to sit within this sandwich, aswith other cupin enzymes. A notable difference betweenWelO5 and halogenases in which the substrate is proteinbound, is the presence of an external a helix in theC-terminus (215\u2013232), which forms additional interactionsing to SAM are coloured orange.

This helix is postulated toinfluence substrate acceptance (this helix differs most insequence between the more promiscuous AmbO5, andmore substrate-specific WelO5*) [23None]. Substrate bindingalso causes conformational change causing F169 to blockthe large site expected for substrate. Instead F169 sits overH164 in a hydrophobic pocket closed by this external helix.The loop (residues 75\u201382) moves in to form a H-bond fromA82 nitrogen toNC carbon ofthe substrate,whilstana helixmethionine (M225) binds the substrate\u2019s NH (Figure 2b).These interactions position the free substrate over H164,such that the iron centre is 4.5 A\u030afrom the carbon to bechlorinated, but a considerable distance away from thebound chloride (5.7 A\u030a). Subsequent rearrangement ofligands around iron in the solved WelO5 structure, medi-ated by O2binding, is postulated to position the oxo ligandsuch that chlorination is preferred to hydroxylation [12].The NO bound structure (PDB: 5IQV) shows this ligandorientation. Outer sphere effects may also lead to specifichalogenation activity: S189 is theorised to form interactionswith the Fe(IV) = O oxygen, and a mutation to alanine hasbeen shown to reduce halogenation selectivity, possibly as aconsequence of altered ligand positioning. Interestingly adifferent orientation of a-KG is observed in free substrateradical halogenases, in which the C3\u2013C4 bond points out ofthe plane of the a-KG, chloride ion, and histidine, tosubstrate bound variants [22]. This could explain the needfor a ligand rearrangement in WelO5.BesD from Streptomyces cattleya, is the most recent Fe(II)/a-KG halogenase to be structurally characterised. This\u2018cryptic\u2019 halogenase catalyses conversion of free lysine to4-Cl-lysine, an intermediate in the biogenesis of propar-gyl amino acids [22]. Notably these radical halogenasescome from the same bacterium as 50-FDAS [24]. Thesolved 1.95 A\u030astructure (PDB: 6NIE) revealed four BesDmonomers in the ASU, the classic b sandwich, and anactive site around iron are consistent with other Fe(II)/a-KGs [25NoneNone]. The most striking difference is the bindingsite of the lysine substrate: a small polar pocket containingmultiple hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate of lysine(H134, W238, R74) and to the amine (E120, N219,T221, D140) (Figure 2c). This corresponds to substrateutilisation: free and polar lysine rather than a proteinbound amino acid or the large hydrophobic hapalindole.The positioning of substrate within BesD was againshown critical for activity; a mutation of H134A removesa H-bond between H134 and the lysine carbonyl, result-ing in markedly more hydroxylation that halogenation[25NoneNone]. In a structure similar to WelO5 a helix lid, aCartoon representation of BesD (6NIE) and magnification of the active site. are coloured in white. Active site components are depicted as spheres (chloorange. Oxygen, nitrogen, chloride and iron atoms are coloured light red, dwww.sciencedirect.com tryptophan residue (W239) sits on the top of the boundlysine forming hydrophobic interactions and closing offthe active site. However, the distinct a helix lid is itselfabsent. Second sphere interactions are also at play-N219is postulated to control positioning of Fe(IV) = O (analo-gous to WelO5\u2019s S189) with N219A leading to decreasedhalogenation and increased hydroxylation activity [25NoneNone].Ligand rearrangement allows for formation of Fe(IV) = Oat this desired position, and is thought to proceed bybinding of O2followed by a-KG decarboxylation.Electrophilic halogenationHaloperoxidases Haloperoxidases (HPOs) are often considered as two mainclasses, in accordance with the prosthetic groups utilised inthe active site: haem iron haloperoxidases (such as CPO),and vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (V-HPOs). Themechanism of halogenation employed by these enzymes issimilar; both (generally) are considered to produce freehypohalous acid, HOX, which reacts with the substrate.Inthecase ofthehaem-dependenthaloperoxidases, resting state haem (Figure 3a. I) reacts with H2O2, (Figure 3a. II).And, following loss of hydroxide, a FeIV-porphyrin com-pound (Figure 3a. III) is generated to oxidise the halide.(Figure 3a. IV) For the V-HPOs, a peroxovanadate species(Figure 3a. VII) enables halide oxidation (Figure 3a.V\u2013VIII). Until the early 2000s these enzymes were consid-ered to lack regioselective control, as they generate freeHOX. Intriguingly, a small series of bacterial haloperox-idases are reported to display regiochemical control[26NoneNone,27,28], thoughtherational for thiscontrolwithinthese outlying examples remains unclear [28].The overall 1.90 A\u030astructure of CPO (PDB: 1CPO), ishighly helical, with the haem cofactor nestled betweena proximal a helix and distal a helix, and a singlemonomer in the ASU. This \u2018distal\u2019 side of the haemcofactor is accessible from the surface of the protein bya \u2018narrow\u2019 channel and a \u2018wide\u2019 channel [29NoneNone]. Theproximal helix contains a cysteine (C29) that acts as anaxial ligand to the iron centre, and the distal containingresides for catalytic peroxide activation (E183, H105,and D106). Whilst a cysteine axial to the haem is oftenseen in cytochrome P450s, CPO is one of the few haemiron haloperoxidases, characterised so far, that has thisfeature. The glutamic acid residue (E183) acts as anacid-base catalyst, deprotonating a free peroxide mole-cule. H105 and D106 are proposed to assist with thisdeprotonation step [30].Haem-dependent haloperoxidases have also been discov-ered in multiple mammalian groups; thyroid peroxidasea-helices are coloured in red, b-strands are coloured in blue and loopsride) and sticks. a-KG carbons are coloured in turquoise and lysine inark blue, green and brown, respectively.Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2020, 56 Catalysis and regulationFigure 3(a) (b) (c) Current Opinion in Structural BiologyMechanism and structure of haem-and vanadium dependent-haloperoxidases.

This enzymecatalyses iodination of tyrosine residues on thyroglobulinenabling production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine.The crystal structure of TPO is yet to be solved, howeverstructures of human peroxidases able to utilise hypoha-lous acid, showing moderate sequence similarity to TPO,such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoperoxidase(LPO) have been studied extensively. Both MPO [32](PDB: 3F9P) and LPO (PDB: 2R5L) [33] have structuresdominated by 20 a-helices (19 in MPO) [34] and havehaems accessible through a wide channel from the sur-face, as with CPO. The proteins, unlike CPO, are cova-lently linked, through esters, to their haem cofactor (E242and D94 in MPO and E258 and D108 in LPO). Ratherthan a catalytic glutamic acid residue involved in peroxidedeprotonation, these mammalian enzymes contain a cat-alytic histidine in the distal site, more reminiscent ofhaem peroxidases [35]. Both MPO and LPO have aconserved histidine as the axial ligand, again distinct fromCPO\u2019s axial cysteine, and similar to the active site struc-ture of classified peroxidases.The core structure of Curvularia inaequalis V-CPO, 2.1 A\u030awith one monomer per ASU, (PDB: 1VNC) [36NoneNone] consistsmainly of tight a-helices, with two four-helix bundles asthe main structural feature. This general structure isshared with vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases(V-BPO) [37,38] and iodoperoxidases (V-IPO) [39]. Thishighly compact a helical structure is thought to be, inpart, responsible for these enzymes\u2019 stability. It has alsobeen postulated that the stabilising nature of vanadateand calcium ions play a key role [36NoneNone,40]. The reactivesite of these enzymes is shown to lie at the bottom of along, narrow channel in the core of the four-helix bundlewith the vanadium bound as V(V)O3via a histidineresidue (H496 in V-CPO). This histidine is essentialfor vanadate cofactor positioning, (H496A mutation leadsto a complete loss of halogenation activity) [36NoneNone] and assuch is conserved across V-HPOs. A catalytic histidineH404 residue is also conserved above the vanadate and,much like haem haloperoxidases, acts as an acid-basecatalyst for deprotonation of incoming peroxide. Thethree oxygen atoms are located in the equatorial planeand the anionic V(V)O3group is stabilised by the sur-rounding hydrogen-bonding network of amino acids, thisactive site binding remains almost identical in all V-HPOs(Figure 3c).Flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs)FDHs are generally subdivided into two groups: thoseacting on free substrates (variant a) and those acting onsubstrates tethered to a carrier protein, via a flexiblephosphopantatheine linkage (variant b). Both contain asite. a-helices are coloured in red, b-strands are coloured in blue and loopsspheres (vanadium) and sticks. Carbon atoms corresponding to protein arevanadium atoms are coloured light red, dark blue and grey, respectively.www.sciencedirect.com flavin-binding domain, akin to flavin-dependent oxyge-nases. The most well characterised FDHs act on trypto-phan and often display a \u2018box\u2019 architecture of the flavinbinding domain, and \u2018pyramid\u2019 architecture of the sub-strate binding domain [7]. FADH2is generated fromFAD (Figure 4a. IV) by a concomitant flavin reductase[7]. Once generated, FADH2(Figure 4a. I) undergoesreaction with molecular oxygen forming flavin-C(4a)-hydroperoxide (Figure 4a. II) (in analogy to the mono-oxygenases). A halide anion then reacts with FADH2forming the corresponding hypohalous acid (HOX).The flavin binding site and the substrate binding siteare separated by a 10 A\u030atunnel; hypohalous acid migratesdown this tunnel to the substrate binding site, where acatalytic lysine residue is believed to form a haloaminespecies (Figure 4a. V) governing regioselectivity [7].Regioselectivity in FDHs is governed by both electro-phile and substrate positioning. PyrH is a tryptophan-5-halogenase, whilst ThaI and BorH are tryptophan-6-halo-genases [41\u201343]. Analysis of the X-ray crystal structures ofthese three enzymes reveals that PyrH has a distinctlydifferent tryptophan binding site, to that within the othertwo enzymes. As a result of altered indole positioning, inPyrH C-5 of indole is placed proximal to the catalyticlysine residue, postulated to direct the halogenatingspecies. This results in the observed regioselectivity ofhalogenation [41\u201343]. Recent molecular dynamics simu-lations on PrnA and PyrH, carried out by Karabencheva-Christova and team [44], further corroborated theimposed binding orientation of tryptophan dictatingregio-specificity. Recently, the tryptophan FDH related halogenase BvrHwas identified by meta-genome mining, it not only has amore accessible and open substrate binding site, but alsoaccepts indole instead of tryptophan. The halide bindingsite for BvrH is identical to that observed in RebH [45].However, the halogen preference by BvrH was for bro-mide over chloride (fluoride and iodide were not tested).FDHs which accept tethered substrates, in contrast tofree substrates, display a different substrate bindingdomain. This has been shown for PltA (PDB: 5DBJ)[46,47]. The dimeric PltA has a smaller C-terminalsubstrate domain compared to RebH, PrnA and PyrH,but the putative substrate binding site is sealed, indi-cating a requirement for domain re-arrangement fortethered substrate (pyrrolyl-S-PltL) to bind for dichlor-ination. It was speculated that this closed off structurewould limit off-target chlorination of small molecules[47]. PltA is the first FDH revealing a second halide are coloured in white.

It could perhaps be a crystallisation artefact, orperhaps function as a reservoir locally increasing chlo-ride concentration [47].Another recently discovered phenolic FDH with peculiarsubstrate scope and substrate binding domain is PltM(PDB: 6BZN) [48None]. This FDH mono-halogenates and di-halogenates phenolic compounds (such as phloroglucinol)using chloride, bromide and iodide as substrates, with apreference for chloride and bromide over iodide. PltMcrystal structures not only highlighted multiple FADbinding modes, shedding light on the conformationalcontrol of FADH2binding and FAD release, crucial forFAD recycling, but also revealed a small novel helicalsubstrate binding domain [48None].Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2020, 65:51\u201360 A flavin-dependent halogenase from a Marine virusFollowing a bioinformatics led approach that revealed apreviously unnoticed motif Fx.PNone.Sx.G with which toidentify halogenases, in silico, discriminating them frommonooxygenases, the first halogenase from a virus and thefirst FDH with a preference for iodination VirX1 wasfound [10NoneNone,49]. This FDH was found in the genome ofthe marine cyanophage Syn10. Not only is the viral originof VirX1 puzzling, but its wide substrate scope andpreference for iodination over bromination raises ques-tions on its native function. Its broad substrate flexibilityand ability to generate aryl iodides makes it an attractivebiotechnological tool. Structural elucidation of thisenzyme revealed a trimeric quaternary structure includ-ing the commonly found flavin binding domain and asubstrate binding domain reminiscent of PrnA. TheVirX1 crystal structure (PDB: 6QGM) (Figure 4b) andwww.sciencedirect.com Haogenases: structures and functions Ludewig et al. 59in silico studies reveal the substrate binding site in VirX1to be much more accessible than in other FDHs that acton free substrates (such as PrnA, RebH and BvrH),providing explanation of the diverse and unusual sub-strate scope of this FDH. The halide binding site ofVirX1 shows a similar architecture to the halide bindingsite of PrnA. VirX1\u2019s considerably larger and more acces-sible active site is likely to be the reason for its observedbroad substrate specificity and ability to use the largest,but electronically most readily oxidised of the halides.Concluding thoughtsAs indicated by compound structural diversity, so far onlya very small proportion of existing halogenases have beenexplored. In silico approaches for the discovery of novelhalogenases enable the identification of wildly differentenzymes. Using such approaches, major advances havebeen seen in recent years including discovery of radicaland FDH halogenases with biotechnologically interestingsubstrate scope.Though the field is progressing rapidly, numerous excit-ing central questions remain to be answered. The postu-lated lysine haloamine, within the FDHs and speculationover its exact role as either the definitive halogenatingspecies or as a reservoir of Cl+remains to be fullyresolved. The regioselective HPOs hold considerablepromise; what are the underpinning mechanisms bywhich they mediate their control? What are the keystructural features of substrate free radical halogenases,what factors influence stability? Currently there is toolittle structural data to robustly address these questions,this is likely to change over the next few years. It is anexciting time for enzymatic halogenation.Conflict of interest statementNothing declared.Acknowledgements We thank ERC GenoChemetics (FP7/2007-2013/ERC consolidator grantGCGXC grant agreement no 614779 RJMG) for funding, CSC and EPSRCCRITICAT EP/L016419/1 for studentship support (KG & SMrespectively).

Addition-ally, incorporation of Cl, Br, or I provides chemicallyreactive and orthogonal handles for selective modificationthrough cross-coupling chemistry [5].

Thisenzyme was named chloroperoxidase (CPO), a haloperox-idase, from the fungus Calariomyces fumago [9]. For severaldecades the haloperoxidases remained the only halo-genases known [9]. However, the turn of the millenniumcorresponded to a significant acceleration in this researchfield, largely fuelled by investigations into the biogenesis ofnatural products from bacteria, fungi and plants.

Though fluorine isthemost abundant halogenin the earth\u2019s crust, andthe 13thmost abundant element, few natural organofluorine com-pounds exist.

The N-terminal domainconsists of a central \u00df-sheet sitting in between seven a-heli-ces and an extensive loop connecting the last two \u00df-strands(see Figure 1b). The C-terminal domain is comprised of twoanti-parallel \u00df-sheets sandwiched by three short helices(Figure 1b). Within the trimer found in the asymmetric unit(ASU) of the crystal structure, intermolecular domain inter-facesareformedbetweenN-terminaldomainsofneighbour-ing monomers (relying on the aforementioned extendedloop (98\u2013114)) as well as contacts between N-terminaldomains and C-terminal domains of neighbouring mono-mers. A dimer of trimers may be seen within the crystalstructure, consistent with the hexameric solution state sug-gested by analytical size exclusion chromatography [15].Each of the three N-terminal to C-terminal domain inter-faces harbour SAM, fully encapsulating the substrate (seeFigure 1b). The ribose ring may be seen to adopt an unusual,high energy, eclipsed conformation (Figure 1c).

Further detailed mechanistic studies demonstratesubstrate inhibition by SAM, and requirement for fluoridebinding to 50-FDAS in advance of SAM, in order togenerate a productive complex [19]. Dehydration is pro-posed to reach completion upon binding of SAM. Thisresults in a more nucleophilic fluoride, potentially stabi-lised by T80 or the positively charged sulphur atom fromSAM, optimally orientated for the SN2 reaction, as sug-gested by the in silico studies of Vincent et al.",

Crystal struc-tures of SalL show an enlarged halide binding pocketin which a glycine is in place of the serine (S158) of50-FDAS: absence of this serine results in the reducedability to dehydrate the nucleophile and the inability toprocess fluoride (PDB: 2Q6I).

AllFe(II)/a-KG halogenation proceeds by the same generalmechanism. The enzyme resting state (Figure 2a.

Dioxygen addition to theiron centre (Figure 2a.

This helix is postulated toinfluence substrate acceptance (this helix differs most insequence between the more promiscuous AmbO5, andmore substrate-specific WelO5*) [23None]. Substrate bindingalso causes conformational change causing F169 to blockthe large site expected for substrate. Instead F169 sits overH164 in a hydrophobic pocket closed by this external helix.The loop (residues 75\u201382) moves in to form a H-bond fromA82 nitrogen toNC carbon ofthe substrate,whilstana helixmethionine (M225) binds the substrate\u2019s NH (Figure 2b).These interactions position the free substrate over H164,such that the iron centre is 4.5 A\u030afrom the carbon to bechlorinated, but a considerable distance away from thebound chloride (5.7 A\u030a). Subsequent rearrangement ofligands around iron in the solved WelO5 structure, medi-ated by O2binding, is postulated to position the oxo ligandsuch that chlorination is preferred to hydroxylation [12].The NO bound structure (PDB: 5IQV) shows this ligandorientation. Outer sphere effects may also lead to specifichalogenation activity: S189 is theorised to form interactionswith the Fe(IV) = O oxygen, and a mutation to alanine hasbeen shown to reduce halogenation selectivity, possibly as aconsequence of altered ligand positioning. Interestingly adifferent orientation of a-KG is observed in free substrateradical halogenases, in which the C3\u2013C4 bond points out ofthe plane of the a-KG, chloride ion, and histidine, tosubstrate bound variants [22].

        "decarboxylation.Electrophilic halogenationHaloperoxidases Haloperoxidases (HPOs) are often considered as two mainclasses, in accordance with the prosthetic groups utilised inthe active site: haem iron haloperoxidases (such as CPO),and vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (V-HPOs). Themechanism of halogenation employed by these enzymes issimilar; both (generally) are considered to produce freehypohalous acid, HOX, which reacts with the substrate.Inthecase ofthehaem-dependenthaloperoxidases, resting state haem (Figure 3a. I) reacts with H2O2, (Figure 3a. II).And, following loss of hydroxide, a FeIV-porphyrin com-pound (Figure 3a. III) is generated to oxidise the halide.(Figure 3a. IV) For the V-HPOs, a peroxovanadate species(Figure 3a. VII) enables halide oxidation (Figure 3a.V\u2013VIII). Until the early 2000s these enzymes were consid-ered to lack regioselective control, as they generate freeHOX. Intriguingly, a small series of bacterial haloperox-idases are reported to display regiochemical control[26NoneNone,27,28], thoughtherational for thiscontrolwithinthese outlying examples remains unclear",
        "[28].The overall 1.90 A\u030astructure of CPO (PDB: 1CPO), ishighly helical, with the haem cofactor nestled betweena proximal a helix and distal a helix, and a singlemonomer in the ASU. This \u2018distal\u2019 side of the haemcofactor is accessible from the surface of the protein bya \u2018narrow\u2019 channel and a \u2018wide\u2019 channel [29NoneNone]. Theproximal helix contains a cysteine (C29) that acts as anaxial ligand to the iron centre, and the distal containingresides for catalytic peroxide activation (E183, H105,and D106). Whilst a cysteine axial to the haem is oftenseen in cytochrome P450s, CPO is one of the few haemiron haloperoxidases, characterised so far, that has thisfeature. The glutamic acid residue (E183) acts as anacid-base catalyst, deprotonating a free peroxide mole-cule. H105 and D106 are proposed to assist with thisdeprotonation step",

This enzymecatalyses iodination of tyrosine residues on thyroglobulinenabling production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine.The crystal structure of TPO is yet to be solved, howeverstructures of human peroxidases able to utilise hypoha-lous acid, showing moderate sequence similarity to TPO,such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoperoxidase(LPO) have been studied extensively. Both MPO [32](PDB: 3F9P) and LPO (PDB: 2R5L) [33] have structuresdominated by 20 a-helices (19 in MPO) [34] and havehaems accessible through a wide channel from the sur-face, as with CPO. The proteins, unlike CPO, are cova-lently linked, through esters, to their haem cofactor (E242and D94 in MPO and E258 and D108 in LPO). Ratherthan a catalytic glutamic acid residue involved in peroxidedeprotonation, these mammalian enzymes contain a cat-alytic histidine in the distal site, more reminiscent ofhaem peroxidases [35]. Both MPO and LPO have aconserved histidine as the axial ligand, again distinct fromCPO\u2019s axial cysteine, and similar to the active site struc-ture of classified peroxidases.The core structure of Curvularia inaequalis V-CPO, 2.1 A\u030awith one monomer per ASU, (PDB: 1VNC) [36NoneNone] consistsmainly of tight a-helices, with two four-helix bundles asthe main structural feature. This general structure isshared with vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases(V-BPO) [37,38] and iodoperoxidases (V-IPO) [39]. Thishighly compact a helical structure is thought to be, inpart, responsible for these enzymes\u2019 stability. It has alsobeen postulated that the stabilising nature of vanadateand calcium ions play a key role [36NoneNone,40]. The reactivesite of these enzymes is shown to lie at the bottom of along, narrow channel in the core of the four-helix bundlewith the vanadium bound as V(V)O3via a histidineresidue (H496 in V-CPO). This histidine is essentialfor vanadate cofactor positioning, (H496A mutation leadsto a complete loss of halogenation activity) [36NoneNone] and assuch is conserved across V-HPOs. A catalytic histidineH404 residue is also conserved above the vanadate and,much like haem haloperoxidases, acts as an acid-basecatalyst for deprotonation of incoming peroxide. Thethree oxygen atoms are located in the equatorial planeand the anionic V(V)O3group is stabilised by the sur-rounding hydrogen-bonding network of amino acids, thisactive site binding remains almost identical in all V-HPOs(Figure",

The most well characterised FDHs act on trypto-phan and often display a \u2018box\u2019 architecture of the flavinbinding domain, and \u2018pyramid\u2019 architecture of the sub-strate binding domain [7]. FADH2is generated fromFAD (Figure 4a. IV) by a concomitant flavin reductase[7]. Once generated, FADH2(Figure 4a. I) undergoesreaction with molecular oxygen forming flavin-C(4a)-hydroperoxide (Figure 4a. II) (in analogy to the mono-oxygenases). A halide anion then reacts with FADH2forming the corresponding hypohalous acid (HOX).The flavin binding site and the substrate binding siteare separated by a 10 A\u030atunnel; hypohalous acid migratesdown this tunnel to the substrate binding site, where acatalytic lysine residue is believed to form a haloaminespecies (Figure 4a. V) governing regioselectivity",
        "[7].Regioselectivity in FDHs is governed by both electro-phile and substrate positioning. PyrH is a tryptophan-5-halogenase, whilst ThaI and BorH are tryptophan-6-halo-genases [41\u201343]. Analysis of the X-ray crystal structures ofthese three enzymes reveals that PyrH has a distinctlydifferent tryptophan binding site, to that within the othertwo enzymes. As a result of altered indole positioning, inPyrH C-5 of indole is placed proximal to the catalyticlysine residue, postulated to direct the halogenatingspecies. This results in the observed regioselectivity ofhalogenation [41\u201343]. Recent molecular dynamics simu-lations on PrnA and PyrH, carried out by Karabencheva-Christova and team [44], further corroborated theimposed binding orientation of tryptophan dictatingregio-specificity.",
