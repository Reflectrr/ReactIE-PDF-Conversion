Around 20% ofsmall molecule drugs and over 80% of marketed agro-chemicals are halogenated, including leading compoundssuch as sitagliptin and aripiprazole with annual salesrevenues of $3.6 and $7.9 billion respectively [3,4]. Thesestatistics are perhaps not surprising as incorporation of ahalogen can significantly impact a molecule\u2019s bioactivityand bioavailability. Furthermore, the incorporation of a Clor Br can provide a chemically reactive and orthogonalhandle for selective modification through cross-couplingchemistry [5]. Synthetic halogenation ordinarily utilizesharsh conditions, noxious reagents, generates harmful by-products and often lacks regioselectivity [6\u20138]. The fine-chemical, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industrieshave an increasing interest in utilizing bio-catalysts inprocess, as a route to more selective, greener, and cost-effective synthesis, and it is imperative that new enzymesare discovered and developed for process. In contrast tosynthetic chemical alternatives, halogenating enzymesafford the highly regiospecific incorporation of a halogeninto an organic molecule. The mild reaction conditions(physiological pH and temperature), aqueous solventsand the biodegradable catalyst, also provide environmen-tal and operational benefits.www.sciencedirect.com Over 5000 halogenated natural products have now beenreported, these are predominantly chlorinated and bro-minated metabolites, with only about 100 iodinated and5 fluorinated metabolites having been isolated (for exam-ples of the breadth of structural diversity, see Figure 1)[9\u201312]. For many years the only known halogenases werethe haloperoxidases, however over the past 20 years,investigation of the biosynthetic pathways mediatingthe construction of diverse series of halometabolites,predominantly from actinomycetes, has revealed adiverse series of halogenases. The halogenases discov-ered can be broadly classified as employing electrophilic,nucleophilic or radical halogenation mechanisms (Fig-ure 2). Electrophilic processes dominate for the installa-tion of C\u2013I, C\u2013Br and C\u2013Cl bonds, however due to thefluorine\u2019s high electronegativity, the biogenesis of C\u2013Fbonds is likely to only occur via nucleophilic processes.Electrophilic halogenationHaloperoxidases (haem iron and vanadium dependent)The earliest known enzymes involved in halogenationwere the haloperoxidases with chloroperoxidase (CPO)from the fungus Caldariomyces fumago being discovered in1958 [26]. For the next 35 years haloperoxidases were theonly known halogenating enzymes.The haloperoxidases may be divided into two majorclasses, the haem iron peroxidases and the vanadiumdependent halogenases. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is aparticularly notable example of a haem iron peroxidase,this membrane associated enzyme is responsible for theiodination event in the biosynthesis of thyroxine [27].Haloperoxidases are believed to produce free hypohalousacids (HOI, HOBr and HOCl) According to the mostelectronegative halogen they can oxidize, they can besub-classified as iodo-, bromo-or chloroperoxidases.Hypohalous acid generation occurs by the reaction ofhydrogen peroxide with the ferric or vanadate restingstate of the peroxidase, followed by halide addition,forming the ferric or vanadate hypohalite. Finally, thehighly reactive hypohalous acid is released (see Scheme1b,c), as it is not bound and directed by the enzyme, it isthought to diffuse freely. It reacts in an electrophilicfashion with electron rich compounds [28,29]. As a result,the haloperoxidases tend to show a very low level ofregiospecificity, and oftentimes a suite of mono, di andtri-halogenated products are generated, depending uponthe reactivity of the substrate. Nevertheless, a smallgroup of highly regio-and stereo-specific vanadiumdependent halogenases exist, such as vanadium-Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2018, 120 Biocatalysis and biotransformationFigure 1H N N H N H O OO O O O HN NH O H H O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O OH OH O N N NN HO HO NC HO HO HO HO OH H H HO O S S SS S radicicol 6welwitindolinone 5calicheamicin 1pyrrolnitrin 3nucleocidin 2bromophenol 4NO2 NH2 NH2 Cl F Cl Cl Br Br l Cl Current Opinion in Chemical BiologyA glimpse of the structural and biological diversity shown by halogenated compounds: the enediyne antitumour antibiotic calicheamicin 1 [13,14],nucleosidin 2, one of only 5 naturally occurring fluorinated metabolites to be isolated to date [11,12], the antifungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin 3 involvingtwo flavin dependent halogenases in its assembly [15,16None,17NoneNone]. One of a series of marine bromophenols 4, generated by flavin dependenthalogenases [21NoneNone,22], as well as the cyanobacterial metabolite welwitindolinone 5, chlorinated by the first non-haem iron halogenase shown toaccept a non phosphopantetheine tethered substrate [23NoneNone,24None], the fungal natural product radicicol 6 chlorinated by a broad substrate specificityflavin dependent halogenase [25None].dependent NapHI involved in alkene chlorination withinthe napyradiomycin pathway, indicating that it is possiblefor such systems to evolve to bind their substrates in ahighly specific manner [30NoneNone,31]. Many haloperoxidasesnoted within the literature may have a primary function asperoxidases, and this non-native function could result inthe ready release of the hypohalous acid from the enzy-me\u2019s active site. At a structural level, one significantdifference between peroxidases and haloperoxidases isthat the distal metal coordination site is typically occu-pied by a histidine residue in peroxidases, but by acysteine in haloperoxidases [32].Flavin dependent halogenases (FDHs)Haloperoxidases remained the only known biocatalystsenabling C\u2013X bond formation until 1995, when Dairiet al. identified the first flavin dependent halogenase,chl. This was determined through gene inactivation stud-ies within the biosynthetic cluster encoding 7-chlorote-tracycline formation [33]. Soon after this discovery, twofurther new halogenase genes, prnA and prnC from pyr-rolnitrin (3) biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens wereidentified by Hammer et al. [16None]. There is debate as tothe exact way in which FDHs function and details onwhich residues within the active site participate may varyfrom one enzyme to another [34\u201336].Flavin dependent halogenases, in contrast to the vana-dium and haem haloperoxidases, are highly substratespecific and regioselective catalysts. The majority of thisCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology 2018, 43:119\u2013126 class of halogenases utilize free reduced flavin (FADH2),however in other enzymes the flavin is covalently boundto the enzyme, as in the case for CmlS from the chlor-amphenicol biosynthetic pathway [37]. Within naturalsystems FADH2is generated from FAD by a halogen-ase-specific flavin reductase, though notably in reconsti-tuted systems, there is no requirement for a specific flavinreductase to be utilized. The FADH2is then used togenerate hypohalous acid (Scheme 1a). In flavin depen-dent halogenases the flavin binding site, where the HOXis generated, and the substrate binding site, where halo-genation occurs, are separated by a 10 A\u030atunnel. Thesubstrate can be free as in the case of variant A FDHssuch as PyrH, PrnA or Rdc2 [17NoneNone,18NoneNone,19,38,39None] or boundto a carrier protein, as occurs in the case of variant BFDHs such as PltA and Bmp2 [20NoneNone,21NoneNone,22,40]. In thelast decade a large number of genes with sequencesimilarity to known FDHs have been detected, but onlya very small fraction of these have been confirmed ashaving in vitro halogenase activity [41]. One of the reasonsfor this is that these enzymes have a very narrow substratespecificity, and therefore the endogenous substrate mustbe known, accessed, and presented in its appropriate freeor bound form as required by the enzyme in order toconfirm the halogenase activity.Flavoenzyme Bmp5, a phenol brominaseAn electrophilic halogenase with a subtly different mech-anism has been recently identified, implicated in thegeneration of series of toxic polybrominated diphenylwww.sciencedirect.com Halogenases: powerful tools for biocatalysis Gkotsi et al. 121Figure 2Haloperoxidases (a) (b) (c) (d) CPO PrnA PrnA PltAflA SyrB2 WelO5 WelO5 flA CPO NapH1 Flavin-Dependent HalogenasesNucleophilic HalogenasesActive siteRadical Halogenases9.02 Active siteCurrent Opinion in Chemical BiologyX-ray crystal structures of halogenases and their corresponding active sites.

The non-heme-irona-ketoglutarate(KG)-dependent enzymes are the onlyknown enzymes that have been found so far to catalyzehalogenation reactions with radical intermediateswww.sciencedirect.com Halogenases: powerful tools for biocatalysis Gkotsi et al. 123(Scheme 1e). This class can selectively insert a halogeninto a non-activated, aliphatic C\u2013H bond, a transforma-tion which is energetically challenging [43NoneNone,44,45None,46NoneNone].However, these halogenases are very difficult to handle invitro, due to their oxygen sensitivity and their require-ment for substrate carrier proteins. Recently Hillwig andLiu identified a new member of this family of halogenases(WelO5) from welwitindolinone (5) biosynthesis that canregio-and stereo-selectively chlorinate the unactivatedcarbon centre of 12-epi-fischerindole, without the needfor the substrate to be protein bound [23NoneNone,24None,43NoneNone,44,45None,46NoneNone,47\u201349]. This is a breakthrough in the fieldof biohalogenation.Nucleophilic halogenasesSo far two families of nucleophilic halogenases are known.Both families, the halide methyltransferases and SAMhalogenases utilize S-adenosylmethione (SAM) as a co-factor or as a co-substrate [11,12,50NoneNone,51NoneNone,52]. Suchenzymes provide the only biogenesis of fluorinated natu-ral products, (including fluoroacetate and fluorothreo-nine) by the impressive feat of generating fluoride anionsin the absence of its hydration sheath. Other chlorinatedcompounds including salinosporamide are also generatedby nucleophilic halogenases [53].Applications of halogenasesThe future for the industrial utilization of enzymatichalogenation shows much promise. The developmentand utilization of fluorinase in18F labelling of [18F]-5-fluororibose for use in Positron Emission Tomography(PET) imaging is exciting, enabling quick and simpletwo-step synthesis of the radioisotope. Incredibly, thefluorinase has also shown the ability to process tetheredsubstrates [54None,55,56].The applicability of halogenases to synthesis has previ-ously been limited by low levels of enzyme productionand stability as well as the lack of sufficiently substrate-diverse halogenases. Recent progress towards addressingthese defects has been manifold, for example the Lewisgroup have demonstrated that the simple co-expression ofRebH with the chaperones GroEL and GroES can lead toup to 105 mg LNone1of protein [57]. Utilization of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) by treating crude E.coli lysates with glutaraldehyde has been demonstrated bySewald and Frese to successfully stabilize the halogenaseRebH, this approach has also been successfully adoptedand applied by Micklefield [59NoneNone,60None]. In a complemen-tary manner to address stability, Sewald has also exploredthe utilization of an engineered thermostable halogenasemutant [61None,62]. In order to enable the directed evolutionof the tryptophan 6-halogenase ThaI from Streptomycesalbogriseolus Sewald used a high-throughput screen utiliz-ing cross-coupling conditions that the Goss group haddeveloped and demonstrated to introduce a shift in thefluorescence of tryptophan [63None]. In parallel the Lewiswww.sciencedirect.com group have developed a clever \u201ccombinatorial codonmutagenesis\u201d approach and applied this to the flavindependent tryptophan halogenase RebH extending itssubstrate specificity [64NoneNone,65]. The discovery of newenzymes with broader substrate specificity, notably RadHfrom the fungus Chaetomium chiversii and KermI from themetagenomic library of a marine organism, will offerfurther opportunities to accelerate this field [66,67None].The building of new biosynthetic pathways into whichhalogenation is engineered is an exciting and growingarea. Using such a strategy Eusta\u0301quio et al. have demon-strated the inter-conversion of the clorobiosin and novo-biocin antibiotic pathways, and Salas has elegantly dem-onstrated the combinatorial use of halogenases togenerate analogues of staurosporin and rebeccamycin,metabolites with chemotherapeutic properties [68None,69None].The engineering of a new fluorinated polyketide fluoro-salinosporamide, as well as fluoromalonyl-coA has alsobeen achieved [70,71NoneNone].The utilization of the powerful combination of halogena-tion and cross-coupling to effect C\u2013H activation, firstdemonstrated by the GenoChemetic generation of deri-vatives of pacidamycin, is an emerging and exciting area[72NoneNone]. O\u2019Connor was able to harness the bacterial halo-genase RebH and engineer the production of chlorinatedalkaloids within the plant system, Catheranthus roseus andalso effect selective derivatization of the resultant aryl-halide [73NoneNone,74,75]. Moving away from natural products,Lewis has demonstrated late stage diversification of bio-logically active small molecules using a two-step enzy-matic bromination and Pd mediated cross-coupling [76].More recently Micklefield has shown that both haloge-nation and cross-coupling of indole may be carried out inone pot with the halogenase stabilized as CLEAS andseparated from the palladium catalyst by a permeablemembrane [60None]. By developing very careful reactionconditions, even halotryptophans (which can chelate toand poison palladium), may be cross coupled at roomtemperature and in the presence of oxygen. This findinghas enabled the Goss group to utilize the GenoChemeticapproach to natural product generation in a living system,with cells engineered to produce brominated metabolitesand their synchronous cross-coupling in situ [77NoneNone]. Thisapproach affords the benefit of easing compound purifi-cation and drawing metabolic flux through the system.Concluding thoughtsThe past decade has brought many exciting advances inbiocatalytic halogenation. There is considerable promisefor application of halogenases in large scale synthesis,reducing the need for toxic reagents, overcoming issues ofregioselectivity, and reducing toxic waste; however, sev-eral limitations remain: the substrate scope for halo-genases is still narrow and current examples have beenperformed under very dilute conditions. ImmobilizationCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology 2018, 124 Biocatalysis and biotransformationand stabilization using CLEAs and the exploration of co-factor regeneration systems have laid the foundationrequired for efficient and scalable biocatalytic halogena-tion. In the context of the Pharma and Agrochemicalsectors, many of the desired substrates have low solubilityin aqueous media. In order to accommodate such sub-strates, halogenases will have to be evolved that cantolerate added organic solvents, or perhaps exploredwithin a system that confers enhanced solvent tolerancesuch as within a catalytic biofilm. The promise of selec-tive halogenation under mild conditions with renewablecatalysts is a very attractive prospect and is ripe forexploitation and application.Acknowledgements We thank Syngenta for a CASE studentship (DSG), Astra Zeneca andEPSRC CRITICAT EP/L016419/1 for studentship support (JD), ERAIB(Grant no. 031A338A RJMG) and ERC GenoChemetics (FP7/2007-2013/ERC consolidator grant GCGXC grant agreement no 614779 RJMG) forfunding.

        "Ltd.Introduction The incorporation of a halogen into a molecule can have astriking impact on its properties [1,2]. Around 20% ofsmall molecule drugs and over 80% of marketed agro-chemicals are halogenated, including leading compoundssuch as sitagliptin and aripiprazole with annual salesrevenues of $3.6 and $7.9 billion respectively [3,4]. Thesestatistics are perhaps not surprising as incorporation of ahalogen can significantly impact a molecule\u2019s bioactivityand bioavailability. Furthermore, the incorporation of a Clor Br can provide a chemically reactive and orthogonalhandle for selective modification through cross-couplingchemistry [5]. Synthetic halogenation ordinarily utilizesharsh conditions, noxious reagents, generates harmful by-products and often lacks regioselectivity [6\u20138]. The fine-chemical, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industrieshave an increasing interest in utilizing bio-catalysts inprocess, as a route to more selective, greener, and cost-effective synthesis, and it is imperative that new enzymesare discovered and developed for process. In contrast tosynthetic chemical alternatives, halogenating enzymesafford the highly regiospecific incorporation of a halogeninto an organic molecule. The mild reaction conditions(physiological pH and temperature), aqueous solventsand the biodegradable catalyst, also provide environmen-tal and operational",
        "benefits.www.sciencedirect.com Over 5000 halogenated natural products have now beenreported, these are predominantly chlorinated and bro-minated metabolites, with only about 100 iodinated and5 fluorinated metabolites having been isolated (for exam-ples of the breadth of structural diversity, see Figure 1)[9\u201312]. For many years the only known halogenases werethe haloperoxidases, however over the past 20 years,investigation of the biosynthetic pathways mediatingthe construction of diverse series of halometabolites,predominantly from actinomycetes, has revealed adiverse series of halogenases. The halogenases discov-ered can be broadly classified as employing electrophilic,nucleophilic or radical halogenation mechanisms (Fig-ure 2). Electrophilic processes dominate for the installa-tion of C\u2013I, C\u2013Br and C\u2013Cl bonds, however due to thefluorine\u2019s high electronegativity, the biogenesis of C\u2013Fbonds is likely to only occur via nucleophilic",
        "processes.Electrophilic halogenationHaloperoxidases (haem iron and vanadium dependent)The earliest known enzymes involved in halogenationwere the haloperoxidases with chloroperoxidase (CPO)from the fungus Caldariomyces fumago being discovered in1958 [26]. For the next 35 years haloperoxidases were theonly known halogenating",
        "enzymes.The haloperoxidases may be divided into two majorclasses, the haem iron peroxidases and the vanadiumdependent halogenases. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is aparticularly notable example of a haem iron peroxidase,this membrane associated enzyme is responsible for theiodination event in the biosynthesis of thyroxine [27].Haloperoxidases are believed to produce free hypohalousacids (HOI, HOBr and HOCl) According to the mostelectronegative halogen they can oxidize, they can besub-classified as iodo-, bromo-or chloroperoxidases.Hypohalous acid generation occurs by the reaction ofhydrogen peroxide with the ferric or vanadate restingstate of the peroxidase, followed by halide addition,forming the ferric or vanadate hypohalite. Finally, thehighly reactive hypohalous acid is released (see Scheme1b,c), as it is not bound and directed by the enzyme, it isthought to diffuse freely. It reacts in an electrophilicfashion with electron rich compounds [28,29]. As a result,the haloperoxidases tend to show a very low level ofregiospecificity, and oftentimes a suite of mono, di andtri-halogenated products are generated, depending uponthe reactivity of the substrate. Nevertheless, a smallgroup of highly regio-and stereo-specific vanadiumdependent halogenases exist, such as",

Many haloperoxidasesnoted within the literature may have a primary function asperoxidases, and this non-native function could result inthe ready release of the hypohalous acid from the enzy-me\u2019s active site. At a structural level, one significantdifference between peroxidases and haloperoxidases isthat the distal metal coordination site is typically occu-pied by a histidine residue in peroxidases, but by acysteine in haloperoxidases",
        "[32].Flavin dependent halogenases (FDHs)Haloperoxidases remained the only known biocatalystsenabling C\u2013X bond formation until 1995, when Dairiet al. identified the first flavin dependent halogenase,chl. This was determined through gene inactivation stud-ies within the biosynthetic cluster encoding 7-chlorote-tracycline formation [33]. Soon after this discovery, twofurther new halogenase genes, prnA and prnC from pyr-rolnitrin (3) biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens wereidentified by Hammer et al. [16None]. There is debate as tothe exact way in which FDHs function and details onwhich residues within the active site participate may varyfrom one enzyme to another",

        "thisCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology 2018, 43:119\u2013126 class of halogenases utilize free reduced flavin (FADH2),however in other enzymes the flavin is covalently boundto the enzyme, as in the case for CmlS from the chlor-amphenicol biosynthetic pathway [37]. Within naturalsystems FADH2is generated from FAD by a halogen-ase-specific flavin reductase, though notably in reconsti-tuted systems, there is no requirement for a specific flavinreductase to be utilized. The FADH2is then used togenerate hypohalous acid (Scheme 1a). In flavin depen-dent halogenases the flavin binding site, where the HOXis generated, and the substrate binding site, where halo-genation occurs, are separated by a 10 A\u030atunnel. Thesubstrate can be free as in the case of variant A FDHssuch as PyrH, PrnA or Rdc2 [17NoneNone,18NoneNone,19,38,39None] or boundto a carrier protein, as occurs in the case of variant BFDHs such as PltA and Bmp2 [20NoneNone,21NoneNone,22,40]. In thelast decade a large number of genes with sequencesimilarity to known FDHs have been detected, but onlya very small fraction of these have been confirmed ashaving in vitro halogenase activity [41]. One of the reasonsfor this is that these enzymes have a very narrow substratespecificity, and therefore the endogenous substrate mustbe known, accessed, and presented in its appropriate freeor bound form as required by the enzyme in order toconfirm the halogenase",

Recently Hillwig andLiu identified a new member of this family of halogenases(WelO5) from welwitindolinone (5) biosynthesis that canregio-and stereo-selectively chlorinate the unactivatedcarbon centre of 12-epi-fischerindole, without the needfor the substrate to be protein bound [23NoneNone,24None,43NoneNone,44,45None,46NoneNone,47\u201349]. This is a breakthrough in the fieldof",
        "biohalogenation.Nucleophilic halogenasesSo far two families of nucleophilic halogenases are known.Both families, the halide methyltransferases and SAMhalogenases utilize S-adenosylmethione (SAM) as a co-factor or as a co-substrate [11,12,50NoneNone,51NoneNone,52]. Suchenzymes provide the only biogenesis of fluorinated natu-ral products, (including fluoroacetate and fluorothreo-nine) by the impressive feat of generating fluoride anionsin the absence of its hydration sheath. Other chlorinatedcompounds including salinosporamide are also generatedby nucleophilic halogenases",
        "[53].Applications of halogenasesThe future for the industrial utilization of enzymatichalogenation shows much promise. The developmentand utilization of fluorinase in18F labelling of [18F]-5-fluororibose for use in Positron Emission Tomography(PET) imaging is exciting, enabling quick and simpletwo-step synthesis of the radioisotope. Incredibly, thefluorinase has also shown the ability to process tetheredsubstrates",
        "[54None,55,56].The applicability of halogenases to synthesis has previ-ously been limited by low levels of enzyme productionand stability as well as the lack of sufficiently substrate-diverse halogenases. Recent progress towards addressingthese defects has been manifold, for example the Lewisgroup have demonstrated that the simple co-expression ofRebH with the chaperones GroEL and GroES can lead toup to 105 mg LNone1of protein [57]. Utilization of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) by treating crude E.coli lysates with glutaraldehyde has been demonstrated bySewald and Frese to successfully stabilize the halogenaseRebH, this approach has also been successfully adoptedand applied by Micklefield [59NoneNone,60None]. In a complemen-tary manner to address stability, Sewald has also exploredthe utilization of an engineered thermostable halogenasemutant [61None,62]. In order to enable the directed evolutionof the tryptophan 6-halogenase ThaI from Streptomycesalbogriseolus Sewald used a high-throughput screen utiliz-ing cross-coupling conditions that the Goss group haddeveloped and demonstrated to introduce a shift in thefluorescence of tryptophan [63None]. In parallel the",
        "Lewiswww.sciencedirect.com group have developed a clever \u201ccombinatorial codonmutagenesis\u201d approach and applied this to the flavindependent tryptophan halogenase RebH extending itssubstrate specificity [64NoneNone,65]. The discovery of newenzymes with broader substrate specificity, notably RadHfrom the fungus Chaetomium chiversii and KermI from themetagenomic library of a marine organism, will offerfurther opportunities to accelerate this field",
        "[66,67None].The building of new biosynthetic pathways into whichhalogenation is engineered is an exciting and growingarea. Using such a strategy Eusta\u0301quio et al. have demon-strated the inter-conversion of the clorobiosin and novo-biocin antibiotic pathways, and Salas has elegantly dem-onstrated the combinatorial use of halogenases togenerate analogues of staurosporin and rebeccamycin,metabolites with chemotherapeutic properties [68None,69None].The engineering of a new fluorinated polyketide fluoro-salinosporamide, as well as fluoromalonyl-coA has alsobeen achieved",
        "[70,71NoneNone].The utilization of the powerful combination of halogena-tion and cross-coupling to effect C\u2013H activation, firstdemonstrated by the GenoChemetic generation of deri-vatives of pacidamycin, is an emerging and exciting area[72NoneNone]. O\u2019Connor was able to harness the bacterial halo-genase RebH and engineer the production of chlorinatedalkaloids within the plant system, Catheranthus roseus andalso effect selective derivatization of the resultant aryl-halide [73NoneNone,74,75]. Moving away from natural products,Lewis has demonstrated late stage diversification of bio-logically active small molecules using a two-step enzy-matic bromination and Pd mediated cross-coupling [76].More recently Micklefield has shown that both haloge-nation and cross-coupling of indole may be carried out inone pot with the halogenase stabilized as CLEAS andseparated from the palladium catalyst by a permeablemembrane [60None]. By developing very careful reactionconditions, even halotryptophans (which can chelate toand poison palladium), may be cross coupled at roomtemperature and in the presence of oxygen. This findinghas enabled the Goss group to utilize the GenoChemeticapproach to natural product generation in a living system,with cells engineered to produce brominated metabolitesand their synchronous cross-coupling in situ [77NoneNone]. Thisapproach affords the benefit of easing compound purifi-cation and drawing metabolic flux through the",
        "system.Concluding thoughtsThe past decade has brought many exciting advances inbiocatalytic halogenation. There is considerable promisefor application of halogenases in large scale synthesis,reducing the need for toxic reagents, overcoming issues ofregioselectivity, and reducing toxic waste; however, sev-eral limitations remain: the substrate scope for halo-genases is still narrow and current examples have beenperformed under very dilute conditions.",
