CuracinA is such a bioactive compound with potent anti-proliferative activity. During itsbiosynthesis the growing substrate is bound covalently to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) thatis able to access catalytic sites of neighboring domains for chain elongation andmodification. While ACP domains usually occur as monomers, the curacin A cluster codesfor a triplet ACP (ACPI-ACPII-ACPIII) within the CurA PKS module. We have determinedthe structure of the isolated holo ACPI and show that the ACPs are independent of eachother within this tri-domain system. In addition, we have determined the structure of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-loaded holo-ACPI, which is the substrate for the uniquehalogenase (Hal) domain embedded within the CurA module. We have identified theinteraction surface of both proteins using mutagenesis and MALDI-based identification ofproduct formation. Amino acids affecting product formation are located on helices II and IIIof ACPI and form a contiguous surface. Since the CurA Hal accepts substrate only whenpresented by one of the ACPs within the ACPI-ACPII-ACPIII tri-domain, our data provideinsight into the specificity of the chlorination reaction.The polyketide synthases (PKS) and the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) producenatural products of a huge chemical diversity. PKS and NRPS are multidomain proteinassemblies that function by sequentially elongating a growing polyketide or peptide chain byacyl units or amino acids, respectively. The growing product is attached via a thioesterlinkage to the 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine (4\u2032-Ppant) arm of either a holo acyl carrier protein2To whom correspondence should be addressed: Institute of Biophysical Chemistry, Goethe University Frankfurt, Max-von-Laue Str.9, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. vdoetsch@bpc.uni-frankfurt.de .Accession code-Coordinates for holo ACPI have been deposited in the protein databank under the code 2LIU.

The modular arrangement makes PKSand NRPS systems an interesting target for protein engineering (1). More than 200 novelpolyketide compounds have already been created; unfortunately, however, engineered PKSsoften fail to produce significant amounts of the desired products (2-4). Structural studiesmay faciliate yield improvement from engineered systems by providing a more completeunderstanding of the interface between the different domains. One example is the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthethase (DEBS PKS) from Saccharopolyspora erythraea.Docking experiments of ACP domains with the X-ray structure of the ketosynthase (KS) andacyltransferase (AT) di-domain of module 3 (KS3-AT3) for example suggest that the ACPdomain binds in a deep cleft between both domains with interactions mediated by helix II ofthe ACP (5). Mutations in this helix II affect the specificity of the system (6). Further studiesled to the conclusion that helix II is a universal \u201crecognition helix\u201d for interaction withdifferent enzymatic centers (7-11). While some information about domain-domaininteractions involving ketosynthase and acyltransferase is starting to emerge (12), little isknown about the interaction of ACP domains with other modifying enzymes such asmethyltransferases, epimerases or halogenases.Curacin A is an anticancer natural product derived from the marine cyanobacteriumLyngbya majuscula. It is generated by an unusual mixed PKS/NRPS system withcyclopropane and thiazoline moieties, as well as an internal cis double bond, and a terminalalkene. The biosynthesis of curacin A is mediated by a 2.2 MDa hybrid PKS-NRPS cluster(13, 14) (Figure 1). The first enzyme within the CurA PKS to act on the initial 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG) linked to ACPI is the curacin halogenase (CurA Hal). This isfollowed by the discrete dehydratase (ECH1) and decarboxylase (ECH2) that comprise the \u03b2-branching steps in formation of the cyclopropane ring (Figure 1) (15). The recently solvedcrystal structure of CurA Hal in five individual states differing in their substrate and cofactorcomposition has improved our understanding of its enzymatic mechanism (16). In addition,amino acids essential for the stereo-specific substrate recognition of (S)-HMG-ACP byCurA Hal could be identified by mutagenesis (16). The HMG substrate is presented by anunusual cluster of three tandem ACPs (ACPI,II,III). Little is known about the function ofthese multiple ACPs but recent studies have demonstrated that they enhance significantlythe efficiency of the multienzyme reaction leading to formation of methyl-cyclopropylacetyl-ACP (17).In this study we elucidated the structural basis for the selectivity that drives the interactionbetween CurA Hal and CurA ACPI,II,III and show that these triplet ACP domains arestructurally independent. Furthermore we report the NMR solution structures of holo-ACPI,and HMG-ACPI. NOE experiments indicated that no sequestration of the HMG substrateoccurs but it is instead presented on the ACP surface. Using mutational analysis we havemapped the protein-protein interaction surface between CurA HMG-ACPI and CurA Halthat not only includes the recognition helix II but also large parts of helix III.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONImpact of ACP repetition on the single domainThe triplet ACP domains (ACPI,II,III) are located at the C-terminus of the CurA module. Asshown using negative-stain electron microscopy, ACPI,II,III has a propensity to dimerizethrough a C-terminal domain (Cd-domain) (17). Our initial objective was to evaluatewhether the presence of the triplet ACPI,II,III domains or their dimer leads to domain-domaininteractions that adopt a preferred conformation. [15N, 1H]-TROSY spectra of the twoproteins CurA-ACPI,II,III with (in black) and without Cd (in red) were recorded andcompared (Figure 2). The absence of chemical shift differences indicates that noBusche et al.Page 2ACS Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 February 17.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript conformational changes occur. Some peaks decrease in intensity upon adding the 60 aa Cddomain. However, surprisingly we failed to observe new peaks representing the Cd domain.Due to dimerization the overall size increases from 36 kDa to 89 kDa (17). The increasedsize of the protein, in combination with some conformational exchange of the Cd domainmight broaden the resonances of the Cd domain beyond the detection limit. Parts whichtumble independently, such as the individual ACP domains are affected less by this increasein size (Figure 2).In the absence of clear evidence that the Cd domain can affect the conformation of the entireACP assembly, we decided to further analyze ACPI,II,III. The [15N, 1H]-TROSY spectrum ofACPI,II,III suffers from severe peak overlap due to the high sequence identity of theindividual domains (93-100%). The distinction of the individual domains was achieved bysegmental labeling, allowing the assignment of the full length construct (18). Analysis of theexcised ACPI, ACPII or ACPIII proteins resulted in [15N, 1H]-TROSY spectra with strongchemical shift perturbations (CSPs). Shift differences \u0394\u03b4 were calculated and plotted againstthe ACP sequence (Figure 2). For ACPI and ACPII chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) \u0394\u03b4 >0.4 ppm occurred for amino acids confined to the C-terminus and for ACPIII small CSPoccurred at the N-terminus reflecting differences in the environment of the linker region inthe isolated domain and the ACPI,II,III tri-domain (Figure 2). These data suggest that nodetectable interaction occurs between ACPI, ACPII and ACPIII. To further investigate thisquestion, we performed titration experiments of the 15N-labeled ACPI domain (residues1946-2043) with the ACPII,III di-domain (2044-2248) and the ACPI,II di-domain with 15N-labeled ACPIII. Both experiments failed to show chemical shift perturbations. Similarly, nointer-domain NOEs were detected in 3D 13C\u2013edited/15N-separated NOESY-HSQCexperiments with a [15N]ACPI\u2013 [13C]ACPII-ACPIII, labeled version (data not shown).Taken together these data establish that no detectable interactions occur between the ACPdomains of the triplet ACP cluster. To investigate the dynamics of the ACP linker regionswhich were found to be structured in other systems (5, 19, 20) we performed {1H}15Nheteronuclear NOE measurements. Nearly all amino acids of the structured domains ACPI,ACPII and ACPIII could be identified, and therefore the additional signals can be associatedwith the linker region. Heteronuclear NOE values of around 0.8 represent highly structuredregions, which is the case for the assigned amino acids within the ACP domains, whereasvalues around 0.2 were measured for the unassigned peaks indicating that the linkers areunstructured and highly flexible (Supplementary Figure 4).Taken together we show that the linker region is unstructured and that the ACP domainsbehave independently from each other in ACPI,II,III as well as in the dimerized form ofACPI,II,III-Cd. This leads to the conclusion that the interaction between Cur Hal and ACPdomains can be studied using one representing ACP domain of the triplet, for exampleACPI. The structure of holo ACPIACPI was expressed in its apo form and post-translationally modified in vitro. The purity ofthe apo protein and completeness of conversion to the holo form was investigated usingmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry analysis(Supplementary Figure 3). The structure was solved using standard NMR methods andstructural statistics are given in Table 1. Coordinates for holo ACPI have been deposited inthe Protein Data Bank under the accession code 2LIU.Holo ACPI consists of the expected right-hand twisted bundle formed by four major \u03b1-helices (I,II,III,VI) connected by three loops (21-25). Figure 3 shows a ribbon diagram ofthe minimized mean structure. Conformational exchange has been previously reported in theBusche et al.Page 3ACS Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 February 17.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript ACP and PCP family (25, 26), however, for ACPI only a single set of cross-peaks wasobserved with no indication of slow conformational exchange.The apo to holo ACPI conversion is accompanied by CSPs. The amino acids surrounding theactive site Ser1989 show the strongest perturbations between the apo and holo forms,including amino acids at the N-terminus of helix II and on helix III (all >0.05ppm CSP)(Figure 4). In addition 15N NOESY-HSQCs for apo and holo ACPI were measured.However, comparison of the NOE pattern of amino acids undergoing strong chemical shiftperturbations revealed minor differences between both states (Supplementary Figure 5)excluding major conformational changes upon formation of the holo state.Acyl-ACP During curacin A biosynthesis ACPI occurs in its holo, acetyl, HMG and 4-chloro-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (Cl-HMG) forms. To investigate these different chemical statesapo ACPI was loaded by the corresponding acyl-CoAs. For Cl-HMG loading the racemic(R,S)-HMG was used and enzymatically converted to 50% \u03b3-Cl-(S)-HMG-ACPI by Cur Haland 50% residual R-HMG-ACPI due to the stereo-specificity of the reaction (15). [15N, 1H]TROSY spectra of acetyl, HMG and \u03b3-Cl-HMG were compared to holo ACPI (Figure 5).The CSPs are small compared to the CSPs of the apo to holo conversion and are located nearthe active site Ser1989 on helices II and III. The CSPs increase from acetyl-to HMG-(~0.05ppm) and \u03b3-Cl-HMG-ACPI (~0.1ppm) (Figure 5).In previous solution NMR investigations of ACPs no NOEs between the protein and theprosthetic group were detected. This led to the assumption that no interactions or onlytransient interactions are present between the 4\u2032-Ppant arm and the surface of the ACPdomain (21-23). If the 4\u2032-Ppant arm is modified with larger substrates, however, associationwith the surface has been observed with the acyl chain bound in a cleft that is locatedbetween helices II and III. Examples are the FAS hexanoyl-ACP of E. coli (27) andoctanoyl-ACP from Streptomyces coelicolor (28). For a detailed characterization of theinteraction of ACPI with Cur Hal the localization of the substrate on the surface must first bedefined. To investigate potential contacts between the 4\u2032-Ppant arm and the protein weexpressed 13C/15N-labeled ACPI and modified it in vitro with unlabeled CoA and (R,S)-HMG-CoA. NOEs between 12CH groups of the attached cofactor and the 13CH groups ofthe protein were detected in a 3D F1-13C/15N filtered, F3-13C-separated NOESY (Figure 6).Surprisingly we could obtain NOEs with similar intensities for both holo and HMG ACPIreflecting that in both cases the 4\u2032-Ppant arm might be located similarly. In a next step werecorded F1/F2-13C/15N double-filtered 2D-NOESY spectra to selectively detectthe 12CH-12CH NOEs present within the 4\u2032-Ppant arm loaded with HMG (Figure 6). Usingthe previous assignments of the 4\u2032-Ppant arm loaded on other PCPs and ACPs (25, 29) wecould assign the 4\u2032-Ppant chain attached to ACPI. The 1D spectra of CoA and HMG-CoAthen gave rise to the unambiguous assignment of the protons of the HMG methyl group (66,67,68) (Supplementary Figure 6) and allowed us to assign the NOEs observed between theHMG and the protein. (Supplementary Table 2).To calculate the structure of HMG-ACPI we combined the restraints obtained for holo-ACPIwith the NOE-based distance restraints obtained for HMG, assuming that no majorconformational changes occur between the different states (Supplementary Figure 5, Table 1for structural statistics). The structure shows that the HMG-4\u2032-Ppant arm associates with thesurface of the ACP, but that this interaction is transient, allowing different orientations ofthe HMG group to occur (Figure 7). Structures of other ACP-substrate complexes hadshown a more tight interaction. X-ray studies of the E. coli FAS II ACP demonstrated thatstarting from C4 chain length the substrate and the 4\u2032-Ppant arm is sequestered into aBusche et al.Page 4ACS Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 February 17.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript hydrophobic pocket (27, 30). These results were similar to the NMR findings for the PKSactinorhodin system of Streptomyces coelicor (28).Interaction studies of ACPI with Cur HalThe curacin A biosynthetic pathway differs from other \u03b2-branching pathways in theintroduction of a \u03b3-chlorination step on (S)-HMG-ACPI mediated by Cur Hal, a non-hemeFe(II), \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (15). Recent studies showed that the chlorinationstep takes place before dehydration catalyzed by ECH1 and ECH2\u2013mediateddecarboxylation followed. Previous work has shown that ECH1 and ECH2 in the CurA \u03b2-branching cassette are more promiscuous enzymes. For example ECH1 can accommodateeither S-HMG-or \u03b3-Cl-(S)-HMG bound to ACPI,II,III (15), CurB (31) or in the acyl-CoAform, albeit with lower efficiency (32). By contrast, the halogenase CurA Hal was shown tobe stereo-specific as it distinguishes between R-and S-HMG (15, 16) and accepts S-HMGonly in an ACP-bound form. In order to assess the specificity determinants for thisinteraction Cur Hal was expressed, purified and reconstituted anaerobically as described (15,16) and its activity was confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figure 7).To identify the specific interaction surface on ACPI we titrated (R,S)-HMG-[15N]ACPI withactive, unlabeled CurA Hal, but no chemical shift perturbations could be observed. Theexperiment was repeated under non-reactive conditions: without Cl-, \u03b1-ketoglutarate or O2or missing all components. Subsequently the inactive mutant R241A (16) or Fe3+-reconstituted, inactive halogenase were tested. Finally, ACPI in apo, holo or loaded with thesubstrates acetyl or malonyl were titrated with functional halogenase. In all cases, despiteusing a high excess of the enzyme, no CSPs or line broadening effects were observed whichwould indicate formation of an HMG-ACPI/Cur Hal complex. To investigate if the reactionoccurs even in the absence of CSPs and to probe the specificity of the reaction, weperformed activity assays using CurA ACPI, CurB\u2013ACP and TycB1 PCP as a substratedonor. Only in the case of ACPI all S-HMG-ACPI was chlorinated within 10 min(Supplementary Figure 7). Even after 1 hr HMG-CurB and HMG-PCP did not convert to thechlorinated product (data not shown). This result demonstrates that Cur Hal distinguishesbetween these ACPs, leading to the conclusion that an interface must be present, whichcannot be detected by typical NMR titrations.To further investigate the CurA Hal/ACPI interaction surface, we mutated solvent exposed,not conserved amino acid (Supplementary Figure 8). Since we used (R,S)-HMG-ACPI as asubstrate, activity was determined by assuming that chlorination of 100% S-HMG results intwo peaks, one representing the unreacted R-HMG-ACP and the other one \u03b3-Cl-(S)-HMG-ACP, separated by 34 Da and of equal intensities (see MALDI MS in Supplementary Figure9 and the derived activities are listed in Supplementary Table 1). The mutations D1988Aand I1990A neighboring the active site Ser1989 and A2009R on helix III had the strongestimpact on the chlorination efficiency (activity: 29 \u00b1 10%; 18 \u00b1 7%; 15 \u00b1 12%, respectively).In these cases no product peaks were observed. However, the first and second sodiumadduct peaks (~+22 and ~+44 Da) might overlap with a small product peak. To avoidunderestimation of the product yield we assumed the peak intensity at a distance of 34 Da tobe product (Supplementary Figure 9). This leads to an overestimation rather than anunderestimation of the activity, making clear that these mutations reduce the activitysignificantly. The single point mutations T2010A, Y2013A and D2014A on helix IIIdecrease the activity to 37 \u00b1 7%, 35% \u00b1 2% and 59 \u00b1 2%, respectively. Circular dichroism(CD) curves of the less active ACPI mutants showed that the mutations did not have animpact on the global fold. Melting temperatures (TM) derived from CD melting curvesshowed that the mutations D1988A and D2014A destabilize the protein (SupplementaryTable 1, Supplementary Figure 10). To ensure that a strong reduction by a mutation is notsimply caused by structural perturbations we compared [15N, 1H] TROSY spectra ofBusche et al.Page 5ACS Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 February 17.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript mutants with the WT (Supplementary Figure 11) revealing for D1988A and I1990A CSPsfor only 5-6 amino acids located near the mutation site, suggesting that these mutations donot affect the structure. The mutation A2009R leads to stronger CSPs which might be due tostructural rearrangements. We were interested whether these mutations might lead to adisplacement of the cofactor which in turn affects the Cur Hal/ACP interaction. We loadedthe mutants D1988A, I1990A and A2009R with the 4\u2032-Ppant arm, acetyl and HMG, mappedthe CSPs against the sequence and compared these results with the WT (SupplementaryFigure 12). Interestingly in all cases the same amino acids showed CSPs, suggesting that thelocalization of the cofactor is not affected (Supplementary Figure 12). Mapping themutations with the strongest effects onto the structure of HMG-ACPI shows that theseamino acids surround the substrate and form a contiguous surface suggesting its importancefor Cur Hal recognition and selectivity (Figure 8).Overall our data demonstrate that Cur Hal interacts with ACPI specifically, which is likelyapplicable to Cur Hal interaction also with ACPII and ACPIII of the tri-domain. Cur Halrecognizes an interface consisting mainly of the N-terminus of helix II, the 4\u2032-Ppant armwith its substrate, and helix III. Substrate attached to a different carrier domain (either ACPor PCP) is not recognized by the halogenase. The importance of presenting the substrate aspart of an entire substrate-ACP complex is also demonstrated by the fact that the isolatedHMG-CoA does not serve as a substrate for CurA Hal. In contrast to high specificity of theHal, it is evident that ECH1 and ECH2 \u03b2-branching cassette enzymes are less specific andcan accommodate acyl-CoAs, albeit with significantly lower efficiency. The radicalmechanism involved in the chlorination step (inherently highly reactive and less specific) ispossibly the driving force for the Hal acyl-ACP specificity. The requirement of presentingthe correct substrate within a specific environment might be necessary to prevent non-specific chlorination or a competing hydroxylation reaction of substrates presented by otherACPs. For example, CurB is a discrete ACP that can freely diffuse, and should therefore beable to interact with Cur Hal.Surprisingly, it was not possible to directly detect the interactions between ACPI and CurHal by NMR spectroscopy. Weak or transient interactions are difficult to detect using thestandard NMR experiments due to the low population and transiency of the complex. Onetechnique for investigating these transient interactions is paramagnetic relaxationenhancement (PRE) measurements. Spin labels attached to one partner result in relaxationenhancement in the other partner even when the contact time is short and the complexunstable (33-36). We therefore attempted to apply PRE experiments to our system, in orderto visualize low populated states. Unfortunately no spin label could be attached to Cur Halbecause the removal of the WT cysteine (Cys19Ala) as well as the insertion of newcysteines into Cur Hal (C19S, I61C, H109C, G111C, Y274C, H168C and S178C) resultedin protein precipitation.Our results demonstrate that the individual CurA ACPs of the ACPI,II,III tri-domain do notinteract with each other. Previous studies have shown that the advantage of a tripletassembly over a single ACP is the increase of the efficiency of the entire enzyme reaction(17). It has been proposed that this clustering of ACP-linked substrates might result inbinding of adjacent enzymes to corresponding substrates through non-specific enzyme\u2013substrate interactions (17). Further kinetic and enzymatic investigation of Cur ACPI,II,III tri-domain involving intact CurA module might reveal the basis for tandem ACP function andwhether increasing the local concentration of potential substrate rather than distinctconformational effects affect higher efficiency during polyketide chain elongation in thecuracin A pathway.Busche et al.Page 6ACS Chem Biol.

Media were supplemented with0.8 ml 0.05 M Fe-II-solution in order to prevent modifications by an endogenous PPTase(37). All proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The constructs of CurHal and CurB were described previously (15, 31). Hal was expressed, purified andreconstituted as described previously (31) (Supplemantary materials and Methods). CurBwas expressed in BL21 star-pRARE (Novagen) and expressed and purified like ACPI.TycB1 PCP was cloned into pBH4 using and expressed and purified as ACPI.Loading of ACPThe recombinant ACPs (200 \u03bcM) were artificially loaded with either coenzyme A (CoA) oranalogs (Acetyl-, Malonyl-, HMG-CoA) by using the promiscuous Bacillus subtilisphosphopantetheinyl (Ppant) transferase Sfp (3 \u03bcM). The loading reaction was incubated atroom temperature for 1 hr in buffered aqueous solution (pH 7.5, 20 mM HEPES, 50 mMNaCl, 20 mM MgCl2). To ensure that complete loading was achieved the reaction mixturewas analyzed directly by MALDI-MS (Supplemantary Figure 3).Activity AssayFor the reactivity test Hal was purified and reconstituted as described. 100 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcMHMG-ACP in 20 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 were supplemented with 0.5 mM fresh\u03b1-KG and 75 \u03bcM Fe-II-SO4 and 5 \u03bcM Hal. The reaction was incubated at 25 \u00b0C undershaking (800 rpm), after 10 min the reaction was completed. The reaction products wereanalysed using MALDI-MS. The experiments were performed three times.Mass SpectrometryMass spectra were recorded on a MALDI-TOF mass analyzer (Voyager STR, AppliedBiosystems) in linear positive ion mode. Samples were diluted with water to a concentrationof 5\u201310 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcl was mixed with 1 \u03bcl MALDI matrix (sDHB, Bruker) directly on thesample target. Spectra were accumulated over 50-100 laser shots.NMR spectroscopy of holo ACP0.6-1 mM solutions of ACPI were prepared in 50 mM arginine/50 mM glutamate buffer atpH 6.8 containing 5% D2O and 0,15 mM DSS (4, 4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate).NMR spectra were collected at a temperature of 291 K on 950, 900, 800 and 600 MHz onBruker Avance spectrometers equipped with cryogenic 5mm z-axis gradient triple resonanceprobes and a 500 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with 5 mm x,y,z-axis gradienttriple resonance room temperature probe. For backbone and aliphatic side chain assignments[15N, 1H] TROSY (38) version of HSQC, HNCACO, HNCO, HNCACB, (H)C(CCO)NH-TOCSY, and H(CCCO)NH-TOCSY were recorded. Aromatic ring resonances wereassigned with (H)CB(CGCC-TOCSY)Har experiments (39). 15N and 13C separated 3DNOESY experiments were recorded with 70 ms mixing time. All spectra were processedwith TopSpin (Bruker Biospin) and analysed with Sparky (40). For the acyl chain bindingstudies, standard sensitivity-enhanced [15N, 1H]-TROSY spectra were acquired.

For the assignment of the unlabeled cofactor a 2D F1/F2-13C/15N double-filtered NOESY experiment (42) with 150 ms mixing time was acquired at 950 MHz.Fully 13C/15N-labeled ACPI was loaded with unlabeled 12C HMG-CoA and the protein wasconcentrated to 1mM in 25 mM NaPi and 50 mM NaCl at a pH of 6.8 and measured at291K. Structure CalculationBackbone torsion angle restraints were obtained from chemical shift data using the TALOS+algorithm (43). NOE-based distance restraints from 3D 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13C-NOESY HSQC spectra were assigned automatically by CYANA (44, 45), which was alsoused for the structure calculations by torsion angle dynamics (46). The final structurecalculations included 2852 distance restraints and 162 backbone torsion angle restraints(Table 1). 100 conformers were computed using 10000 torsion angle dynamics steps. The 20conformers with the lowest target function values were subjected to restrained energyrefinement with the program OPALP (47) using the AMBER force field (48). The quality ofthe structures was checked by PROCHECK (49) and WHATCHECK (50).Structure calculations with HMGA model of HMG was created using the online version of the program CORINA for 3Dstructure generation (http://www.molecular-networks.com/online_demos/corina_demo).HMG was attached covalently to the Ser1989 residue. For the structure calculation withCYANA (51), a residue consisting of a serine backbone connected to the HMG cofactor wasadded to the standard residue library and the dataset was complemented with additionalNOE information for the cofactor. The resulting structures were subjected to restrainedenergy minimization using OPALp (47). The necessary partial charges for HMG-serinewere calculated using the PRODRG server (52).Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Acknowledgments Special thanks go to U.

        "Japan.Polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are largemultidomain proteins present in microorganisms that produce bioactive compounds. CuracinA is such a bioactive compound with potent anti-proliferative activity. During itsbiosynthesis the growing substrate is bound covalently to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) thatis able to access catalytic sites of neighboring domains for chain elongation andmodification. While ACP domains usually occur as monomers, the curacin A cluster codesfor a triplet ACP (ACPI-ACPII-ACPIII) within the CurA PKS module. We have determinedthe structure of the isolated holo ACPI and show that the ACPs are independent of eachother within this tri-domain system. In addition, we have determined the structure of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-loaded holo-ACPI, which is the substrate for the uniquehalogenase (Hal) domain embedded within the CurA module. We have identified theinteraction surface of both proteins using mutagenesis and MALDI-based identification ofproduct formation.

        "(ACP) in PKSs or a holo peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) in NRPSs and is passed from onemodule to another along the chain of reaction centers. The modular arrangement makes PKSand NRPS systems an interesting target for protein engineering (1). More than 200 novelpolyketide compounds have already been created; unfortunately, however, engineered PKSsoften fail to produce significant amounts of the desired products (2-4). Structural studiesmay faciliate yield improvement from engineered systems by providing a more completeunderstanding of the interface between the different domains. One example is the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthethase (DEBS PKS) from Saccharopolyspora erythraea.Docking experiments of ACP domains with the X-ray structure of the ketosynthase (KS) andacyltransferase (AT) di-domain of module 3 (KS3-AT3) for example suggest that the ACPdomain binds in a deep cleft between both domains with interactions mediated by helix II ofthe ACP (5). Mutations in this helix II affect the specificity of the system (6). Further studiesled to the conclusion that helix II is a universal \u201crecognition helix\u201d for interaction withdifferent enzymatic centers (7-11). While some information about domain-domaininteractions involving ketosynthase and acyltransferase is starting to emerge (12), little isknown about the interaction of ACP domains with other modifying enzymes such asmethyltransferases, epimerases or",
        "halogenases.Curacin A is an anticancer natural product derived from the marine cyanobacteriumLyngbya majuscula. It is generated by an unusual mixed PKS/NRPS system withcyclopropane and thiazoline moieties, as well as an internal cis double bond, and a terminalalkene. The biosynthesis of curacin A is mediated by a 2.2 MDa hybrid PKS-NRPS cluster(13, 14) (Figure 1). The first enzyme within the CurA PKS to act on the initial 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG) linked to ACPI is the curacin halogenase (CurA Hal). This isfollowed by the discrete dehydratase (ECH1) and decarboxylase (ECH2) that comprise the \u03b2-branching steps in formation of the cyclopropane ring (Figure 1) (15). The recently solvedcrystal structure of CurA Hal in five individual states differing in their substrate and cofactorcomposition has improved our understanding of its enzymatic mechanism (16). In addition,amino acids essential for the stereo-specific substrate recognition of (S)-HMG-ACP byCurA Hal could be identified by mutagenesis (16). The HMG substrate is presented by anunusual cluster of three tandem ACPs (ACPI,II,III). Little is known about the function ofthese multiple ACPs but recent studies have demonstrated that they enhance significantlythe efficiency of the multienzyme reaction leading to formation of methyl-cyclopropylacetyl-ACP",

        "conformational changes occur. Some peaks decrease in intensity upon adding the 60 aa Cddomain. However, surprisingly we failed to observe new peaks representing the Cd domain.Due to dimerization the overall size increases from 36 kDa to 89 kDa (17). The increasedsize of the protein, in combination with some conformational exchange of the Cd domainmight broaden the resonances of the Cd domain beyond the detection limit. Parts whichtumble independently, such as the individual ACP domains are affected less by this increasein size (Figure",
        "2).In the absence of clear evidence that the Cd domain can affect the conformation of the entireACP assembly, we decided to further analyze ACPI,II,III. The [15N, 1H]-TROSY spectrum ofACPI,II,III suffers from severe peak overlap due to the high sequence identity of theindividual domains (93-100%). The distinction of the individual domains was achieved bysegmental labeling, allowing the assignment of the full length construct (18). Analysis of theexcised ACPI, ACPII or ACPIII proteins resulted in [15N, 1H]-TROSY spectra with strongchemical shift perturbations (CSPs). Shift differences \u0394\u03b4 were calculated and plotted againstthe ACP sequence (Figure 2). For ACPI and ACPII chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) \u0394\u03b4 >0.4 ppm occurred for amino acids confined to the C-terminus and for ACPIII small CSPoccurred at the N-terminus reflecting differences in the environment of the linker region inthe isolated domain and the ACPI,II,III tri-domain (Figure 2). These data suggest that nodetectable interaction occurs between ACPI, ACPII and ACPIII. To further investigate thisquestion, we performed titration experiments of the 15N-labeled ACPI domain (residues1946-2043) with the ACPII,III di-domain (2044-2248) and the ACPI,II di-domain with 15N-labeled ACPIII. Both experiments failed to show chemical shift perturbations. Similarly, nointer-domain NOEs were detected in 3D 13C\u2013edited/15N-separated NOESY-HSQCexperiments with a [15N]ACPI\u2013 [13C]ACPII-ACPIII, labeled version (data not shown).Taken together these data establish that no detectable interactions occur between the ACPdomains of the triplet ACP cluster. To investigate the dynamics of the ACP linker regionswhich were found to be structured in other systems (5, 19, 20) we performed {1H}15Nheteronuclear NOE measurements. Nearly all amino acids of the structured domains ACPI,ACPII and ACPIII could be identified, and therefore the additional signals can be associatedwith the linker region. Heteronuclear NOE values of around 0.8 represent highly structuredregions, which is the case for the assigned amino acids within the ACP domains, whereasvalues around 0.2 were measured for the unassigned peaks indicating that the linkers areunstructured and highly flexible (Supplementary Figure",
        "4).Taken together we show that the linker region is unstructured and that the ACP domainsbehave independently from each other in ACPI,II,III as well as in the dimerized form ofACPI,II,III-Cd. This leads to the conclusion that the interaction between Cur Hal and ACPdomains can be studied using one representing ACP domain of the triplet, for exampleACPI.",

        "During curacin A biosynthesis ACPI occurs in its holo, acetyl, HMG and 4-chloro-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (Cl-HMG) forms. To investigate these different chemical statesapo ACPI was loaded by the corresponding acyl-CoAs. For Cl-HMG loading the racemic(R,S)-HMG was used and enzymatically converted to 50% \u03b3-Cl-(S)-HMG-ACPI by Cur Haland 50% residual R-HMG-ACPI due to the stereo-specificity of the reaction (15). [15N, 1H]TROSY spectra of acetyl, HMG and \u03b3-Cl-HMG were compared to holo ACPI (Figure 5).The CSPs are small compared to the CSPs of the apo to holo conversion and are located nearthe active site Ser1989 on helices II and III. The CSPs increase from acetyl-to HMG-(~0.05ppm) and \u03b3-Cl-HMG-ACPI (~0.1ppm) (Figure",
        "5).In previous solution NMR investigations of ACPs no NOEs between the protein and theprosthetic group were detected. This led to the assumption that no interactions or onlytransient interactions are present between the 4\u2032-Ppant arm and the surface of the ACPdomain (21-23). If the 4\u2032-Ppant arm is modified with larger substrates, however, associationwith the surface has been observed with the acyl chain bound in a cleft that is locatedbetween helices II and III. Examples are the FAS hexanoyl-ACP of E. coli (27) andoctanoyl-ACP from Streptomyces coelicolor (28). For a detailed characterization of theinteraction of ACPI with Cur Hal the localization of the substrate on the surface must first bedefined. To investigate potential contacts between the 4\u2032-Ppant arm and the protein weexpressed 13C/15N-labeled ACPI and modified it in vitro with unlabeled CoA and (R,S)-HMG-CoA. NOEs between 12CH groups of the attached cofactor and the 13CH groups ofthe protein were detected in a 3D F1-13C/15N filtered, F3-13C-separated NOESY (Figure 6).Surprisingly we could obtain NOEs with similar intensities for both holo and HMG ACPIreflecting that in both cases the 4\u2032-Ppant arm might be located similarly. In a next step werecorded F1/F2-13C/15N double-filtered 2D-NOESY spectra to selectively detectthe 12CH-12CH NOEs present within the 4\u2032-Ppant arm loaded with HMG (Figure 6). Usingthe previous assignments of the 4\u2032-Ppant arm loaded on other PCPs and ACPs (25, 29) wecould assign the 4\u2032-Ppant chain attached to ACPI. The 1D spectra of CoA and HMG-CoAthen gave rise to the unambiguous assignment of the protons of the HMG methyl group (66,67,68) (Supplementary Figure 6) and allowed us to assign the NOEs observed between theHMG and the protein. (Supplementary Table",
        "2).To calculate the structure of HMG-ACPI we combined the restraints obtained for holo-ACPIwith the NOE-based distance restraints obtained for HMG, assuming that no majorconformational changes occur between the different states (Supplementary Figure 5, Table 1for structural statistics). The structure shows that the HMG-4\u2032-Ppant arm associates with thesurface of the ACP, but that this interaction is transient, allowing different orientations ofthe HMG group to occur (Figure 7). Structures of other ACP-substrate complexes hadshown a more tight interaction.

        "HalThe curacin A biosynthetic pathway differs from other \u03b2-branching pathways in theintroduction of a \u03b3-chlorination step on (S)-HMG-ACPI mediated by Cur Hal, a non-hemeFe(II), \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (15). Recent studies showed that the chlorinationstep takes place before dehydration catalyzed by ECH1 and ECH2\u2013mediateddecarboxylation followed. Previous work has shown that ECH1 and ECH2 in the CurA \u03b2-branching cassette are more promiscuous enzymes. For example ECH1 can accommodateeither S-HMG-or \u03b3-Cl-(S)-HMG bound to ACPI,II,III (15), CurB (31) or in the acyl-CoAform, albeit with lower efficiency (32). By contrast, the halogenase CurA Hal was shown tobe stereo-specific as it distinguishes between R-and S-HMG (15, 16) and accepts S-HMGonly in an ACP-bound form. In order to assess the specificity determinants for thisinteraction Cur Hal was expressed, purified and reconstituted anaerobically as described (15,16) and its activity was confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figure 7).To identify the specific interaction surface on ACPI we titrated (R,S)-HMG-[15N]ACPI withactive, unlabeled CurA Hal, but no chemical shift perturbations could be observed. Theexperiment was repeated under non-reactive conditions: without Cl-, \u03b1-ketoglutarate or O2or missing all components. Subsequently the inactive mutant R241A (16) or Fe3+-reconstituted, inactive halogenase were tested. Finally, ACPI in apo, holo or loaded with thesubstrates acetyl or malonyl were titrated with functional halogenase. In all cases, despiteusing a high excess of the enzyme, no CSPs or line broadening effects were observed whichwould indicate formation of an HMG-ACPI/Cur Hal complex. To investigate if the reactionoccurs even in the absence of CSPs and to probe the specificity of the reaction, weperformed activity assays using CurA ACPI, CurB\u2013ACP and TycB1 PCP as a substratedonor. Only in the case of ACPI all S-HMG-ACPI was chlorinated within 10 min(Supplementary Figure 7). Even after 1 hr HMG-CurB and HMG-PCP did not convert to thechlorinated product (data not shown). This result demonstrates that Cur Hal distinguishesbetween these ACPs, leading to the conclusion that an interface must be present, whichcannot be detected by typical NMR",
        "titrations.To further investigate the CurA Hal/ACPI interaction surface, we mutated solvent exposed,not conserved amino acid (Supplementary Figure 8). Since we used (R,S)-HMG-ACPI as asubstrate, activity was determined by assuming that chlorination of 100% S-HMG results intwo peaks, one representing the unreacted R-HMG-ACP and the other one \u03b3-Cl-(S)-HMG-ACP, separated by 34 Da and of equal intensities (see MALDI MS in Supplementary Figure9 and the derived activities are listed in Supplementary Table 1). The mutations D1988Aand I1990A neighboring the active site Ser1989 and A2009R on helix III had the strongestimpact on the chlorination efficiency (activity: 29 \u00b1 10%; 18 \u00b1 7%; 15 \u00b1 12%, respectively).In these cases no product peaks were observed. However, the first and second sodiumadduct peaks (~+22 and ~+44 Da) might overlap with a small product peak. To avoidunderestimation of the product yield we assumed the peak intensity at a distance of 34 Da tobe product (Supplementary Figure 9). This leads to an overestimation rather than anunderestimation of the activity, making clear that these mutations reduce the activitysignificantly. The single point mutations T2010A, Y2013A and D2014A on helix IIIdecrease the activity to 37 \u00b1 7%, 35% \u00b1 2% and 59 \u00b1 2%, respectively. Circular dichroism(CD) curves of the less active ACPI mutants showed that the mutations did not have animpact on the global fold. Melting temperatures (TM) derived from CD melting curvesshowed that the mutations D1988A and D2014A destabilize the protein (SupplementaryTable 1, Supplementary Figure 10).

The mutation A2009R leads to stronger CSPs which might be due tostructural rearrangements. We were interested whether these mutations might lead to adisplacement of the cofactor which in turn affects the Cur Hal/ACP interaction. We loadedthe mutants D1988A, I1990A and A2009R with the 4\u2032-Ppant arm, acetyl and HMG, mappedthe CSPs against the sequence and compared these results with the WT (SupplementaryFigure 12). Interestingly in all cases the same amino acids showed CSPs, suggesting that thelocalization of the cofactor is not affected (Supplementary Figure 12). Mapping themutations with the strongest effects onto the structure of HMG-ACPI shows that theseamino acids surround the substrate and form a contiguous surface suggesting its importancefor Cur Hal recognition and selectivity (Figure",
        "8).Overall our data demonstrate that Cur Hal interacts with ACPI specifically, which is likelyapplicable to Cur Hal interaction also with ACPII and ACPIII of the tri-domain. Cur Halrecognizes an interface consisting mainly of the N-terminus of helix II, the 4\u2032-Ppant armwith its substrate, and helix III. Substrate attached to a different carrier domain (either ACPor PCP) is not recognized by the halogenase. The importance of presenting the substrate aspart of an entire substrate-ACP complex is also demonstrated by the fact that the isolatedHMG-CoA does not serve as a substrate for CurA Hal. In contrast to high specificity of theHal, it is evident that ECH1 and ECH2 \u03b2-branching cassette enzymes are less specific andcan accommodate acyl-CoAs, albeit with significantly lower efficiency. The radicalmechanism involved in the chlorination step (inherently highly reactive and less specific) ispossibly the driving force for the Hal acyl-ACP specificity. The requirement of presentingthe correct substrate within a specific environment might be necessary to prevent non-specific chlorination or a competing hydroxylation reaction of substrates presented by otherACPs. For example, CurB is a discrete ACP that can freely diffuse, and should therefore beable to interact with Cur",
        "Hal.Surprisingly, it was not possible to directly detect the interactions between ACPI and CurHal by NMR spectroscopy. Weak or transient interactions are difficult to detect using thestandard NMR experiments due to the low population and transiency of the complex. Onetechnique for investigating these transient interactions is paramagnetic relaxationenhancement (PRE) measurements. Spin labels attached to one partner result in relaxationenhancement in the other partner even when the contact time is short and the complexunstable (33-36). We therefore attempted to apply PRE experiments to our system, in orderto visualize low populated states. Unfortunately no spin label could be attached to Cur Halbecause the removal of the WT cysteine (Cys19Ala) as well as the insertion of newcysteines into Cur Hal (C19S, I61C, H109C, G111C, Y274C, H168C and S178C) resultedin protein",

Previous studies have shown that the advantage of a tripletassembly over a single ACP is the increase of the efficiency of the entire enzyme reaction(17). It has been proposed that this clustering of ACP-linked substrates might result inbinding of adjacent enzymes to corresponding substrates through non-specific enzyme\u2013substrate interactions (17). Further kinetic and enzymatic investigation of Cur ACPI,II,III tri-domain involving intact CurA module might reveal the basis for tandem ACP function andwhether increasing the local concentration of potential substrate rather than distinctconformational effects affect higher efficiency during polyketide chain elongation in thecuracin A",

For the assignment of the unlabeled cofactor a 2D F1/F2-13C/15N double-filtered NOESY experiment (42) with 150 ms mixing time was acquired at 950 MHz.Fully 13C/15N-labeled ACPI was loaded with unlabeled 12C HMG-CoA and the protein wasconcentrated to 1mM in 25 mM NaPi and 50 mM NaCl at a pH of 6.8 and measured at291K.",

        "CalculationBackbone torsion angle restraints were obtained from chemical shift data using the TALOS+algorithm (43). NOE-based distance restraints from 3D 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13C-NOESY HSQC spectra were assigned automatically by CYANA (44, 45), which was alsoused for the structure calculations by torsion angle dynamics (46). The final structurecalculations included 2852 distance restraints and 162 backbone torsion angle restraints(Table 1). 100 conformers were computed using 10000 torsion angle dynamics steps. The 20conformers with the lowest target function values were subjected to restrained energyrefinement with the program OPALP (47) using the AMBER force field (48). The quality ofthe structures was checked by PROCHECK (49) and WHATCHECK",

        "HMGA model of HMG was created using the online version of the program CORINA for 3Dstructure generation (http://www.molecular-networks.com/online_demos/corina_demo).HMG was attached covalently to the Ser1989 residue. For the structure calculation withCYANA (51), a residue consisting of a serine backbone connected to the HMG cofactor wasadded to the standard residue library and the dataset was complemented with additionalNOE information for the cofactor. The resulting structures were subjected to restrainedenergy minimization using OPALp (47). The necessary partial charges for HMG-serinewere calculated using the PRODRG server",
