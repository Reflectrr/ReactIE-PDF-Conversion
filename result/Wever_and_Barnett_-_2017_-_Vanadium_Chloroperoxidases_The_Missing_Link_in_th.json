Ron Wever*[a] and Phil Barnett[b] Chem. Asian J. 2017, 12, 1997 \u2013 2007 T 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1997 Focus ReviewDOI: 10.1002/asia.201700420 Abstract: It is well established that the majority of chlorinat-ed organic substances found in the terrestrial environment are produced naturally. The presence of these compounds in soils is not limited to a single ecosystem. Natural chlorina-tion is also a widespread phenomenon in grasslands and ag-ricultural soils typical for unforested areas. These chlorinated compounds are formed from chlorination of natural organic matter consisting of very complex chemical structures, such as lignin. Chlorination of several lignin model compounds re-sults in the intermediate formation of trichloroacetyl-con-taining compounds, which are also found in soils. These decay, in general, through a haloform-type reaction mecha-nism to CHCl3. Upon release into the atmosphere, CHCl3 will produce chlorine radicals through photolysis, which will, in turn, lead to natural depletion of ozone. There is evidence that fungal chloroperoxidases able to produce HOCl are in-volved in the chlorination of natural organic matter. The ob-jective of this review is to clarify the role and source of the various chloroperoxidases involved in the natural formation of CHCl3. 1. Introduction Both marine and terrestrial ecosystems produce and release halogenated compounds. Brominated compounds dominate the marine environment[1, 2a,b] and chlorinated organics are ma-jorly produced on land[3] by chlorination of natural organic matter. This substrate consists of complex chemical structures, such as lignin. Several studies set up to investigate chlorination of lignin by using 1,3-dihydroxy aromatic model compounds and humic acid revealed intermediate formation of several tri-chloroacetyl-containing compounds.[4, 5] These compounds, no-tably found in forest soils,[6] in general, decay to CHCl3 through a haloform-type reaction mechanism favored under slightly al-kaline conditions.[7] These data show that CHCl3 may be consid-ered as a natural compound in forest ecosystems.[8, 9] Chlorina-tion of dissolved organic material in freshwater by bleach also leads to the formation of CHCl3 and other volatile metabo-lites;[10, 11] a mechanism thus similar to natural chlorination. The presence of natural chlorinated organic compounds in soils and the formation of CHCl3 [8] is not limited to temperate forest ecosystems. An extensive study showed that natural chlorina-tion was widespread and included grasslands and agricultural soils typical of unforested areas.[12] Boreal forest soils also emit CHCl3 in similar amounts to that of more southern ecosys-tems.[13] Substantial emissions of CHCl3 have also been report-ed for tundra soil in Alaska,[14] hypersaline sediments,[15] and sediments from a moderately acidic salt lake.[16] In temperate conifer ecosystems, CHCl3 production is associated with micro-bial processes in the accumulated organic top layer of the soil.[17a\u2013d] Temperature sensitivity also indicates that chlorination in forest soils is a primarily biotic and enzymatic process. How-ever, abiotic chlorination may also occur, in which iron(III) in soils plays a catalytic role.[18] Although key enzyme systems and relevant microorganisms are yet to be fully identified,[19a,b] it is very likely, as discussed herein, that fungal chloroperoxi-dases (CPOs) able to oxidize chloride to hypochlorous acid are involved [Eq. (1)] . H2O2 \u00fe H\u00fe \u00fe Cl@ ! HOCl\u00fe H2O \u00f01\u00de Most researchers in the field use the monochlorodimedone assay (Figure 1) to detect and quantify CPO activity. Indeed, CPO activity has been observed in several soil ex-tracts,[20, 21] with properties similar to those of the CPO from Caldariomyces fumago.[22] A metagenomic-based survey on soil samples from a German forest showed that species of organ-isms involved in microbial (de)halogenation were present.[23] Genes were detected in the soil samples that corresponded to heme-dependent and vanadium haloperoxidases. However, the origin of these genes was not further specified. The objective of this review is to pinpoint which enzymatic systems may be involved in the natural formation of CHCl3. The relevant prop-erties of these systems, with respect to formation of CHCl3, is discussed and, in particular, the potential role of vanadium CPOs is highlighted. With few exceptions, these vanadium CPOs have been largely ignored in the literature.[17b, 19, 24] Figure 1. The monochlorodimedone assay is widely used to detect quantita-2. Haloperoxidases and Halogenases 2.1. Non-Heme Bacterial Haloperoxidases and Flavin-Dependent Halogenases Originally, bacterial perhydrolases found in bacteria such as Pseudomonas fluorescence were designated as CPOs. This bac-terial species produces the chlorinated antifungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin. These perhydrolases do not contain a heme group or metal ions.[25] Initially, it was assumed that such enzymes from these species were involved in substrate-/product-specific pathways. These and other bacterial non-heme non-metalloha-loperoxidases, in the presence of an organic acid and H2O2, catalyze unspecific halogenations by forming peroxyacid; a strong oxidizing agent that is able to directly oxidize halide ions to form hypohalous acid.[25] This reaction is, however, un-likely to occur under natural conditions because both a high concentration of the organic acid is required and millimolar-range concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. It is therefore im-portant to note that not all bacterial non-heme CPOs are real haloperoxidases. In this case, the activity, perhydrolysis, is more a quirk of nature than a means to an end. Unfortunately, there are still examples in the literature that define these perhydro-lases as CPOs. Unquestionably, there are a number of bacterial enzymes that are responsible for the formation of halogenated antibiotics, but these are typically dependent on flavin. These enzymes function through the intermediate formation of a flavin hydroperoxide formed by the reaction of oxygen, FADH2 (FAD = flavin adenine dinucleotide), and a halide ion. The subsequently formed hypohalous acid diffuses along the protein\u2019s channel to form a long-lived chlorinated intermedi-ate, which reacts with a specifically bound substrate.[26] HOCl does not leave the active site, which makes these substrate-specific, O2-dependent halogenases unlikely to be involved in the formation of CHCl3 in soils. In addition, the enzymatic activ-ity of these flavin-dependent halogenases is very low (turnover number 1\u20137 min@1).[27] This is in contrast to the study based on chlorine isotope effects by Aeppli et al. ,[28] who suggested some involvement of these flavin-dependent halogenases in the formation of organochlorines. 2.2. Non-Heme Fe2 + Halogenases This highly homologous group of chlorinases from, for exam-ple, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, and Lyngbya species are in-volved in the biosynthesis of natural chlorinated products.[29a\u2013e] They share about 20\u201357 % sequence identity and use non-heme iron, O2, and 2-ketoglutarate to catalyze the chlorination of a-amino acids at aliphatic side-chain positions. To function as a substrate, the amino acid must be linked as a thioester to a phosphopantetheine tether. The reaction mechanism in-volves a haloferryl species that cleaves aliphatic C@H bonds in the bound substrate, which results in the formation of halo-genated intermediates. Recently, an iron-dependent halogen-ase was discovered in cyanobacteria that was able to chlori-nate stereospecifically a free-standing Fischer indole.[29f] Again, this is a group of enzymes that has a very specific binding site for their substrates and it is not probable that other substrates are chlorinated. Thus, free and diffusible HOCl is not formed and it is unlikely that these enzymes are a source of CHCl3. 2.3. Heme-Containing Haloperoxidases 2.3.1. Heme-Containing CPOs The classical representative of this class of enzymes is the heme-containing CPO from the filamentous fungus C. fumago discovered in 1959.[30] This fungus from the class of Ascomy-cetes produces caldariomycin; a cyclopentane derivative con-taining two chlorine atoms.[31] This enzyme belongs to the heme thiolate peroxidases and is well characterized.[32\u201334] It has been extensively studied for its synthetic applications because its peroxygenase activity allows hydroxylation of C@H bonds (benzylic hydroxylation), epoxidation of double bonds, and sul-foxidation. Although easily inactivated by the substrate, hydro-gen peroxide, and its product, HOCl, the enzyme is popular for chlorination studies owing to its commercial availability and in-itial high turnover (1000 s@1).[34] The low optimum pH (around 3.0) of the enzyme for chloride oxidation by hydrogen perox-ide[34] displays a Km for hydrogen peroxide of around 0.2 mm and for chloride of around 5 mm.[31, 34] HOCl or HOBr formed has been postulated to be released and could thus nonspecifi-cally halogenate organic compounds.[35] As shown in Figure 2, this CPO is readily inactivated above 50 8C. Also, storage at slightly elevated temperatures leads to rapid inactivation.[36] Ron Wever is Professor in Biocatalysis at the University of Amsterdam, from which he re-tired in 2012. His research was focused on metalloproteins and their reactions with oxygen or oxygen derivatives. His group dis-covered a new class of enzymes, the vanadi-um haloperoxidases, in which vanadium is the prosthetic group. In 2016, he received the Vanadis Award for his ongoing contributions in elucidating the structure and function of these enzymes. His latest research activities also dealt with enzymes able to phosphory-late or sulfate compounds, with the aim of re-placing chemical synthesis methods by more cleaner biocatalytic procedures. Phil Barnett works as Assistant Professor in the Department of Anatomy, Embryology and Physiology at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. He trained as a Ph.D. student in biochemistry under Ron Wever, focusing on protein structure and function of vanadium haloperoxidases (1997). After a post-doctoral position of three years studying peroxisomal protein import, he switched his research focus to another area of interest, namely, mammali-an gene regulation and disease. His current research is set around trying to understand human genetic variation and its influence on transcriptional responses and conduction dis-eases of the heart. Chem.

KGaA, Weinheim1999 Focus Review Similar temperatures of inactivation of chlorination were also observed in other experiments observing weathering ef-fects of plant material.[37] 2.3.2. Involvement of CPO in CHCl3 Production by Soils CPO activity has been detected in several spruce forest soil samples in crude extracts by using 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 3.6, containing 0.1 m KCl. Partial characterization of the de-tectable peroxidase showed activity only in the presence of hy-drogen peroxide, and a pH optimum of around 3\u20133.5.[20, 21] Fur-ther, storage at 23 8C resulted in complete inactivation within 4 days.[21] The pH optimum for chlorination by soil samples ex-posed to different pH values ranged from pH 2.5 to 4, with the highest activity observed in the surface organic layer.[21] There is general consensus that a heme CPO is involved in the formation of organochlorines in soils, and consequently, in the formation of CHCl3. [19a,b, 38] That heme CPO is responsible for the formation of naturally produced organochlorines, and consequently, the formation of CHCl3 has recently been chal-lenged.[28] On basis of the difference in chlorine isotope effects of organochlorines produced by CPO in vitro and those found in soils, it was concluded that this enzyme barely had any role in the production of soil organochlorines or that there were other chlorination pathways. By using the same technique, it was shown,[39] however, that the value of the chlorine isotope effect of chloroform formed by the CPO-catalyzed chlorination of humic acid was strongly affected by the experimental condi-tions used, for example, pH and the concentrations of Cl@ and hydrogen peroxide. These findings provide further support to the role of CPO in organochlorine formation in soils. However, it is very unlikely that the CPO from the Ascomycete C. fumago is solely responsible for this. Organohalogen production is a ubiquitous capacity among commonly occurring Basidiomy-cetous fungi.[39] Several ecologically significant strains of Basi-diomycetes were found to produce chlorinated anisyl deriva-tives when grown on natural lignocellulosic substrates. It can be hypothesized that the Basidiomycete Mycena metata and Peniophora pseudopini probably secrete CPOs based on the ob-servation that these fungi produce CHCl3 in the headspace of the pure cultures when grown on organic matter. However, these Basidiomycetes still only produce low levels of CHCl3. [40] As discussed in Section 2.4, to this end, vanadium CPOs may also play a significant role in CHCl3 production. In situ X-ray spectroscopy studies showed the formation of stable chlorinated hydrocarbons in soils, sediments, natural waters, and weathering plant material.[41] Interestingly, these chlorinated organic molecules have been found in humic sub-stances from various global sources; thus, their presence is in-dependent of geographic location.[41] Organochlorines are rap-idly formed in a process in which inorganic chloride (Cl@) is in-corporated into organic material, presumably through CPO ac-tivity. Surprisingly, these organochlorines are also found in de-grading senescent leaves still attached to the tree, which suggests that organochlorine formation in weathering plants is due to the action of airborne, external, terrestrial organisms producing CPO activity during the invasion of weathering plants. As far as it is known, endogenous plant peroxidases have no CPO activity (Section 2.3.4). Several studies already showed that exposure of humic substances to the CPO from C. fumago resulted in the chlorination of aromatic groups and the formation of chlorinated volatile compounds and chlorinat-ed acetic acids, of which the latter can decay to CHCl3. [38, 42, 43] In a more recent K-edge X-ray study,[37] the formation of these organohalogens was studied by using the CPO from the fungus C. fumago with the needles of redwood (Sequoia sem-pervirens) as a substrate. The organochlorines formed in this study closely resembled those found naturally in weathering needles of redwood; this adds weight to previous studies.[41] 2.3.3. Related Fungal Heme Peroxidases Distinct relatives of the heme CPO are aromatic peroxygenases (EC 1.11.2.1), also named unspecific oxygenases. They form a superfamily of heme thiolate peroxidases found in Basidio-mycetes. The enzyme from the fungus Agrocybe aegerita has structural similarities to that of the heme CPO, but very differ-ent catalytic properties. It is able to incorporate an oxygen atom from peroxide into various aromatic, heterocyclic, and ali-phatic compounds.[44a\u2013c] In contrast to the heme CPO, this per-oxygenase is only significantly able to oxidize bromide to HOBr, which leads to nonspecific bromination of com-pounds.[45] The chlorinating activity of this enzyme is very low,[44b] which is surprising because the high redox potential of the catalytic intermediate (compound I) of the peroxygenase[46] should facilitate oxidation of chloride to form HOCl. The relat-ed peroxygenase from the agaric fungus Marasmius rotula sim-ilarly displays almost no brominating activity,[47] which strongly suggests that these fungal heme thiolate peroxygenases have no capacity to form HOCl, leaving only the heme CPOs or other unidentified peroxidases as candidates involved in the formation of CHCl3 in soils and forest litter. Figure 2. Stability of heme CPO (&) and vanadium CPO (*). The heme CPO 2.3.4. Other Fungal Heme and Plant Peroxidases Possibly Involved in Halogenation This group of peroxidases is subdivided into three classes on the basis of sequence similarity.[48] Class I corresponds to a group of intracellular enzymes, for example, ascorbate perox-idase from plants. Class II is the secretory fungal peroxidases, for example, those secreted by white-rot Basidiomycetes re-sponsible for the degradation of lignocellulose. Under lignolyt-ic conditions, the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium secretes two types of extracellular heme peroxidases: lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase. These enzymes have an important role in the breakdown of plant biomass, but are not able to ox-idize chloride, although low brominating activity at pH 2 has been demonstrated.[49, 50] Class III contains the secretory plant peroxidases, such as those from horseradish or soybean, of which the soybean peroxidase shows a level of brominating activity.[51] Interestingly, it was reported that an acid phospha-tase from the embryonic axes of the plant Phaseolus vulgaris displayed CPO activity.[52a] However, this appears to be artificial CPO activity because the enzyme first had to be treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to remove metals and then the apoenzyme had to be incubated with vanadate. It was demonstrated earlier that the apo forms of bacterial acid phosphatases incubated with vanadate had haloperoxidase activity.[52b] 2.4. Vanadium Haloperoxidases in the Terrestrial Environment Many of the vanadium iodo-and bromoperoxidases found in the marine environment (macroalgae and cyanobacteria) are involved in the production of large amounts of brominated and iodinated compounds that are released into the atmos-phere.[1, 2, 53] Vanadium CPOs are also known and they are found in prokaryotes involved in the specific synthesis of chlorinated antibiotics and in a group of common terrestrial fungi, the de-matiaceous Hyphomycetes, belonging to the phylum Ascomy-cota. A bromoperoxidase is also present in the lichen Xantoria parietina, which grows on rocks and stones.[54] As discussed below, these fungal CPOs are involved in the decay of lignocel-lulose and plant debris, and may also play important roles in the formation of chlorinated compounds derived from soil or-ganic matter. Vanadium haloperoxidases differ significantly from the heme haloperoxidases.[55] They possess an oxidometa-late (vanadate) as a prosthetic group, which makes them very resistant towards oxidative inactivation. These enzymes, unlike classical heme peroxidases, are only able to oxidize halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to form hypohalous acids with pH optima tending towards physiological ranges found in soils. 2.4.1. Bacterial Vanadium-Dependent CPOs Recently, vanadium CPO-encoding genes were identified in a napyradiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from marine sedi-ment-derived Actinomycete Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525.[56a,b] The CPO involved has a very high selectivity and affinity for its substrate, a meroterpenoid, which is an intermediate in the synthesis of napyradiomycin antibiotics, and appears unable to form HOCl or chlorinate other compounds. Similarly, a vanadi-um-dependent CPO from the marine Streptomyces sp. CHN-189 was shown to catalyze the biosynthesis of the merochlorin meroterpenoid.[57a,b] This enzyme catalyzes site-selective naph-thol chlorination of the substrate pre-merochlorin and appears unable to chlorinate other substrate analogues or to form HOCl. These results suggest that terrestrial Streptomyces spe-cies only specifically chlorinate antibiotics and are not a source of CHCl3 found in soils. 2.4.2. Occurrence of Other Fungal Species with Haloperoxidase Activity About 30 years ago, a research group at the Cetus Cooperation made the important discovery that several pathogenic fungal species in the class of dematiaceous Hyphomycetes showed haloperoxidase activity.[58] This class belongs to the Deuteromy-cetes of fungi imperfecti, which is a provisional taxonomic group for which no sexual stage has been observed. Most Hy-phomycetes are now assigned to Ascomycetes on the basis of DNA analysis. They reproduce by sporulation in a process called sporogenesis. These fungal species were originally isolat-ed from soil samples, plants, and plant debris in Death Valley. This ecosystem was chosen on purpose because organisms growing in this habitat should be resistant towards extreme conditions and the enzymes present in these microorganisms may be more thermostable and show more alkaline pH optima, as required in some industrial applications. By using an assay based on the bromination of phenol red to bromo-phenol blue (Figure 3), several species (Cladosprium sp. , Embel-lisia alli, Ulocladium chartarum, Embellisia sp. , and Drechslera halodes) were shown to possess bromoperoxidase activity with pH optima above 3.0.[58] Shortly after, it was demonstrated that haloperoxidases iso-lated from the fungal species Curvularia inaequalis and Drech-slera sp. were able to produce HOCl at pH 5. These enzymes also demonstrated resistance towards high hydrogen peroxide concentrations and HOCl, unlike heme-containing haloperoxi-dases.[59] Interestingly, these CPOs were devoid of a heme group.[60] A more detailed study by using the monochlorodi-medone assay (Figure 1) showed that the genera Alternaria, Curvularia, Drechslera, Ulocladium, and Botrytis also produced Figure 3. Bromination of phenol red used to detect halogenating activity high levels of CPO activity.[61] Specifically, Alternaria alternata ; Curvularia cymbopogonis, C. inaequalis, C. tuberculata, C. verru-ciformis, and C. lunata; Dichotomophthora portulacae ; D. hal-odes and sp.; Ulocladium sp. ; Botrytis cinerea and sp. ; Humicola fuscoatra ; and E. alli. Some of these fungi were obtained from grapes (Botrytis), others from soil samples (Drechslera sp. from British Virgin Islands and New Jersey; Ulocladium sp. from South America and Death Valley). Hunter et al. also showed that moderate CPO levels were produced by Dendryphiella salina, Dendryphion nanum, U. chartarum, Bispora betulina, Stemphylium macrosporidium, Wardomyces anomalus, and Cla-dosporium sp.[61] 2.4.3. Fungal Vanadium CPOs in the Terrestrial Environment Van Schijndel et al. established that the CPO from C. inaequalis contained vanadium as a prosthetic group,[62] and that CPOs from Ulocaldium chartarum, Embellisia didymospora, Drechslera subpapendorfii, and B. cinerea were also vanadium enzymes.[63\u201365] From the data, it is fair to conclude that most, if not all, of the haloperoxidases found in the family genera of dematia-ceous Hyphomycetes produce CPO activity. Indeed, the peroxi-dases database[66] and our own BLAST search with the mRNA sequence of the vanadium CPO from C. inaequalis as a query (Figure 4) show that in the phylum Ascomycota many patho-genic fungal species are present that have mRNA sequences corresponding to the known sequence of vanadium from CPOs, for example, the rice blast fungus Magnaporte grisea, the fungal pathogen of wheat Phaeosphaeria nodorum, and the necrotrophic plant pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. These Hyphomycetes are very common and usually sapro-phytic in nature, and can be found on living plants or nonliv-ing organic matter. They constitute the predominant flora in terrestrial habitats and are isolated readily from leaf litter and differing soils types, for example, soils from the coastal areas of India,[67] salt marshes in Egypt,[68] and soils from Death Valley.[58] Furthermore, they may be present as pathogens that cause diseases in different host plants, typically agricultural crops,[69] and thus, represent a potential threat to food produc-tion. Examples include Alternaria, which causes a destructive foliar disease in potato and tomato plants,[69] and Curvularia species, which are facultative pathogens of plants and grasses.[69, 70] Most of these deuteromycetes rely upon conidia for reproduction spores that become airborne. In fact, Botrytis, Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Curvularia species are almost always present in air samples[71] and spores can be isolated from plant surfaces. Plants and leaf matter normally undergo seasonal decline to become moribund. It has been demon-strated that parasitic forms of the fungi can infect living grow-ing plants when spores land and germinate on a host plant.[72, 73] 2.4.4. Properties of Vanadium CPOs Many structural and kinetic data are available for these en-zymes.[55, 74\u201376] Figure 5 shows the structure of the active site and the cata-lytic mechanism of these enzymes. Compared with heme CPOs, these enzymes are highly stable and possess characteristics similar to those of enzymes from thermophiles. Their midpoint temperature is unusually high, as Figure 4. The BLAST tree output after performing a BLAST search with the mRNA of the vanadium CPO (ENA X85369.1) from C. inaequalis as an input se-illustrated in Figure 2. The midpoint temperatures of the CPOs from Curvularia inaeqalis[77] and Drechslera biseptata[63] are about 90 and 82 8C, respectively, and that of the related CPO from Embellisia didimospora[64] is about 65 8C. The thermostabil-ity of these enzymes is thus much higher than that of the heme CPO, which inactivates above 47 8C. The pH optimum of chlorinating activity is approximately pH 5.5, with an activity range from pH 4.5 to 7.[62, 63, 77] This pH optimum is higher than that of the heme enzyme, which is pH 3,[34] although the turn-over of about 20 s@1 is considerably lower than that of the heme CPO. The kinetic parameters for the vanadium CPO are noteworthy. In particular, the Km value for hydrogen peroxide of 5 mm at pH>5 (Figure 6) is unusually small.[62, 63] This means that the enzyme is functional at very low peroxide concentra-tions. Similarly, the Km value for chloride at pH 5 is 0.5 mm, which increases linearly with pH (Figure 6). These values are smaller than those reported for the heme CPO.[33] The pH optimum and the kinetic parameters show that these vanadium enzymes would certainly be active in soils or environments with neutral to slightly alkaline pH values. A study of topsoil pH of arctic and subarctic sites and ecosys-tems showed that there were large variations in pH between locations and within sampling sites.[14] In northern Sweden (subarctic forest soil), the mean pH value varies between 4.2 and 4.7. In Greenland, arctic and subarctic mean pH values are found between 5.6 and 6.7. Similarly, Redon et al. reported pH values in grassland water and arable land varying from 5.0 to 8.3, whereas those found in forests were typically lower.[12] Most lakes in Australia are pH-neutral to slightly alkaline[15] and sediments have been shown to release organochlorines, in-cluding CHCl3, in a biotic process. Many of these reported pH values are far above the optimum pH activity ranges of heme CPOs,[34] but certainly accommodate the activity range of vana-dium CPOs. In line with thermal stability, these enzymes are also resist-ant towards denaturation. In fact, they remain active in solu-tions containing 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate[62] and only become inactivated when these solutions are boiled. Similarly, they remain active when stored in organic solvents (solutions of 40 % methanol, ethanol, or 2-propanol) for 3 weeks,[77] and are very resistant towards oxidative inactivation by hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, or HOCl.[78, 79] However, these en-zymes are rapidly inactivated by phosphate, in particular, under mildly acidic pH values. This is probably due to an ex-change of vanadate in the active site for its structural ana-logue, phosphate. Therefore, in studies of these enzymes or in extraction of peroxidase activity from soil samples, the use of phosphate buffers should be avoided. The presence of low concentrations of peroxide completely prevented this inhibi-tion.[80] Because binding of vanadate requires no additional en-zymes or modifications to amino acid or metal groups, recon-stitution of activity of the apoenzyme can be simply carried out through the addition of 10 mm vanadate. This concentra-tion may seem high, but it is well documented that soils con-tain 100 ppm vanadium, which would correspond to approxi-mately 2 mm.[81] This is already sufficiently high to obtain a fully reconstituted enzyme in the in vivo situation. More im-portantly, the presence of hydrogen peroxide, even at low con-centrations, increases the affinity for vanadate considerably. This is due to the formation of pervanadate, which has a much higher affinity (<5 nm) for the enzyme than that of vanadate itself.[82] 3. Biological Function of Fungal Vanadium CPOs After germination of the conidia on or in their host, the fungal hyphae extend continuously at their extreme tips, from which enzymes are released into the environment to degrade the substrate polymers and allow penetration of the underlying surface (Figure 7). See ref. [83] , for further details on how pathogenic plant fungi penetrate plant leaves. From the tip extension, antibiotics or other inhibitors are re-leased subapically into the substrate erosion zone to prevent competing organisms from using the enzyme digestion prod-ucts. Experiments by Barnett and co-workers illustrated that CPO was also excreted by the growing hyphae of Curvularia in-equalis (Figure 8).[84, 85] Spores were inoculated on a nitrocellu-lose filter placed on top of nutrient agar, with a second em-bedded nitrocellulose filter on the bottom, and the fungal my-Figure 6. Log Km values for chloride and hydrogen peroxide as a function of celium was allowed to grow for 5 and 7 days, respectively.[85] After 5 days of incubation, CPO activity was only observed on the top filter. After 7 days, when the tips of the growing hyphen reached the embedded filter, CPO activity was also found on the embedded filter. This shows that the enzyme is secreted into the medium and found on the surface of the growing hyphal tips. This localization is substantiated by the finding that, after growing the fungus, treatment of the fungal mass with a low concentration of a detergent (0.05 % sodium dodecylsulfate) results in extraction of active CPO activity. The amount of CPO secreted by the growing fungus is substantial and constitutes approximately 60\u201370 % of total isolatable pro-tein.[84] In glucose-rich environments, when the enzyme is not needed, the transcription of vanadium CPO is toned down.[84] It is known that HOCl itself is a strong oxidizing agent able to disrupt and oxidize a diversity of structures. These observa-tions have led to the proposal that the function of the CPO is to oxidize the waxy protective cuticle layer on the leaves of the plant and degrade the cell walls of the host (plants) to fa-cilitate penetration of the fungus in the leaf cuticle and plant cell to reach nutrients in the cell.[84, 85] HOCl itself may have this role directly, but it is well documented that stressing plants, for example, by high-intensity light, damage, or pathogen attack, leads not only to the formation of hydrogen peroxide, but also to superoxide radicals.[86] HOCl may react with O2 @ or H2O2, according to Equations (2) and (3), respectively. [87] HOCl\u00fe O2@ ! OHC \u00fe Cl@ \u00fe O2 \u00f02\u00de HOCl\u00fe H2O2 ! 1O2 \u00fe Cl@ \u00fe H\u00fe \u00fe H20 \u00f03\u00de The hydroxyl radicals formed in Equation (2), together with singlet oxygen formed in Equation (3), may be more effective than HOCl alone. Figure 9 illustrates this proposal, as postulat-ed by Barnett.[85] It is expected that HOCl generated by these fungal species in the early stages of infection of plants or leaves will result in the formation of chlorinated intermediates. As illustrated by Leri and Myneni,[88] degradation of plant matter will probably continue, even after plant death, given the extreme stability of these vanadium CPOs. They showed that aromatic organo-chlorine species were detectable only in leachates from the first month of degradation, probably originating from senes-cent leaves in the forest ecosystem, consisting of oak, maple, and pine trees. Interestingly, these aromatic chlorine species are also produced in decaying plant litter by a process that de-pends on oxidized chlorine species produced by fungal CPOs. Aliphatic organochlorine species have also been observed in healthy leaves that then persist throughout senescence and humification and contribute to the pool of organochlorines in the soil.[88] These are superficial compounds that may originate from the cuticle, which forms a protective layer on the leaf sur-face. It is therefore tempting to speculate that these originate from early stages of infection by dematiaceous fungi. In line with this, studies making use of X-ray microscopy, combined with optical spectroscopy, showed that fungi played a role in the production of aromatic organochlorine species from natu-ral organochlorine formation in weathering plants.[89] In fact, in-oculation of healthy detached oak leaves with the pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum resulted in the formation of aromat-ic organochlorine species, as evidenced by Cl 1 s X-ray absorp-tion near-edge structure spectra. Unfortunately, the presence of CPO in Fusarium has not yet been shown. Only one research group has elaborated on the possible role of dematiaceous Hy-phomycetes in this process and the potential role of the vana-dium enzymes. Direct formation of halogenated metabolites by the plant pathogenic fungus C. inaeqalis has indeed been reported,[24] and it was shown that C. inaeqalis generated chlorinated aromates from lignin during its degradation of aspen wood, resulting in the production of 2-chlorolignine fragments (5-chlorovanillin and 2-chlorosyringaldehyde). Meta-genomic analysis of forest soil samples also shows the detecta-ble presence of genes corresponding to vanadium haloperoxi-dases.[23] Unfortunately, the source of these genes is not clear, although based on fungal presence, one would certainly expect the presence of vanadium CPOs. Figure 10 gives an overall picture of the chemical processes that occur after chlorination of organic matter by CPOs. In the reaction shown in Figure 10, a resorcinolic structure, which is a common struc-tural element in humic material, is chlorinated. After chlorina-tion of the aromatic ring, hydrolysis occurs and the formed product is further chlorinated and decays at pH values above 7 to form CHCl3, whereas trichloroacetic acid is produced at more acidic pH values.[8a,b] The formed CHCl3 is ventilated to the atmosphere and in the stratosphere chlorine radicals are formed through UV light-induced photolysis. This will result in ozone depletion by well-known reaction paths. 4. Summary and Outlook In forest soils, heme CPOs are present that produce HOCl, which leads indirectly, through the chlorination of natural or-ganic matter, to the formation of CHCl3. These forest soils are, in general, acidic in nature, fitting pH optima and other prop-erties of the enzyme activity isolated from soil samples. To date, the only heme CPO to have been well characterized is Figure 8. The agar plate system used to demonstrate the secretion of the that of the sooty mold C. fumago. This heme CPO has served as the model enzyme for several in-depth chlorination studies of plant matter and other organic matter naturally present in soils. The sooty molds are a cluster of species[90] that live on plant surfaces and unlike the Basidiomycetes they are not sus-tained in soils, but typically grow on fruits and leaves. There-fore, the role of Basidiomycetes in chlorination reactions in soils is not clear. However, considering the fact that these Basi-diomycetes produce large amounts of organochlorines, heme CPOs should be present. Many of the mostly pathogenic fungi that secrete CPO activ-ity are ubiquitously present in nature and, considering the spe-cial properties of the vanadium CPO, these enzymes will almost certainly play an important role in the formation of CHCl3. This occurs, in particular, in unforested areas, such as marshes, tundras, lakes, grassland, and agricultural soils, which, in general, have a more neutral to slightly alkaline pH value. The contribution of Hyphomycetes to the formation of CHCl3 in soils has been largely ignored. Furthermore, considering the unusual stability and their presumed longevity, these vanadi-um enzymes once formed inside or on the surface of the plant host will probably be found associated with degrading plant matter and in soils. Studies to establish their presence and di-versity in soils are essential. Another question that should be addressed is will the vanadium CPO survive in soils owing to the presence of phosphate? Soils indeed contain soluble or-thophosphate in amounts that vary with the type of soil and pH, and the presence of orthophosphate may lead to inactiva-tion of the VCPO. However, very low concentrations of hydro-gen peroxide prevent inactivation by phosphate.[80] Field ex-periments will give an answer. CHCl3 formed by the fungi is subsequently released into the atmosphere and, as a result of photolysis in the stratosphere, chlorine radicals will be formed that cause depletion of ozone. As such, fungi contribute to the global chlorine cycle, in which CPOs play a primary role in the formation of CHCl3, and thus, in the natural breakdown process of the earth\u2019s ozone layer. Natural breakdown of ozone also occurs owing to the activity of vanadium bromoperoxidases present in seaweed, phyto-plankton, and cyanobacteria. These organisms produce huge amounts of bromoform and other volatile brominated com-pounds that are ventilated to the atmosphere.[2a, 91] Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

        "Abstract: It is well established that the majority of chlorinat-ed organic substances found in the terrestrial environment are produced naturally. The presence of these compounds in soils is not limited to a single ecosystem. Natural chlorina-tion is also a widespread phenomenon in grasslands and ag-ricultural soils typical for unforested areas. These chlorinated compounds are formed from chlorination of natural organic matter consisting of very complex chemical structures, such as lignin. Chlorination of several lignin model compounds re-sults in the intermediate formation of trichloroacetyl-con-taining compounds, which are also found in soils. These decay, in general, through a haloform-type reaction mecha-nism to CHCl3. Upon release into the atmosphere, CHCl3 will produce chlorine radicals through photolysis, which will, in turn, lead to natural depletion of ozone. There is evidence that fungal chloroperoxidases able to produce HOCl are in-volved in the chlorination of natural organic matter. The ob-jective of this review is to clarify the role and source of the various chloroperoxidases involved in the natural formation of CHCl3.",
        "1. Introduction",
        "Both marine and terrestrial ecosystems produce and release halogenated compounds. Brominated compounds dominate the marine environment[1, 2a,b] and chlorinated organics are ma-jorly produced on land[3] by chlorination of natural organic matter. This substrate consists of complex chemical structures, such as lignin. Several studies set up to investigate chlorination of lignin by using 1,3-dihydroxy aromatic model compounds and humic acid revealed intermediate formation of several tri-chloroacetyl-containing compounds.[4, 5] These compounds, no-tably found in forest soils,[6] in general, decay to CHCl3 through a haloform-type reaction mechanism favored under slightly al-kaline conditions.[7] These data show that CHCl3 may be consid-ered as a natural compound in forest ecosystems.[8, 9] Chlorina-tion of dissolved organic material in freshwater by bleach also leads to the formation of CHCl3 and other volatile metabo-lites;[10, 11] a mechanism thus similar to natural chlorination. The presence of natural chlorinated organic compounds in soils and the formation of CHCl3 [8] is not limited to temperate forest ecosystems. An extensive study showed that natural chlorina-tion was widespread and included grasslands and agricultural soils typical of unforested areas.[12] Boreal forest soils also emit CHCl3 in similar amounts to that of more southern ecosys-tems.[13] Substantial emissions of CHCl3 have also been report-ed for tundra soil in Alaska,[14] hypersaline sediments,[15] and sediments from a moderately acidic salt lake.[16] In temperate conifer ecosystems, CHCl3 production is associated with micro-bial processes in the accumulated organic top layer of the soil.[17a\u2013d] Temperature sensitivity also indicates that chlorination in forest soils is a primarily biotic and enzymatic process. How-ever, abiotic chlorination may also occur, in which iron(III) in soils plays a catalytic role.[18] Although key enzyme systems and relevant microorganisms are yet to be fully identified,[19a,b] it is very likely, as discussed herein, that fungal chloroperoxi-dases (CPOs) able to oxidize chloride to hypochlorous acid are involved [Eq. (1)] .",

        "Most researchers in the field use the monochlorodimedone assay (Figure 1) to detect and quantify CPO activity.",
        "Indeed, CPO activity has been observed in several soil ex-tracts,[20, 21] with properties similar to those of the CPO from Caldariomyces fumago.[22] A metagenomic-based survey on soil samples from a German forest showed that species of organ-isms involved in microbial (de)halogenation were present.[23] Genes were detected in the soil samples that corresponded to heme-dependent and vanadium haloperoxidases. However, the origin of these genes was not further specified. The objective of this review is to pinpoint which enzymatic systems may be involved in the natural formation of CHCl3. The relevant prop-erties of these systems, with respect to formation of CHCl3, is discussed and, in particular, the potential role of vanadium CPOs is highlighted. With few exceptions, these vanadium CPOs have been largely ignored in the literature.[17b, 19, 24]",

        "2. Haloperoxidases and Halogenases",
        "2.1. Non-Heme Bacterial Haloperoxidases and Flavin-Dependent Halogenases Originally, bacterial perhydrolases found in bacteria such as Pseudomonas fluorescence were designated as CPOs. This bac-terial species produces the chlorinated antifungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin. These perhydrolases do not contain a heme group or metal ions.[25] Initially, it was assumed that such enzymes from these species were involved in substrate-/product-specific pathways. These and other bacterial non-heme non-metalloha-loperoxidases, in the presence of an organic acid and H2O2, catalyze unspecific halogenations by forming peroxyacid; a strong oxidizing agent that is able to directly oxidize halide ions to form hypohalous acid.[25] This reaction is, however, un-likely to occur under natural conditions because both a high concentration of the organic acid is required and millimolar-range concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. It is therefore im-portant to note that not all bacterial non-heme CPOs are real haloperoxidases. In this case, the activity, perhydrolysis, is more a quirk of nature than a means to an end. Unfortunately, there are still examples in the literature that define these perhydro-lases as CPOs. Unquestionably, there are a number of bacterial enzymes that are responsible for the formation of halogenated antibiotics, but these are typically dependent on flavin. These enzymes function through the intermediate formation of a flavin hydroperoxide formed by the reaction of oxygen, FADH2 (FAD = flavin adenine dinucleotide), and a halide ion. The subsequently formed hypohalous acid diffuses along the protein\u2019s channel to form a long-lived chlorinated intermedi-ate, which reacts with a specifically bound substrate.[26] HOCl does not leave the active site, which makes these substrate-specific, O2-dependent halogenases unlikely to be involved in the formation of CHCl3 in soils. In addition, the enzymatic activ-ity of these flavin-dependent halogenases is very low (turnover number 1\u20137 min@1).[27] This is in contrast to the study based on chlorine isotope effects by Aeppli et al. ,[28] who suggested some involvement of these flavin-dependent halogenases in the formation of organochlorines.",
        "2.2. Non-Heme Fe2 + Halogenases This highly homologous group of chlorinases from, for exam-ple, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, and Lyngbya species are in-volved in the biosynthesis of natural chlorinated products.[29a\u2013e] They share about 20\u201357 % sequence identity and use non-heme iron, O2, and 2-ketoglutarate to catalyze the chlorination of a-amino acids at aliphatic side-chain positions. To function as a substrate, the amino acid must be linked as a thioester to a phosphopantetheine tether. The reaction mechanism in-volves a haloferryl species that cleaves aliphatic C@H bonds in the bound substrate, which results in the formation of halo-genated intermediates. Recently, an iron-dependent halogen-ase was discovered in cyanobacteria that was able to chlori-nate stereospecifically a free-standing Fischer indole.[29f] Again, this is a group of enzymes that has a very specific binding site for their substrates and it is not probable that other substrates are chlorinated.",
        "Thus, free and diffusible HOCl is not formed and it is unlikely that these enzymes are a source of CHCl3.",
        "2.3. Heme-Containing Haloperoxidases 2.3.1. Heme-Containing CPOs The classical representative of this class of enzymes is the heme-containing CPO from the filamentous fungus C. fumago discovered in 1959.[30] This fungus from the class of Ascomy-cetes produces caldariomycin; a cyclopentane derivative con-taining two chlorine atoms.[31] This enzyme belongs to the heme thiolate peroxidases and is well characterized.[32\u201334] It has been extensively studied for its synthetic applications because its peroxygenase activity allows hydroxylation of C@H bonds (benzylic hydroxylation), epoxidation of double bonds, and sul-foxidation. Although easily inactivated by the substrate, hydro-gen peroxide, and its product, HOCl, the enzyme is popular for chlorination studies owing to its commercial availability and in-itial high turnover (1000 s@1).[34] The low optimum pH (around 3.0) of the enzyme for chloride oxidation by hydrogen perox-ide[34] displays a Km for hydrogen peroxide of around 0.2 mm and for chloride of around 5 mm.[31, 34] HOCl or HOBr formed has been postulated to be released and could thus nonspecifi-cally halogenate organic compounds.[35] As shown in Figure 2, this CPO is readily inactivated above 50 8C. Also, storage at slightly elevated temperatures leads to rapid inactivation.[36]",
        "Ron Wever is Professor in Biocatalysis at the University of Amsterdam, from which he re-tired in 2012. His research was focused on metalloproteins and their reactions with oxygen or oxygen derivatives. His group dis-covered a new class of enzymes, the vanadi-um haloperoxidases, in which vanadium is the prosthetic group. In 2016, he received the Vanadis Award for his ongoing contributions in elucidating the structure and function of these enzymes. His latest research activities also dealt with enzymes able to phosphory-late or sulfate compounds, with the aim of re-placing chemical synthesis methods by more cleaner biocatalytic procedures. Phil Barnett works as Assistant Professor in the Department of Anatomy, Embryology and Physiology at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. He trained as a Ph.D. student in biochemistry under Ron Wever, focusing on protein structure and function of vanadium haloperoxidases (1997). After a post-doctoral position of three years studying peroxisomal protein import, he switched his research focus to another area of interest, namely, mammali-an gene regulation and disease. His current research is set around trying to understand human genetic variation and its influence on transcriptional responses and conduction dis-eases of the heart.",

        "Similar temperatures of inactivation of chlorination were also observed in other experiments observing weathering ef-fects of plant material.[37]",
        "2.3.2. Involvement of CPO in CHCl3 Production by Soils CPO activity has been detected in several spruce forest soil samples in crude extracts by using 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 3.6, containing 0.1 m KCl. Partial characterization of the de-tectable peroxidase showed activity only in the presence of hy-drogen peroxide, and a pH optimum of around 3\u20133.5.[20, 21] Fur-ther, storage at 23 8C resulted in complete inactivation within 4 days.[21] The pH optimum for chlorination by soil samples ex-posed to different pH values ranged from pH 2.5 to 4, with the highest activity observed in the surface organic layer.[21]",
        "There is general consensus that a heme CPO is involved in the formation of organochlorines in soils, and consequently, in the formation of CHCl3. [19a,b, 38] That heme CPO is responsible for the formation of naturally produced organochlorines, and consequently, the formation of CHCl3 has recently been chal-lenged.[28] On basis of the difference in chlorine isotope effects of organochlorines produced by CPO in vitro and those found in soils, it was concluded that this enzyme barely had any role in the production of soil organochlorines or that there were other chlorination pathways. By using the same technique, it was shown,[39] however, that the value of the chlorine isotope effect of chloroform formed by the CPO-catalyzed chlorination of humic acid was strongly affected by the experimental condi-tions used, for example, pH and the concentrations of Cl@ and hydrogen peroxide. These findings provide further support to the role of CPO in organochlorine formation in soils. However, it is very unlikely that the CPO from the Ascomycete C. fumago is solely responsible for this. Organohalogen production is a ubiquitous capacity among commonly occurring Basidiomy-cetous fungi.[39] Several ecologically significant strains of Basi-diomycetes were found to produce chlorinated anisyl deriva-tives when grown on natural lignocellulosic substrates. It can be hypothesized that the Basidiomycete Mycena metata and Peniophora pseudopini probably secrete CPOs based on the ob-servation that these fungi produce CHCl3 in the headspace of the pure cultures when grown on organic matter. However, these Basidiomycetes still only produce low levels of CHCl3. [40] As discussed in Section 2.4, to this end, vanadium CPOs may also play a significant role in CHCl3 production.",
        "In situ X-ray spectroscopy studies showed the formation of stable chlorinated hydrocarbons in soils, sediments, natural waters, and weathering plant material.[41] Interestingly, these chlorinated organic molecules have been found in humic sub-stances from various global sources; thus, their presence is in-dependent of geographic location.[41] Organochlorines are rap-idly formed in a process in which inorganic chloride (Cl@) is in-corporated into organic material, presumably through CPO ac-tivity. Surprisingly, these organochlorines are also found in de-grading senescent leaves still attached to the tree, which suggests that organochlorine formation in weathering plants is due to the action of airborne, external, terrestrial organisms producing CPO activity during the invasion of weathering plants. As far as it is known, endogenous plant peroxidases have no CPO activity (Section 2.3.4). Several studies already showed that exposure of humic substances to the CPO from C. fumago resulted in the chlorination of aromatic groups and the formation of chlorinated volatile compounds and chlorinat-ed acetic acids, of which the latter can decay to CHCl3. [38, 42, 43] In a more recent K-edge X-ray study,[37] the formation of these organohalogens was studied by using the CPO from the fungus C. fumago with the needles of redwood (Sequoia sem-pervirens) as a substrate. The organochlorines formed in this study closely resembled those found naturally in weathering needles of redwood; this adds weight to previous studies.[41]",
        "2.3.3. Related Fungal Heme Peroxidases Distinct relatives of the heme CPO are aromatic peroxygenases (EC 1.11.2.1), also named unspecific oxygenases. They form a superfamily of heme thiolate peroxidases found in Basidio-mycetes. The enzyme from the fungus Agrocybe aegerita has structural similarities to that of the heme CPO, but very differ-ent catalytic properties. It is able to incorporate an oxygen atom from peroxide into various aromatic, heterocyclic, and ali-phatic compounds.[44a\u2013c] In contrast to the heme CPO, this per-oxygenase is only significantly able to oxidize bromide to HOBr, which leads to nonspecific bromination of com-pounds.[45] The chlorinating activity of this enzyme is very low,[44b] which is surprising because the high redox potential of the catalytic intermediate (compound I) of the peroxygenase[46] should facilitate oxidation of chloride to form HOCl. The relat-ed peroxygenase from the agaric fungus Marasmius rotula sim-ilarly displays almost no brominating activity,[47] which strongly suggests that these fungal heme thiolate peroxygenases have no capacity to form HOCl, leaving only the heme CPOs or other unidentified peroxidases as candidates involved in the formation of CHCl3 in soils and forest litter.",

        "This group of peroxidases is subdivided into three classes on the basis of sequence similarity.[48] Class I corresponds to a group of intracellular enzymes, for example, ascorbate perox-idase from plants. Class II is the secretory fungal peroxidases, for example, those secreted by white-rot Basidiomycetes re-sponsible for the degradation of lignocellulose. Under lignolyt-ic conditions, the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium secretes two types of extracellular heme peroxidases: lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase. These enzymes have an important role in the breakdown of plant biomass, but are not able to ox-idize chloride, although low brominating activity at pH 2 has been demonstrated.[49, 50] Class III contains the secretory plant peroxidases, such as those from horseradish or soybean, of which the soybean peroxidase shows a level of brominating activity.[51] Interestingly, it was reported that an acid phospha-tase from the embryonic axes of the plant Phaseolus vulgaris displayed CPO activity.[52a] However, this appears to be artificial CPO activity because the enzyme first had to be treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to remove metals and then the apoenzyme had to be incubated with vanadate. It was demonstrated earlier that the apo forms of bacterial acid phosphatases incubated with vanadate had haloperoxidase activity.[52b]",
        "2.4. Vanadium Haloperoxidases in the Terrestrial Environment Many of the vanadium iodo-and bromoperoxidases found in the marine environment (macroalgae and cyanobacteria) are involved in the production of large amounts of brominated and iodinated compounds that are released into the atmos-phere.[1, 2, 53] Vanadium CPOs are also known and they are found in prokaryotes involved in the specific synthesis of chlorinated antibiotics and in a group of common terrestrial fungi, the de-matiaceous Hyphomycetes, belonging to the phylum Ascomy-cota. A bromoperoxidase is also present in the lichen Xantoria parietina, which grows on rocks and stones.[54] As discussed below, these fungal CPOs are involved in the decay of lignocel-lulose and plant debris, and may also play important roles in the formation of chlorinated compounds derived from soil or-ganic matter. Vanadium haloperoxidases differ significantly from the heme haloperoxidases.[55] They possess an oxidometa-late (vanadate) as a prosthetic group, which makes them very resistant towards oxidative inactivation. These enzymes, unlike classical heme peroxidases, are only able to oxidize halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to form hypohalous acids with pH optima tending towards physiological ranges found in soils.",
        "2.4.1. Bacterial Vanadium-Dependent CPOs Recently, vanadium CPO-encoding genes were identified in a napyradiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from marine sedi-ment-derived Actinomycete Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525.[56a,b] The CPO involved has a very high selectivity and affinity for its substrate, a meroterpenoid, which is an intermediate in the synthesis of napyradiomycin antibiotics, and appears unable to form HOCl or chlorinate other compounds. Similarly, a vanadi-um-dependent CPO from the marine Streptomyces sp. CHN-189 was shown to catalyze the biosynthesis of the merochlorin meroterpenoid.[57a,b] This enzyme catalyzes site-selective naph-thol chlorination of the substrate pre-merochlorin and appears unable to chlorinate other substrate analogues or to form HOCl. These results suggest that terrestrial Streptomyces spe-cies only specifically chlorinate antibiotics and are not a source of CHCl3 found in soils.",
        "2.4.2. Occurrence of Other Fungal Species with Haloperoxidase Activity About 30 years ago, a research group at the Cetus Cooperation made the important discovery that several pathogenic fungal species in the class of dematiaceous Hyphomycetes showed haloperoxidase activity.[58] This class belongs to the Deuteromy-cetes of fungi imperfecti, which is a provisional taxonomic group for which no sexual stage has been observed. Most Hy-phomycetes are now assigned to Ascomycetes on the basis of DNA analysis. They reproduce by sporulation in a process called sporogenesis. These fungal species were originally isolat-ed from soil samples, plants, and plant debris in Death Valley. This ecosystem was chosen on purpose because organisms growing in this habitat should be resistant towards extreme conditions and the enzymes present in these microorganisms may be more thermostable and show more alkaline pH optima, as required in some industrial applications. By using an assay based on the bromination of phenol red to bromo-phenol blue (Figure 3), several species (Cladosprium sp. , Embel-lisia alli, Ulocladium chartarum, Embellisia sp. , and Drechslera halodes) were shown to possess bromoperoxidase activity with pH optima above 3.0.[58]",
        "Shortly after, it was demonstrated that haloperoxidases iso-lated from the fungal species Curvularia inaequalis and Drech-slera sp. were able to produce HOCl at pH 5. These enzymes also demonstrated resistance towards high hydrogen peroxide concentrations and HOCl, unlike heme-containing haloperoxi-dases.[59] Interestingly, these CPOs were devoid of a heme group.[60] A more detailed study by using the monochlorodi-medone assay (Figure 1) showed that the genera Alternaria, Curvularia, Drechslera, Ulocladium, and Botrytis also produced",
        "Figure 3. Bromination of phenol red used to detect halogenating activity",
        "high levels of CPO activity.[61] Specifically, Alternaria alternata ; Curvularia cymbopogonis, C. inaequalis, C. tuberculata, C. verru-ciformis, and C. lunata; Dichotomophthora portulacae ; D. hal-odes and sp.; Ulocladium sp. ; Botrytis cinerea and sp. ; Humicola fuscoatra ; and E. alli. Some of these fungi were obtained from grapes (Botrytis), others from soil samples (Drechslera sp. from British Virgin Islands and New Jersey; Ulocladium sp. from South America and Death Valley). Hunter et al. also showed that moderate CPO levels were produced by Dendryphiella salina, Dendryphion nanum, U. chartarum, Bispora betulina, Stemphylium macrosporidium, Wardomyces anomalus, and Cla-dosporium sp.[61]",
        "2.4.3. Fungal Vanadium CPOs in the Terrestrial Environment Van Schijndel et al. established that the CPO from C. inaequalis contained vanadium as a prosthetic group,[62] and that CPOs from Ulocaldium chartarum, Embellisia didymospora, Drechslera subpapendorfii, and B. cinerea were also vanadium enzymes.[63\u201365]",
        "From the data, it is fair to conclude that most, if not all, of the haloperoxidases found in the family genera of dematia-ceous Hyphomycetes produce CPO activity. Indeed, the peroxi-dases database[66] and our own BLAST search with the mRNA sequence of the vanadium CPO from C. inaequalis as a query (Figure 4) show that in the phylum Ascomycota many patho-genic fungal species are present that have mRNA sequences corresponding to the known sequence of vanadium from CPOs, for example, the rice blast fungus Magnaporte grisea, the fungal pathogen of wheat Phaeosphaeria nodorum, and the necrotrophic plant pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis.",
        "These Hyphomycetes are very common and usually sapro-phytic in nature, and can be found on living plants or nonliv-ing organic matter. They constitute the predominant flora in terrestrial habitats and are isolated readily from leaf litter and differing soils types, for example, soils from the coastal areas of India,[67] salt marshes in Egypt,[68] and soils from Death Valley.[58] Furthermore, they may be present as pathogens that cause diseases in different host plants, typically agricultural crops,[69] and thus, represent a potential threat to food produc-tion. Examples include Alternaria, which causes a destructive foliar disease in potato and tomato plants,[69] and Curvularia species, which are facultative pathogens of plants and grasses.[69, 70] Most of these deuteromycetes rely upon conidia for reproduction spores that become airborne. In fact, Botrytis, Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Curvularia species are almost always present in air samples[71] and spores can be isolated from plant surfaces. Plants and leaf matter normally undergo seasonal decline to become moribund. It has been demon-strated that parasitic forms of the fungi can infect living grow-ing plants when spores land and germinate on a host plant.[72, 73]",
        "2.4.4. Properties of Vanadium CPOs Many structural and kinetic data are available for these en-zymes.[55, 74\u201376]",
        "Figure 5 shows the structure of the active site and the cata-lytic mechanism of these enzymes.",
        "Compared with heme CPOs, these enzymes are highly stable and possess characteristics similar to those of enzymes from thermophiles. Their midpoint temperature is unusually high, as",
        "Figure 4. The BLAST tree output after performing a BLAST search with the mRNA of the vanadium CPO (ENA X85369.1) from C. inaequalis as an input se-",
        "illustrated in Figure 2. The midpoint temperatures of the CPOs from Curvularia inaeqalis[77] and Drechslera biseptata[63] are about 90 and 82 8C, respectively, and that of the related CPO from Embellisia didimospora[64] is about 65 8C. The thermostabil-ity of these enzymes is thus much higher than that of the heme CPO, which inactivates above 47 8C. The pH optimum of chlorinating activity is approximately pH 5.5, with an activity range from pH 4.5 to 7.[62, 63, 77] This pH optimum is higher than that of the heme enzyme, which is pH 3,[34] although the turn-over of about 20 s@1 is considerably lower than that of the heme CPO. The kinetic parameters for the vanadium CPO are noteworthy. In particular, the Km value for hydrogen peroxide of 5 mm at pH>5 (Figure 6) is unusually small.[62, 63] This means that the enzyme is functional at very low peroxide concentra-tions. Similarly, the Km value for chloride at pH 5 is 0.5 mm, which increases linearly with pH (Figure 6).",
        "These values are smaller than those reported for the heme CPO.[33] The pH optimum and the kinetic parameters show that these vanadium enzymes would certainly be active in soils or environments with neutral to slightly alkaline pH values. A study of topsoil pH of arctic and subarctic sites and ecosys-tems showed that there were large variations in pH between locations and within sampling sites.[14] In northern Sweden (subarctic forest soil), the mean pH value varies between 4.2 and 4.7. In Greenland, arctic and subarctic mean pH values are found between 5.6 and 6.7. Similarly, Redon et al. reported pH values in grassland water and arable land varying from 5.0 to 8.3, whereas those found in forests were typically lower.[12] Most lakes in Australia are pH-neutral to slightly alkaline[15] and sediments have been shown to release organochlorines, in-cluding CHCl3, in a biotic process. Many of these reported pH values are far above the optimum pH activity ranges of heme CPOs,[34] but certainly accommodate the activity range of vana-dium CPOs.",
        "In line with thermal stability, these enzymes are also resist-ant towards denaturation. In fact, they remain active in solu-tions containing 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate[62] and only become inactivated when these solutions are boiled. Similarly, they remain active when stored in organic solvents (solutions of 40 % methanol, ethanol, or 2-propanol) for 3 weeks,[77] and are very resistant towards oxidative inactivation by hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, or HOCl.[78, 79] However, these en-zymes are rapidly inactivated by phosphate, in particular, under mildly acidic pH values. This is probably due to an ex-change of vanadate in the active site for its structural ana-logue, phosphate. Therefore, in studies of these enzymes or in extraction of peroxidase activity from soil samples, the use of phosphate buffers should be avoided. The presence of low concentrations of peroxide completely prevented this inhibi-tion.[80] Because binding of vanadate requires no additional en-zymes or modifications to amino acid or metal groups, recon-stitution of activity of the apoenzyme can be simply carried out through the addition of 10 mm vanadate. This concentra-tion may seem high, but it is well documented that soils con-tain 100 ppm vanadium, which would correspond to approxi-mately 2 mm.[81] This is already sufficiently high to obtain a fully reconstituted enzyme in the in vivo situation. More im-portantly, the presence of hydrogen peroxide, even at low con-centrations, increases the affinity for vanadate considerably. This is due to the formation of pervanadate, which has a much higher affinity (<5 nm) for the enzyme than that of vanadate itself.[82]",
        "3. Biological Function of Fungal Vanadium CPOs After germination of the conidia on or in their host, the fungal hyphae extend continuously at their extreme tips, from which enzymes are released into the environment to degrade the substrate polymers and allow penetration of the underlying surface (Figure 7). See ref. [83] , for further details on how",
        "pathogenic plant fungi penetrate plant leaves.",
        "From the tip extension, antibiotics or other inhibitors are re-leased subapically into the substrate erosion zone to prevent competing organisms from using the enzyme digestion prod-ucts. Experiments by Barnett and co-workers illustrated that CPO was also excreted by the growing hyphae of Curvularia in-equalis (Figure 8).[84, 85] Spores were inoculated on a nitrocellu-lose filter placed on top of nutrient agar, with a second em-bedded nitrocellulose filter on the bottom, and the fungal my-",

        "celium was allowed to grow for 5 and 7 days, respectively.[85] After 5 days of incubation, CPO activity was only observed on the top filter. After 7 days, when the tips of the growing hyphen reached the embedded filter, CPO activity was also found on the embedded filter. This shows that the enzyme is secreted into the medium and found on the surface of the growing hyphal tips. This localization is substantiated by the finding that, after growing the fungus, treatment of the fungal mass with a low concentration of a detergent (0.05 % sodium dodecylsulfate) results in extraction of active CPO activity. The amount of CPO secreted by the growing fungus is substantial and constitutes approximately 60\u201370 % of total isolatable pro-tein.[84] In glucose-rich environments, when the enzyme is not needed, the transcription of vanadium CPO is toned down.[84]",
        "It is known that HOCl itself is a strong oxidizing agent able to disrupt and oxidize a diversity of structures. These observa-tions have led to the proposal that the function of the CPO is to oxidize the waxy protective cuticle layer on the leaves of the plant and degrade the cell walls of the host (plants) to fa-cilitate penetration of the fungus in the leaf cuticle and plant cell to reach nutrients in the cell.[84, 85] HOCl itself may have this role directly, but it is well documented that stressing plants, for example, by high-intensity light, damage, or pathogen attack, leads not only to the formation of hydrogen peroxide, but also to superoxide radicals.[86] HOCl may react with O2 @ or H2O2, according to Equations (2) and (3), respectively. [87]",

        "The hydroxyl radicals formed in Equation (2), together with singlet oxygen formed in Equation (3), may be more effective than HOCl alone. Figure 9 illustrates this proposal, as postulat-ed by Barnett.[85]",
        "It is expected that HOCl generated by these fungal species in the early stages of infection of plants or leaves will result in the formation of chlorinated intermediates. As illustrated by Leri and Myneni,[88] degradation of plant matter will probably continue, even after plant death, given the extreme stability of these vanadium CPOs. They showed that aromatic organo-chlorine species were detectable only in leachates from the first month of degradation, probably originating from senes-cent leaves in the forest ecosystem, consisting of oak, maple, and pine trees. Interestingly, these aromatic chlorine species are also produced in decaying plant litter by a process that de-pends on oxidized chlorine species produced by fungal CPOs. Aliphatic organochlorine species have also been observed in healthy leaves that then persist throughout senescence and humification and contribute to the pool of organochlorines in the soil.[88] These are superficial compounds that may originate from the cuticle, which forms a protective layer on the leaf sur-face. It is therefore tempting to speculate that these originate from early stages of infection by dematiaceous fungi. In line with this, studies making use of X-ray microscopy, combined with optical spectroscopy, showed that fungi played a role in the production of aromatic organochlorine species from natu-ral organochlorine formation in weathering plants.[89] In fact, in-oculation of healthy detached oak leaves with the pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum resulted in the formation of aromat-ic organochlorine species, as evidenced by Cl 1 s X-ray absorp-tion near-edge structure spectra. Unfortunately, the presence of CPO in Fusarium has not yet been shown. Only one research group has elaborated on the possible role of dematiaceous Hy-phomycetes in this process and the potential role of the vana-dium enzymes. Direct formation of halogenated metabolites by the plant pathogenic fungus C. inaeqalis has indeed been reported,[24] and it was shown that C. inaeqalis generated chlorinated aromates from lignin during its degradation of aspen wood, resulting in the production of 2-chlorolignine fragments (5-chlorovanillin and 2-chlorosyringaldehyde). Meta-genomic analysis of forest soil samples also shows the detecta-ble presence of genes corresponding to vanadium haloperoxi-dases.[23] Unfortunately, the source of these genes is not clear, although based on fungal presence, one would certainly expect the presence of vanadium CPOs. Figure 10 gives an overall picture of the chemical processes that occur after chlorination of organic matter by CPOs. In the reaction shown in Figure 10, a resorcinolic structure, which is a common struc-tural element in humic material, is chlorinated. After chlorina-tion of the aromatic ring, hydrolysis occurs and the formed product is further chlorinated and decays at pH values above 7 to form CHCl3, whereas trichloroacetic acid is produced at more acidic pH values.[8a,b] The formed CHCl3 is ventilated to the atmosphere and in the stratosphere chlorine radicals are formed through UV light-induced photolysis. This will result in ozone depletion by well-known reaction paths.",
        "4. Summary and Outlook In forest soils, heme CPOs are present that produce HOCl, which leads indirectly, through the chlorination of natural or-ganic matter, to the formation of CHCl3. These forest soils are, in general, acidic in nature, fitting pH optima and other prop-erties of the enzyme activity isolated from soil samples. To date, the only heme CPO to have been well characterized is",
        "Figure 8. The agar plate system used to demonstrate the secretion of the",
        "that of the sooty mold C. fumago. This heme CPO has served as the model enzyme for several in-depth chlorination studies of plant matter and other organic matter naturally present in soils. The sooty molds are a cluster of species[90] that live on plant surfaces and unlike the Basidiomycetes they are not sus-tained in soils, but typically grow on fruits and leaves. There-fore, the role of Basidiomycetes in chlorination reactions in soils is not clear. However, considering the fact that these Basi-diomycetes produce large amounts of organochlorines, heme CPOs should be present.",
        "Many of the mostly pathogenic fungi that secrete CPO activ-ity are ubiquitously present in nature and, considering the spe-cial properties of the vanadium CPO, these enzymes will almost certainly play an important role in the formation of CHCl3. This occurs, in particular, in unforested areas, such as marshes, tundras, lakes, grassland, and agricultural soils, which, in general, have a more neutral to slightly alkaline pH value. The contribution of Hyphomycetes to the formation of CHCl3 in soils has been largely ignored. Furthermore, considering the unusual stability and their presumed longevity, these vanadi-um enzymes once formed inside or on the surface of the plant host will probably be found associated with degrading plant matter and in soils. Studies to establish their presence and di-versity in soils are essential. Another question that should be addressed is will the vanadium CPO survive in soils owing to the presence of phosphate? Soils indeed contain soluble or-thophosphate in amounts that vary with the type of soil and pH, and the presence of orthophosphate may lead to inactiva-tion of the VCPO. However, very low concentrations of hydro-gen peroxide prevent inactivation by phosphate.[80] Field ex-periments will give an answer.",
        "CHCl3 formed by the fungi is subsequently released into the atmosphere and, as a result of photolysis in the stratosphere, chlorine radicals will be formed that cause depletion of ozone. As such, fungi contribute to the global chlorine cycle, in which CPOs play a primary role in the formation of CHCl3, and thus, in the natural breakdown process of the earth\u2019s ozone layer. Natural breakdown of ozone also occurs owing to the activity of vanadium bromoperoxidases present in seaweed, phyto-plankton, and cyanobacteria. These organisms produce huge amounts of bromoform and other volatile brominated com-pounds that are ventilated to the atmosphere.[2a, 91]",
