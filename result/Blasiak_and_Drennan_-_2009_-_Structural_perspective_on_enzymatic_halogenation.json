DRENNAN*,\u2020,\u2021 \u2020Departments of Chemistry, \u2021Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 RECEIVED ON MARCH 17, 2008 C O N S P E C T U S Simple halogen substituents frequently afford key structural features that account for the potency and selectivity of nat-ural products, including antibiotics and hormones. For example, when a single chlorine atom on the antibiotic vanco-mycin is replaced by hydrogen, the resulting antibacterial activity decreases by up to 70% (Harris, C. M.; Kannan, R.; Kopecka, H.; Harris, T. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 6652-6658). This Account analyzes how structure underlies mechanism in halogenases, the molecular machines designed by nature to incorporate halogens into diverse substrates. Traditional synthetic methods of integrating halogens into complex molecules are often complicated by a lack of spec-ificity and regioselectivity. Nature, however, has developed a variety of elegant mechanisms for halogenating specific sub-strates with both regio-and stereoselectivity. An improved understanding of the biological routes toward halogenation could lead to the development of novel synthetic methods for the creation of new compounds with enhanced functions. Already, researchers have co-opted a fluorinase from the microorganism Streptomyces cattleya to produce 18F-labeled molecules for use in positron emission tomography (PET) (Deng, H.; Cobb, S. L.; Gee, A. D.; Lockhart, A.; Martarello, L.; McGlinchey, R. P.; O\u2019Hagan, D.; Onega, M. Chem. Commun. 2006, 652-654). Therefore, the discovery and characterization of naturally occur-ring enzymatic halogenation mechanisms has become an active area of research. The catalogue of known halogenating enzymes has expanded from the familiar haloperoxidases to include oxygen-dependent enzymes and fluorinases. Recently, the discovery of a nucleophilic halogenase that catalyzes chlorinations has expanded the repertoire of biological halogenation chemistry (Dong, C.; Huang, F.; Deng, H.; Schaffrath, C.; Spencer, J. B.; O\u2019Hagan, D.; Naismith, J. H. Nature 2004, 427, 561-565). Structural characterization has provided a basis toward a mech-anistic understanding of the specificity and chemistry of these enzymes. In particular, the latest crystallographic snapshots of active site architecture and halide binding sites have provided key insights into enzyme catalysis. Herein is a summary of the five classes of halogenases, focusing on the three most recently discovered: flavin-depend-ent halogenases, non-heme iron-dependent halogenases, and nucleophilic halogenases. Further, the potential roles of halide-binding sites in determining halide selectivity are discussed, as well as whether or not binding-site composition is always a seminal factor for selectivity. Expanding our understanding of the basic chemical principles that dictate the activity of the halogenases will advance both biology and chemistry. A thorough mechanistic analysis will elucidate the biological princi-ples that dictate specificity, and the application of those principles to new synthetic techniques will expand the utility of halo-genations in small-molecule development.

Here we examine questions of halogenation reactivity and specificity from the primary per-spective of enzyme structure, focusing on the recent struc-tures of flavin-dependent, non-heme iron-dependent, and nucleophilic halogenases. Proposed general mechanistic strat-egies and substrate requirements of each class are shown in Table 1. Additionally, there are other enzymes with known peroxo intermediate, which is vulnerable to attack by a halide ion. As with the heme-dependent enzymes, there is still some disagreement over the nature of the halogenating species, in particular, whether the substrate reacts predominantly with free hypohalous acid or with some form of enzyme bound V-OX intermediate.20,21 Experimental evidence suggests that these enzymes can perform certain reactions with regioselec-tivity or enantioselectivity supporting reaction with a \u201ctrapped\u201d X+ equivalent,23,24 while in other cases no selectivity is observed.20 Indeed, the Ascophyllum nodosum enzyme is puri-fied with a halogen-modified surface tryptophan, which could result from free diffusion of an enzyme self-generated X+ equivalent.25 Drawing conclusions is further complicated by the fact that the exact physiological roles and substrates of most vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases are unknown. Thus, enzyme activity is often assayed with a generic monochlorodimedone (MCD) substrate (Scheme 1B). The dis-covery of three vanadium haloperoxidase genes within a nat-ural product gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 presents an exciting opportunity to characterize haloperoxi-dases with their physiological substrates.22 The first crystal structure of a vanadium-dependent halop-eroxidase was solved for the chloroperoxidase (V-CPO) from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis (Figure 1B).26 The vanadate binding site sits at the bottom of a \u223c10 \u00c5 solvent-accessible channel. More recently, highly homologous structures of three algal bromoperoxidases (V-BPOs) were completed from Ascophyllum nodosum, Corallina officinalis, and Corallina pilulifera.20,21 FADH2 and O2-Dependent Halogenases. Many flavin-dependent halogenases have now been characterized, and they can be divided into two main groups: those that cata-lyze chlorination on free small-molecule substrates (RebH, PrnA)27-30 and those that react with substrates tethered to a thiolation domain in a nonribosomal polypeptide synthetase (NRPS) system (PltA, SgcC3).1,4 To date, the structures of only two confirmed flavin-dependent halogenases have been solved, PrnA from Pseudomonas fluorescens30 and RebH from TABLE 1. The Five Classes of Halogenating Enzymes Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes,29,31 and both enzymes cata-lyze the chlorination of the free amino acid L-tryptophan on C7 (Scheme 1C). Flavin-dependent halogenases require reduced flavin (FADH2), which is provided by a partner-protein reductase (NADH-dependent RebF for RebH). There is clear spectroscopic evidence for reaction of FADH2 with dioxygen to form a FAD-C4a-OOH intermediate,28 which could react with Cl-to pro-duce hypochlorous acid (HOCl). In the most recently proposed mechanism, HOCl then covalently modifies a protein residue (Lys79 in RebH and PrnA) that in turn acts as the direct chlo-rinating agent.29 This hypothesis is supported by the observed regioselectivity and the identification of a long-lived, kineti-cally competent chlorinating intermediate, as well as by struc-tural analysis.29 Flavin-dependent halogenases employ an oxidative strategy of chlorination (with formation of a Cl+ equivalent) similar to haloperoxidases and require an electron-rich substrate, although the route through a covalent protein intermediate adds the benefit of regioselectivity (Table 1). PrnA and RebH share 55% sequence identity and catalyze the same overall reaction. Unsurprisingly, their overall struc-tures are very similar, with a root mean squared deviation (rmsd) of 0.99 \u00c5 for 483 aligned CR atoms. Each monomer of the structural dimer consists of an N-terminal flavin binding region with homology to flavin-dependent monooxygenases and a C-terminal substrate binding region (Figure 1C). The PrnA structure provided the first evidence that there was no direct interaction between the tryptophan and flavin interme-diates by revealing that >10 \u00c5 separate the flavin and tryp-tophan binding sites.29,30 Lys79 (in both RebH and PrnA) is located between the flavin and tryptophan binding sites and \u223c4 \u00c5 from the site of chlorination on tryptophan, which could allow a Lys79 chloramine to direct chlorination to this position.29,30 Lys79 is completely conserved across known and predicted flavin-dependent halogenases, and its muta-tion completely eliminates enzyme activity.29,30 Glu357 (RebH numbering, Glu346 in PrnA) appears ideally positioned in the structure for deprotonation of the tryptophan following chlorination.29,30 Non-heme Iron and O2-Dependent Halogenases. The first in vitro activity of a non-heme iron-dependent haloge-nase was demonstrated in 2005 by Vaillancourt and co-work-ers.32 Since then at least three other family members have been characterized,4 and the structure of the halogenase SyrB2 has been solved.33 All known members of this class act on a phosphopantetheine-tethered substrate during natural product biosynthesis by NRPS machinery. The structure of SyrB2 revealed an antiparallel None-sandwich or cupin fold com-mon to mononuclear iron/R-ketoglutarate (RKG)-dependent enzymes (Figure 1D). The iron coordination in SyrB2 is unusual, with only two histidine ligands coordinating the iron. Most iron/RKG-dependent enzymes have a third carboxylate ligand to iron, but in the halogenases this is replaced by a chloride. The remaining three coordination sites are occupied by the bidentate RKG and a water molecule. The overall reaction catalyzed by SyrB2 is shown in Scheme 1D. The proposed mechanism parallels that of non-heme iron dioxygenases and has been discussed in detail.4 Briefly, binding of dioxygen to the iron center leads to oxida-tive decarboxylation of RKG and formation of an Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate, which abstracts a hydrogen from the substrate. The resulting substrate radical then combines with Cl\u2022 to give chlorinated product. Involvement of an Fe(IV)-oxo in hydro-gen atom abstraction has been shown through Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy in the SyrB2 homologue CytC3.34 The use of a radical halogenation mechanism allows non-heme iron enzymes to regioselectively halogenate substrates at unacti-vated, aliphatic carbons (Table 1). Nucleophilic Halogenases. Thus far, only one native fluo-rinase has been characterized, the 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenos-ine synthase (5\u2032-FDAS) from Streptomyces cattleya, whose structure was solved in 2004.35 The enzyme employs a nucleophilic mechanism of fluorination and uses AdoMet as a substrate (Table 1). In a unique reversal of the typical methy-lation reaction catalyzed by AdoMet-dependent enzymes, 5\u2032-FDAS exploits L-Met as an excellent leaving group for an SN2-type reaction. 35,36 The fluorinase catalyzes attack of F-on AdoMet to produce 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (5\u2032-FDA) (Scheme 1E). 5\u2032-FDAS can also catalyze chlorination, although the reverse reaction (dechlorination) is thermodynamically favored.36 Recently, a homologue of 5\u2032-FDAS, SalL from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica, was characterized and shown to catalyze nucleophilic chlorination under native con-ditions.37 SalL, which has 35% sequence identity with 5\u2032-FDAS, converts AdoMet to 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (5\u2032-ClDA) and cannot perform fluorination. The fold of the nucleophilic halogenases is unique (Figure 1E), and structures of 5\u2032-FDAS and SalL can be superimposed with an rmsd of 1.37 \u00c5 for 248 CR atoms.35,37 The mono-mer is composed of two domains, an N-terminal Rossmann-like domain and a C-terminal None-sandwich domain. The structure is arranged as a trimer, with three active sites located between the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the adjacent monomer. The physiological oligomer is thought to be a hexamer that is created in the crystal lattice by stack-ing two trimers. Structural Perspective on Enzymatic Halogenation Blasiak and Drennan 150 ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH 147-155 January 2009 Vol. 42, No. 1 Halide Binding Sites Identification of halide binding sites in halogenase crystal structures can lead to new insight about the enzyme mecha-nism and halide specificity. Halide binding may play a partic-ularly important role in the highly regioselective halogenation reactions catalyzed by flavin-dependent, non-heme iron-de-pendent, and nucleophilic halogenases. One difficulty can be definitively assigning the identity of an electron density peak as a halide. Both Br-and I-are heavier atoms with accessi-ble anomalous signals, which can aid in their assignment. Cl-can often be assigned due to its higher \u03c3 electron density than can be explained by oxygen, but smaller F-is very difficult to distinguish from water at typical structure resolutions. Even after a halide binding site is identified, its relevance to the enzyme mechanism must still be established. Halides are typ-ical additions to crystallographic conditions, and they are com-monly found in protein structures. In fact, more than 2500 structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contain a bound chloride ion, representing greater than 5% of the currently deposited structures. For the majority of these structures, the halide is likely an artifact of the crystallization conditions. The relevance of a halide binding site can be established in sev-eral ways, including the observation of a bound halogenated product. In other cases, as for heme-dependent MPO, the importance of the observed halide binding sites remains unclear. Heme-Dependent Haloperoxidases. Structures of CPO and MPO with bound halides are currently available.13-15 When CPO crystals were soaked with high concentrations (>50 mM) of Br-and I-, seven partially occupied halide bind-ing sites were identified in anomalous difference maps.13 However, none of the halide binding sites are located near the active site, and they are therefore not likely to be relevant to the reaction with heme iron intermediates. Although chloride-soaked CPO structures have been solved, no chloride bind-ing sites were identified.13 As with CPO, soaking of MPO with Br-results in multiple halide ion binding sites.14,15 MPO crystals soaked with 20 mM NaBr have two partially occupied surface sites and one fully occupied site on the proximal side of the heme.15 Addition-ally, one Br-site (site Br1) at 44% occupancy is observed in the distal-heme cavity at 5 \u00c5 from the heme iron (Figure 2A). The bromide is only 3.1 \u00c5 from the water binding site above the distal iron. This halide site could represent a site of com-petitive inhibition with H2O2 binding, or it may be a produc-tive halide binding site in the presence of compound I. In order to mimic the structure of compound I, a bromide-soaked structure with the inhibitor CN-was obtained (Figure 2B).14 In this case, the Br-binding site (site Br2) is shifted away from the heme iron, and site Br1 instead contains a water mole-cule (Figure 2A). The difference in the bromide binding site upon CN-binding may be explained simply by steric effects; larger Br-is unable to bind near the heme once CN-is FIGURE 2. Comparison of halide binding sites. Halides shown as translucent spheres representing the halide ionic radius with Br in purple, bound. Site Br2 is >7 \u00c5 from the iron, which is too far away for direct reaction with compound I. Since MPO can catalyze iodination, even larger I-must be able to access the com-pound I intermediate. CN-is an imperfect mimic of compound I (with two atoms coordinated to the iron versus one oxygen), so potentially the larger halides could bind productively at site Br1 after compound I is formed. Alternatively, a halide bind-ing site may not be necessary, with the halides directly approaching and reacting with the compound I intermediate. Vanadium-Dependent Haloperoxidases. Thus far, a definitive halide binding site has not been established for vanadium haloperoxidases. There are no crystal structures that include a bound halide, although soaking experiments have been attempted.38 Further, no KD\u2019s have been determined for halide binding to these enzymes. The halide may not inter-act strongly with the enzyme until the peroxo intermediate has formed, which would make crystallographic characteriza-tion challenging because adding halide to crystals in the V-peroxo form would result in turnover. Flavin-Dependent Halogenases. Flavin-dependent halo-genase PrnA has a chloride binding site that packs against the re-face of the flavin cofactor (Figure 2C).30 At least three other flavin-dependent enzymes, AhpF (PDBID 1HYU), vanillyl alco-hol oxidase (PDBID 1VAO), and L-aspartate oxidase (PDBID 1KNR), contain remarkably similar chloride binding sites against the same face of the flavin. None of these enzymes have been observed to have chlorinating activity. The pres-ence of such similar halide binding sites in non-halogenases could indicate that this halide binding site is an artifact of crys-tallization. Alternatively, flavin halogenases could have evolved by exploitation of this favorable halide binding motif in order to do halogenation. The PrnA halide binding site involves backbone amide residues (347-349) that curve around Cl-. Chloride interacts with the amide NH groups of Gly349 and Thr348, and the hydrophobic ring of Pro344 completes the binding pocket. Cl-is not completely desol-vated; it forms interactions with two waters at 3.1 and 3.3 \u00c5. Non-heme Iron and O2-Dependent Halogenases. The halide binding site of non-heme iron halogenase SyrB2 is unique because the halide coordinates directly to the mono-nuclear iron (Figure 2D).33 The halide site is largely hydro-phobic and is formed by side chains of Ala118, Ser231, and Phe121. The side-on interaction with the aromatic ring of Phe121 is similar to interactions we will see at the halide bind-ing site of nucleophilic halogenases. As with flavin-depend-ent halogenases, Cl-in SyrB2 makes two interactions with waters (3.2 and 3.9 \u00c5), although one or both of these may be displaced upon substrate binding. Arg254 hydrogen bonds the apical water on the iron and is located 3.9 \u00c5 above Cl-. In a structure of SyrB2 with bromide bound in place of chlo-ride, the position of the bromide almost exactly overlays the location of the chloride, and no changes are observed in the surrounding protein structure.33 Nucleophilic Halogenases. The F-binding site in 5\u2032-FDAS can be inferred from the position of fluorine in the enzyme product complex (Figure 2E).35 The fluorine sits in a largely hydrophobic pocket composed of the backbones of residues 156-158. Two interactions are formed to the hydroxyl and amide NH of Ser158. F-is only 3.5 \u00c5 from the edge of the ring of Phe156, which has been shown to be crucial for activ-ity, likely because it helps promote desolvation of the fluo-ride. The remainder of the binding pocket is formed by Thr80 and Tyr77 and the 5\u2032-FDA molecule. 5\u2032-FDAS can catalyze chlorination as well as fluorination,36 and a 5\u2032-ClDA product complex structure is available. The fluorine and chlorine bind-ing sites overlay one another, with no changes in the sur-rounding backbone structure. However, the chlorine atom of the 5\u2032-ClDA product is shifted slightly away from Ser158, lengthening the distances to the amide backbone and side chain hydroxyl group, perhaps due to its larger size. The crystal structure of nucleophilic chlorinase SalL was also solved with bound 5\u2032-ClDA product (Figure 2F). The major change in the active site compared with 5\u2032-FDAS is replace-ment of Ser158 (131 in SalL) with a glycine. This substitu-tion eliminates one interaction to the halide and slightly increases the size of the halide binding pocket. The edge of the aromatic ring of Tyr70 (Thr75 in 5\u2032-FDAS) fills in the space left by the missing serine. Additionally, a side-on interaction with Phe156 in 5\u2032-FDAS is replaced with a similarly positioned Trp129 in SalL. Comparison of Halide Binding Sites. There are several interesting trends in the composition of the observed halide binding sites. In no cases do the negatively charged halides form close interactions with positively charged amino acids, such as arginine or lysine. In both the flavin-dependent halo-genase and the fluorinase structures, the halides are coordi-nated by a curved stretch of backbone and make interactions with amide NHs. The halides are typically bound in a largely hydrophobic pocket, and side-on interactions with phenylala-nine rings are commonly observed. The edges of aromatic rings bear a partial positive charge and therefore are thought to favor interaction with small anions.39 Similar amide nitro-gen interactions and ring-edge aromatic interactions have also been observed in halide binding sites of dehalogenase enzymes.40 We also note that only the nucleophilic haloge-Structural Perspective on Enzymatic Halogenation Blasiak and Drennan 152 ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH 147-155 January 2009 Vol. 42, No. 1 nases bind a completely desolvated halide, which could allow fluorination by activating usually hydrated F-for nucleophilic attack. Halogenation Specificity To understand how and why halogenases are selective for particular halides, several factors must be considered. The rel-ative electronegativity, nucleophilicity, and size of the halides (Table 2) can influence their suitability for different halogena-tion strategies. Additionally, when a clear halide binding site exists, steric factors may limit the size of the accepted halo-gen (ionic radii (\u00c5): fluoride, 1.33; chloride, 1.81; bromide, 1.96; iodide,: 2.20).41 Here we discuss what is known about halide selectivity for the different halogenases and describe what is currently understood about the basis for this specific-ity. Many questions concerning halide selectivity remain, and further investigation would help validate our current mecha-nistic understanding of halogenation. Heme-Dependent Haloperoxidases. Heme-haloperoxi-dases can oxidize all halides with an electronegativity below a given threshold.9 Thus, if the enzyme can catalyze chlori-nation, it can also catalyze bromination and iodination. None of these enzymes have the redox power to oxidize highly electronegative F-, and only MPO can efficiently catalyze chlo-rination at neutral pH. Enzyme-dependent halide specificity can be at least partially explained in terms of a simple redox argument.9,42,43 The standard redox potentials for conver-sion between HOX and X-follow the trend Cl-> Br-> I-. Likewise, the redox potentials for conversion from compound I to Fe(III) decrease from MPO > EPO > LPO, which parallels the decreasing oxidative power of these enzymes. Thus, MPO readily catalyzes chlorination, EPO can oxidize Br-and I-, and LPO only reacts with I-. The electron-withdrawing effects of the covalent sulfonium linkage between Met243 of MPO and the heme likely play an important role in tuning the redox potential of the two-electron reduction of compound I.9,44 This sulfonium linkage is not present in EPO or LPO, which may help explain their lower redox potentials. Vanadium-Dependent Haloperoxidases. The vanadium haloperoxidases are named for the most electronegative halo-gen they can readily oxidize, and only chloro-, bromo-, and iodoperoxidases are known.20 As with heme-dependent haloperoxidases, the vanadium-peroxo intermediate is not powerful enough to oxidize electronegative F-. However, there remains an interesting question of selectivity between Cl-, Br-, and I-. Why do some haloperoxidases readily cata-lyze chlorination, while others can only oxidize iodide? Com-parison of the crystal structures of bromoperoxidases with the chloroperoxidase reveals that the vanadate binding residues are largely conserved.20,21 There are a few residues near the active site that differ between V-CPO and V-BPOs: Arg395 in V-BPOs is a tryptophan in V-CPO, and His480 in V-BPOs is a phenylalanine in V-CPO. In one exciting experiment, BPO from C. pilulifera was endowed with chlorination activity by mutat-ing Arg395 to either tryptophan or phenylalanine.45 The mutant enzyme still retained bromination activity. Given that all haloperoxidases are capable of oxidizing the less electro-negative and larger halides (for example, chloroperoxidases can also brominate and iodinate), it seems unlikely that halide specificity is mediated by a selective halide binding event. Rather, changes in hydrogen bonding capabilities and the presence of charged residues around the active site may tune the redox properties of the vanadium-peroxo intermediate and influence its ability to react with increasingly electroneg-ative halides. FADH2-Dependent Halogenases. Several flavin-depend-ent halogenases can catalyze bromination reactions, as well as chlorination, although with lower efficiency.27,46,47 Thus far, no flavin-dependent halogenases are known to cata-lyze fluorination or iodination. The proposed mecha-nism1,4,29 involves halide oxidation to an X+ equivalent, and thus it would be highly unexpected for these enzymes to have the redox potential to oxidize electronegative F-. The lack of iodination activity could be explained by the larger size of I-impeding binding to the correct site. Alter-natively, the relatively high instability of a lysine iodamine adduct could play a role, resulting in competition between productive halogenation and nonproductive hydrolysis of a lysine iodamine intermediate. The observed halide bind-ing site is quite small, with several enzyme-Cl-distances of <3.5 \u00c5, which would favor Cl-binding over Br-or I-, but it will be mechanistically interesting to determine whether I-can access this site. Non-heme Iron and O2-Dependent Halogenases. Non-heme iron halogenases can catalyze both chlorination and bromination, although the bromination reactions are less efficient.48 No fluorination or iodination activity has been observed. The halide binding site can accommodate a bro-mide ion, as evidenced by the bromide-bound structure.33 TABLE 2. Trends in the Halides The higher redox potential for conversion of F-to the rad-ical could again be responsible for the lack of fluorination activity. Alternatively, binding of F-to the iron at the cor-rect site might be disfavored by the high cost of desolva-tion of the fluoride. The lack of activity with I-likely results from a steric inability of this larger ion to bind the correct coordination site, although as yet no I-binding studies have been reported. Nucleophilic Halogenases. 5\u2032-FDAS catalyzes chlorina-tion as well as fluorination, but no evidence for either bromi-nation or iodination has been observed.36 The chlorination activity was initially overlooked, because the reaction equilib-rium greatly favors the reverse reaction. As described above, the halide binding site easily accommodates the larger Cl-ion. Therefore, the fluorination specificity depends on the larger relative nucleophilicity of the desolvated fluoride ver-sus chloride. Although when solvated in water the nucleophi-lity of the halides is reversed from their basicity, the halide binding site of 5\u2032-FDAS is designed to fully desolvate the flu-oride. When unencumbered by protic solvent, the order of nucleophilicity is expected to follow F-> Cl-> Br-> I-. The small size of the halide binding site may sterically prevent the fluorinase from catalyzing bromination or iodination, while, as discussed below, the larger binding site of the chlorinase SalL permits these reactions. The exciting discovery of SalL, the nucleophilic chlorinase, has helped illuminate the underlying causes of halide speci-ficity.37 SalL can catalyze chlorination, bromination, and iodi-nation, but not fluorination. The main factors appear to be a slightly larger halide binding pocket and the loss of an inter-action with the hydroxyl of Ser158 (5\u2032-FDAS numbering, Gly131 in SalL). A Gly131Ser SalL mutant is inactive, but a Tyr70Thr/Gly131Ser double mutant actually improves SalL\u2019s chlorination and bromination activity while eliminating the iodination activity.37 The size of the halide binding pocket in the SalL double mutant is smaller than in the wild-type enzyme, explaining the lack of iodination. However, the dou-ble mutant SalL is still unable to perform fluorination, proba-bly because the halide binding pocket remains larger and more open than that in the fluorinase. Thus, comparison of SalL and 5\u2032-FDAS have permitted evaluation of subtle active site changes that create a binding site optimized for a partic-ular halide. Conclusions Nature has devised a range of halogenation mechanisms tai-lored to different halide, cofactor, and substrate reactivities, and crystallographic structure determination has proven essen-tial in gaining an initial understanding of these mechanisms. Structural analysis has allowed visualization of metal centers and cofactors, led to identification of key residues involved in catalysis, pinpointed the location (or absence) of halide bind-ing sites, and provided insight into halogenase regioselectiv-ity and specificity. The haloperoxidases are optimized for electrophilic activa-tion of halides but lack clear specificity and regioselectivity. Redox factors, rather than selective halide binding, appear to play a large role in the reactivity of haloperoxidases with dif-ferent halides. Flavin-dependent halogenases also employ a peroxo intermediate to form an X+ equivalent, but regiose-lectivity is apparently achieved through trapping the haloge-nating species as a covalent intermediate. A wider range of nonaromatic substrates is accessed through use of a power-ful non-heme iron cofactor and radical halogenation strategy. Thus far, the only known fluorinase employs a nucleophilic mechanism that takes advantage of the excellent nucleophi-licity of desolvated F-. The fluorinase also exploits the prop-erties of its substrate (AdoMet) to allow this unusual nucleophilic reaction. The recent discovery of halogenases that employ a nucleophilic mechanism with the less electronega-tive halogens highlights the rapid pace of development in our understanding of biological halogenation. The structural char-acterization of the nucleophilic chlorinase illustrated how sub-tle changes in a halide binding site can tune enzyme selectivity for particular halides. Further detailed structural and biochemical investigation of halide binding and selectivity in flavin-dependent and non-heme iron-dependent halogena-ses is clearly required and would help validate our current mechanistic understanding.

        "halogen substituents frequently afford key structural features that account for the potency and selectivity of nat-ural products, including antibiotics and hormones. For example, when a single chlorine atom on the antibiotic vanco-",
        "mycin is replaced by hydrogen, the resulting antibacterial activity decreases by up to 70% (Harris, C. M.; Kannan, R.; Kopecka, H.; Harris, T. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 6652-6658). This Account analyzes how structure underlies mechanism in halogenases, the molecular machines designed by nature to incorporate halogens into diverse substrates. Traditional synthetic methods of integrating halogens into complex molecules are often complicated by a lack of spec-ificity and regioselectivity. Nature, however, has developed a variety of elegant mechanisms for halogenating specific sub-strates with both regio-and stereoselectivity. An improved understanding of the biological routes toward halogenation could lead to the development of novel synthetic methods for the creation of new compounds with enhanced functions. Already, researchers have co-opted a fluorinase from the microorganism Streptomyces cattleya to produce 18F-labeled molecules for use in positron emission tomography (PET) (Deng, H.; Cobb, S. L.; Gee, A. D.; Lockhart, A.; Martarello, L.; McGlinchey, R. P.; O\u2019Hagan, D.; Onega, M. Chem. Commun. 2006, 652-654). Therefore, the discovery and characterization of naturally occur-ring enzymatic halogenation mechanisms has become an active area of research. The catalogue of known halogenating enzymes has expanded from the familiar haloperoxidases to include oxygen-dependent enzymes and fluorinases. Recently, the discovery of a nucleophilic halogenase that catalyzes chlorinations has expanded the repertoire of biological halogenation chemistry (Dong, C.; Huang, F.; Deng, H.; Schaffrath, C.; Spencer, J. B.; O\u2019Hagan, D.; Naismith, J. H. Nature 2004, 427, 561-565). Structural characterization has provided a basis toward a mech-anistic understanding of the specificity and chemistry of these enzymes. In particular, the latest crystallographic snapshots of active site architecture and halide binding sites have provided key insights into enzyme catalysis. Herein is a summary of the five classes of halogenases, focusing on the three most recently discovered: flavin-depend-ent halogenases, non-heme iron-dependent halogenases, and nucleophilic halogenases. Further, the potential roles of halide-binding sites in determining halide selectivity are discussed, as well as whether or not binding-site composition is always a seminal factor for selectivity. Expanding our understanding of the basic chemical principles that dictate the activity of the halogenases will advance both biology and chemistry. A thorough mechanistic analysis will elucidate the biological princi-ples that dictate specificity, and the application of those principles to new synthetic techniques will expand the utility of halo-genations in small-molecule development.",

        "Introduction Halogenating enzymes can be divided into the hydrogen per-oxide (H2O2)-requiring haloperoxidases (heme-dependent or vanadium-dependent), the oxygen-dependent halogenases (flavin-dependent or non-heme iron-dependent), and the nucleophilic halogenases.1-5 For all classes of halogenases, structural information has proven critical in developing our understanding of mechanism. Here we examine questions of halogenation reactivity and specificity from the primary per-spective of enzyme structure, focusing on the recent struc-tures of flavin-dependent, non-heme iron-dependent, and nucleophilic halogenases. Proposed general mechanistic strat-egies and substrate requirements of each class are shown in Table 1. Additionally, there are other enzymes with known",
        "peroxo intermediate, which is vulnerable to attack by a halide ion. As with the heme-dependent enzymes, there is still some disagreement over the nature of the halogenating species, in particular, whether the substrate reacts predominantly with free hypohalous acid or with some form of enzyme bound V-OX intermediate.20,21 Experimental evidence suggests that these enzymes can perform certain reactions with regioselec-tivity or enantioselectivity supporting reaction with a \u201ctrapped\u201d X+ equivalent,23,24 while in other cases no selectivity is observed.20 Indeed, the Ascophyllum nodosum enzyme is puri-fied with a halogen-modified surface tryptophan, which could result from free diffusion of an enzyme self-generated X+ equivalent.25 Drawing conclusions is further complicated by the fact that the exact physiological roles and substrates of most vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases are unknown. Thus, enzyme activity is often assayed with a generic monochlorodimedone (MCD) substrate (Scheme 1B). The dis-covery of three vanadium haloperoxidase genes within a nat-ural product gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 presents an exciting opportunity to characterize haloperoxi-dases with their physiological substrates.22",
        "The first crystal structure of a vanadium-dependent halop-eroxidase was solved for the chloroperoxidase (V-CPO) from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis (Figure 1B).26 The vanadate binding site sits at the bottom of a \u223c10 \u00c5 solvent-accessible channel. More recently, highly homologous structures of three algal bromoperoxidases (V-BPOs) were completed from Ascophyllum nodosum, Corallina officinalis, and Corallina pilulifera.20,21",
        "FADH2 and O2-Dependent Halogenases. Many flavin-dependent halogenases have now been characterized, and they can be divided into two main groups: those that cata-lyze chlorination on free small-molecule substrates (RebH, PrnA)27-30 and those that react with substrates tethered to a thiolation domain in a nonribosomal polypeptide synthetase (NRPS) system (PltA, SgcC3).1,4 To date, the structures of only two confirmed flavin-dependent halogenases have been solved, PrnA from Pseudomonas fluorescens30 and RebH from",

        "Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes,29,31 and both enzymes cata-lyze the chlorination of the free amino acid L-tryptophan on C7 (Scheme 1C).",
        "Flavin-dependent halogenases require reduced flavin (FADH2), which is provided by a partner-protein reductase (NADH-dependent RebF for RebH). There is clear spectroscopic evidence for reaction of FADH2 with dioxygen to form a FAD-C4a-OOH intermediate,28 which could react with Cl-to pro-duce hypochlorous acid (HOCl). In the most recently proposed mechanism, HOCl then covalently modifies a protein residue (Lys79 in RebH and PrnA) that in turn acts as the direct chlo-rinating agent.29 This hypothesis is supported by the observed regioselectivity and the identification of a long-lived, kineti-cally competent chlorinating intermediate, as well as by struc-tural analysis.29 Flavin-dependent halogenases employ an oxidative strategy of chlorination (with formation of a Cl+ equivalent) similar to haloperoxidases and require an electron-rich substrate, although the route through a covalent protein intermediate adds the benefit of regioselectivity (Table 1).",
        "PrnA and RebH share 55% sequence identity and catalyze the same overall reaction. Unsurprisingly, their overall struc-tures are very similar, with a root mean squared deviation (rmsd) of 0.99 \u00c5 for 483 aligned CR atoms. Each monomer of the structural dimer consists of an N-terminal flavin binding region with homology to flavin-dependent monooxygenases and a C-terminal substrate binding region (Figure 1C). The PrnA structure provided the first evidence that there was no direct interaction between the tryptophan and flavin interme-diates by revealing that >10 \u00c5 separate the flavin and tryp-tophan binding sites.29,30 Lys79 (in both RebH and PrnA) is located between the flavin and tryptophan binding sites and \u223c4 \u00c5 from the site of chlorination on tryptophan, which could allow a Lys79 chloramine to direct chlorination to this position.29,30 Lys79 is completely conserved across known and predicted flavin-dependent halogenases, and its muta-tion completely eliminates enzyme activity.29,30 Glu357 (RebH numbering, Glu346 in PrnA) appears ideally positioned in the structure for deprotonation of the tryptophan following chlorination.29,30",
        "Non-heme Iron and O2-Dependent Halogenases. The first in vitro activity of a non-heme iron-dependent haloge-nase was demonstrated in 2005 by Vaillancourt and co-work-ers.32 Since then at least three other family members have been characterized,4 and the structure of the halogenase SyrB2 has been solved.33 All known members of this class act on a phosphopantetheine-tethered substrate during natural product biosynthesis by NRPS machinery. The structure of SyrB2 revealed an antiparallel None-sandwich or cupin fold com-mon to mononuclear iron/R-ketoglutarate (RKG)-dependent enzymes (Figure 1D). The iron coordination in SyrB2 is unusual, with only two histidine ligands coordinating the iron. Most iron/RKG-dependent enzymes have a third carboxylate ligand to iron, but in the halogenases this is replaced by a chloride. The remaining three coordination sites are occupied by the bidentate RKG and a water molecule.",
        "The overall reaction catalyzed by SyrB2 is shown in Scheme 1D. The proposed mechanism parallels that of non-heme iron dioxygenases and has been discussed in detail.4 Briefly, binding of dioxygen to the iron center leads to oxida-tive decarboxylation of RKG and formation of an Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate, which abstracts a hydrogen from the substrate. The resulting substrate radical then combines with Cl\u2022 to give chlorinated product. Involvement of an Fe(IV)-oxo in hydro-gen atom abstraction has been shown through Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopy in the SyrB2 homologue CytC3.34 The use of a radical halogenation mechanism allows non-heme iron enzymes to regioselectively halogenate substrates at unacti-vated, aliphatic carbons (Table 1).",
        "Nucleophilic Halogenases. Thus far, only one native fluo-rinase has been characterized, the 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenos-ine synthase (5\u2032-FDAS) from Streptomyces cattleya, whose structure was solved in 2004.35 The enzyme employs a nucleophilic mechanism of fluorination and uses AdoMet as a substrate (Table 1). In a unique reversal of the typical methy-lation reaction catalyzed by AdoMet-dependent enzymes, 5\u2032-FDAS exploits L-Met as an excellent leaving group for an SN2-type reaction. 35,36 The fluorinase catalyzes attack of F-on AdoMet to produce 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (5\u2032-FDA) (Scheme 1E). 5\u2032-FDAS can also catalyze chlorination, although the reverse reaction (dechlorination) is thermodynamically favored.36 Recently, a homologue of 5\u2032-FDAS, SalL from the marine bacterium Salinispora tropica, was characterized and shown to catalyze nucleophilic chlorination under native con-ditions.37 SalL, which has 35% sequence identity with 5\u2032-FDAS, converts AdoMet to 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine (5\u2032-ClDA) and cannot perform fluorination.",
        "The fold of the nucleophilic halogenases is unique (Figure 1E), and structures of 5\u2032-FDAS and SalL can be superimposed with an rmsd of 1.37 \u00c5 for 248 CR atoms.35,37 The mono-mer is composed of two domains, an N-terminal Rossmann-like domain and a C-terminal None-sandwich domain. The structure is arranged as a trimer, with three active sites located between the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the adjacent monomer. The physiological oligomer is thought to be a hexamer that is created in the crystal lattice by stack-ing two trimers.",

        "Halide Binding Sites Identification of halide binding sites in halogenase crystal structures can lead to new insight about the enzyme mecha-nism and halide specificity. Halide binding may play a partic-ularly important role in the highly regioselective halogenation reactions catalyzed by flavin-dependent, non-heme iron-de-pendent, and nucleophilic halogenases. One difficulty can be definitively assigning the identity of an electron density peak as a halide. Both Br-and I-are heavier atoms with accessi-ble anomalous signals, which can aid in their assignment. Cl-can often be assigned due to its higher \u03c3 electron density than can be explained by oxygen, but smaller F-is very difficult to distinguish from water at typical structure resolutions. Even after a halide binding site is identified, its relevance to the enzyme mechanism must still be established. Halides are typ-ical additions to crystallographic conditions, and they are com-monly found in protein structures. In fact, more than 2500 structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contain a bound chloride ion, representing greater than 5% of the currently deposited structures. For the majority of these structures, the halide is likely an artifact of the crystallization conditions. The relevance of a halide binding site can be established in sev-eral ways, including the observation of a bound halogenated product. In other cases, as for heme-dependent MPO, the importance of the observed halide binding sites remains unclear.",
        "Heme-Dependent Haloperoxidases. Structures of CPO and MPO with bound halides are currently available.13-15 When CPO crystals were soaked with high concentrations (>50 mM) of Br-and I-, seven partially occupied halide bind-ing sites were identified in anomalous difference maps.13 However, none of the halide binding sites are located near the active site, and they are therefore not likely to be relevant to the reaction with heme iron intermediates. Although chloride-soaked CPO structures have been solved, no chloride bind-ing sites were identified.13",
        "As with CPO, soaking of MPO with Br-results in multiple halide ion binding sites.14,15 MPO crystals soaked with 20 mM NaBr have two partially occupied surface sites and one fully occupied site on the proximal side of the heme.15 Addition-ally, one Br-site (site Br1) at 44% occupancy is observed in the distal-heme cavity at 5 \u00c5 from the heme iron (Figure 2A). The bromide is only 3.1 \u00c5 from the water binding site above the distal iron. This halide site could represent a site of com-petitive inhibition with H2O2 binding, or it may be a produc-tive halide binding site in the presence of compound I. In order to mimic the structure of compound I, a bromide-soaked structure with the inhibitor CN-was obtained (Figure 2B).14 In this case, the Br-binding site (site Br2) is shifted away from the heme iron, and site Br1 instead contains a water mole-cule (Figure 2A). The difference in the bromide binding site upon CN-binding may be explained simply by steric effects; larger Br-is unable to bind near the heme once CN-is",

Since MPO can catalyze iodination, even larger I-must be able to access the com-pound I intermediate. CN-is an imperfect mimic of compound I (with two atoms coordinated to the iron versus one oxygen), so potentially the larger halides could bind productively at site Br1 after compound I is formed. Alternatively, a halide bind-ing site may not be necessary, with the halides directly approaching and reacting with the compound I intermediate.",
        "Vanadium-Dependent Haloperoxidases. Thus far, a definitive halide binding site has not been established for vanadium haloperoxidases. There are no crystal structures that include a bound halide, although soaking experiments have been attempted.38 Further, no KD\u2019s have been determined for halide binding to these enzymes. The halide may not inter-act strongly with the enzyme until the peroxo intermediate has formed, which would make crystallographic characteriza-tion challenging because adding halide to crystals in the V-peroxo form would result in turnover.",
        "Flavin-Dependent Halogenases. Flavin-dependent halo-genase PrnA has a chloride binding site that packs against the re-face of the flavin cofactor (Figure 2C).30 At least three other flavin-dependent enzymes, AhpF (PDBID 1HYU), vanillyl alco-hol oxidase (PDBID 1VAO), and L-aspartate oxidase (PDBID 1KNR), contain remarkably similar chloride binding sites against the same face of the flavin. None of these enzymes have been observed to have chlorinating activity. The pres-ence of such similar halide binding sites in non-halogenases could indicate that this halide binding site is an artifact of crys-tallization. Alternatively, flavin halogenases could have evolved by exploitation of this favorable halide binding motif in order to do halogenation. The PrnA halide binding site involves backbone amide residues (347-349) that curve around Cl-. Chloride interacts with the amide NH groups of Gly349 and Thr348, and the hydrophobic ring of Pro344 completes the binding pocket. Cl-is not completely desol-vated; it forms interactions with two waters at 3.1 and 3.3 \u00c5.",
        "Non-heme Iron and O2-Dependent Halogenases. The halide binding site of non-heme iron halogenase SyrB2 is unique because the halide coordinates directly to the mono-nuclear iron (Figure 2D).33 The halide site is largely hydro-phobic and is formed by side chains of Ala118, Ser231, and Phe121. The side-on interaction with the aromatic ring of Phe121 is similar to interactions we will see at the halide bind-ing site of nucleophilic halogenases. As with flavin-depend-ent halogenases, Cl-in SyrB2 makes two interactions with waters (3.2 and 3.9 \u00c5), although one or both of these may be displaced upon substrate binding. Arg254 hydrogen bonds the apical water on the iron and is located 3.9 \u00c5 above Cl-. In a structure of SyrB2 with bromide bound in place of chlo-ride, the position of the bromide almost exactly overlays the location of the chloride, and no changes are observed in the surrounding protein structure.33",
        "Nucleophilic Halogenases. The F-binding site in 5\u2032-FDAS can be inferred from the position of fluorine in the enzyme product complex (Figure 2E).35 The fluorine sits in a largely hydrophobic pocket composed of the backbones of residues 156-158. Two interactions are formed to the hydroxyl and amide NH of Ser158. F-is only 3.5 \u00c5 from the edge of the ring of Phe156, which has been shown to be crucial for activ-ity, likely because it helps promote desolvation of the fluo-ride. The remainder of the binding pocket is formed by Thr80 and Tyr77 and the 5\u2032-FDA molecule. 5\u2032-FDAS can catalyze chlorination as well as fluorination,36 and a 5\u2032-ClDA product complex structure is available. The fluorine and chlorine bind-ing sites overlay one another, with no changes in the sur-rounding backbone structure. However, the chlorine atom of the 5\u2032-ClDA product is shifted slightly away from Ser158, lengthening the distances to the amide backbone and side chain hydroxyl group, perhaps due to its larger size.",
        "The crystal structure of nucleophilic chlorinase SalL was also solved with bound 5\u2032-ClDA product (Figure 2F). The major change in the active site compared with 5\u2032-FDAS is replace-ment of Ser158 (131 in SalL) with a glycine. This substitu-tion eliminates one interaction to the halide and slightly increases the size of the halide binding pocket. The edge of the aromatic ring of Tyr70 (Thr75 in 5\u2032-FDAS) fills in the space left by the missing serine. Additionally, a side-on interaction with Phe156 in 5\u2032-FDAS is replaced with a similarly positioned Trp129 in SalL.",
        "Comparison of Halide Binding Sites. There are several interesting trends in the composition of the observed halide binding sites. In no cases do the negatively charged halides form close interactions with positively charged amino acids, such as arginine or lysine. In both the flavin-dependent halo-genase and the fluorinase structures, the halides are coordi-nated by a curved stretch of backbone and make interactions with amide NHs. The halides are typically bound in a largely hydrophobic pocket, and side-on interactions with phenylala-nine rings are commonly observed. The edges of aromatic rings bear a partial positive charge and therefore are thought to favor interaction with small anions.39 Similar amide nitro-gen interactions and ring-edge aromatic interactions have also been observed in halide binding sites of dehalogenase enzymes.40 We also note that only the nucleophilic haloge-",

        "Halogenation Specificity To understand how and why halogenases are selective for particular halides, several factors must be considered. The rel-ative electronegativity, nucleophilicity, and size of the halides (Table 2) can influence their suitability for different halogena-tion strategies. Additionally, when a clear halide binding site exists, steric factors may limit the size of the accepted halo-gen (ionic radii (\u00c5): fluoride, 1.33; chloride, 1.81; bromide, 1.96; iodide,: 2.20).41 Here we discuss what is known about halide selectivity for the different halogenases and describe what is currently understood about the basis for this specific-ity. Many questions concerning halide selectivity remain, and further investigation would help validate our current mecha-nistic understanding of halogenation.",
        "Heme-Dependent Haloperoxidases. Heme-haloperoxi-dases can oxidize all halides with an electronegativity below a given threshold.9 Thus, if the enzyme can catalyze chlori-nation, it can also catalyze bromination and iodination. None of these enzymes have the redox power to oxidize highly electronegative F-, and only MPO can efficiently catalyze chlo-rination at neutral pH. Enzyme-dependent halide specificity can be at least partially explained in terms of a simple redox argument.9,42,43 The standard redox potentials for conver-sion between HOX and X-follow the trend Cl-> Br-> I-. Likewise, the redox potentials for conversion from compound I to Fe(III) decrease from MPO > EPO > LPO, which parallels the decreasing oxidative power of these enzymes. Thus, MPO readily catalyzes chlorination, EPO can oxidize Br-and I-, and LPO only reacts with I-. The electron-withdrawing effects of the covalent sulfonium linkage between Met243 of MPO and the heme likely play an important role in tuning the redox potential of the two-electron reduction of compound I.9,44 This sulfonium linkage is not present in EPO or LPO, which may help explain their lower redox potentials.",
        "Vanadium-Dependent Haloperoxidases. The vanadium haloperoxidases are named for the most electronegative halo-gen they can readily oxidize, and only chloro-, bromo-, and iodoperoxidases are known.20 As with heme-dependent haloperoxidases, the vanadium-peroxo intermediate is not powerful enough to oxidize electronegative F-. However, there remains an interesting question of selectivity between Cl-, Br-, and I-. Why do some haloperoxidases readily cata-lyze chlorination, while others can only oxidize iodide? Com-parison of the crystal structures of bromoperoxidases with the chloroperoxidase reveals that the vanadate binding residues are largely conserved.20,21 There are a few residues near the active site that differ between V-CPO and V-BPOs: Arg395 in V-BPOs is a tryptophan in V-CPO, and His480 in V-BPOs is a phenylalanine in V-CPO. In one exciting experiment, BPO from C. pilulifera was endowed with chlorination activity by mutat-ing Arg395 to either tryptophan or phenylalanine.45 The mutant enzyme still retained bromination activity. Given that all haloperoxidases are capable of oxidizing the less electro-negative and larger halides (for example, chloroperoxidases can also brominate and iodinate), it seems unlikely that halide specificity is mediated by a selective halide binding event. Rather, changes in hydrogen bonding capabilities and the presence of charged residues around the active site may tune the redox properties of the vanadium-peroxo intermediate and influence its ability to react with increasingly electroneg-ative halides.",
        "FADH2-Dependent Halogenases. Several flavin-depend-ent halogenases can catalyze bromination reactions, as well as chlorination, although with lower efficiency.27,46,47 Thus far, no flavin-dependent halogenases are known to cata-lyze fluorination or iodination. The proposed mecha-nism1,4,29 involves halide oxidation to an X+ equivalent, and thus it would be highly unexpected for these enzymes to have the redox potential to oxidize electronegative F-. The lack of iodination activity could be explained by the larger size of I-impeding binding to the correct site. Alter-natively, the relatively high instability of a lysine iodamine adduct could play a role, resulting in competition between productive halogenation and nonproductive hydrolysis of a lysine iodamine intermediate. The observed halide bind-ing site is quite small, with several enzyme-Cl-distances of <3.5 \u00c5, which would favor Cl-binding over Br-or I-, but it will be mechanistically interesting to determine whether I-can access this site.",
        "Non-heme Iron and O2-Dependent Halogenases. Non-heme iron halogenases can catalyze both chlorination and bromination, although the bromination reactions are less efficient.48 No fluorination or iodination activity has been observed. The halide binding site can accommodate a bro-mide ion, as evidenced by the bromide-bound structure.33",
        "TABLE 2. Trends in the Halides",
        "The higher redox potential for conversion of F-to the rad-ical could again be responsible for the lack of fluorination activity. Alternatively, binding of F-to the iron at the cor-rect site might be disfavored by the high cost of desolva-tion of the fluoride. The lack of activity with I-likely results from a steric inability of this larger ion to bind the correct coordination site, although as yet no I-binding studies have been reported.",
        "Nucleophilic Halogenases. 5\u2032-FDAS catalyzes chlorina-tion as well as fluorination, but no evidence for either bromi-nation or iodination has been observed.36 The chlorination activity was initially overlooked, because the reaction equilib-rium greatly favors the reverse reaction. As described above, the halide binding site easily accommodates the larger Cl-ion. Therefore, the fluorination specificity depends on the larger relative nucleophilicity of the desolvated fluoride ver-sus chloride. Although when solvated in water the nucleophi-lity of the halides is reversed from their basicity, the halide binding site of 5\u2032-FDAS is designed to fully desolvate the flu-oride. When unencumbered by protic solvent, the order of nucleophilicity is expected to follow F-> Cl-> Br-> I-. The small size of the halide binding site may sterically prevent the fluorinase from catalyzing bromination or iodination, while, as discussed below, the larger binding site of the chlorinase SalL permits these reactions.",
        "The exciting discovery of SalL, the nucleophilic chlorinase, has helped illuminate the underlying causes of halide speci-ficity.37 SalL can catalyze chlorination, bromination, and iodi-nation, but not fluorination. The main factors appear to be a slightly larger halide binding pocket and the loss of an inter-action with the hydroxyl of Ser158 (5\u2032-FDAS numbering, Gly131 in SalL). A Gly131Ser SalL mutant is inactive, but a Tyr70Thr/Gly131Ser double mutant actually improves SalL\u2019s chlorination and bromination activity while eliminating the iodination activity.37 The size of the halide binding pocket in the SalL double mutant is smaller than in the wild-type enzyme, explaining the lack of iodination. However, the dou-ble mutant SalL is still unable to perform fluorination, proba-bly because the halide binding pocket remains larger and more open than that in the fluorinase. Thus, comparison of SalL and 5\u2032-FDAS have permitted evaluation of subtle active site changes that create a binding site optimized for a partic-ular halide.",
        "Conclusions Nature has devised a range of halogenation mechanisms tai-lored to different halide, cofactor, and substrate reactivities, and crystallographic structure determination has proven essen-tial in gaining an initial understanding of these mechanisms. Structural analysis has allowed visualization of metal centers and cofactors, led to identification of key residues involved in catalysis, pinpointed the location (or absence) of halide bind-ing sites, and provided insight into halogenase regioselectiv-ity and specificity.",
        "The haloperoxidases are optimized for electrophilic activa-tion of halides but lack clear specificity and regioselectivity. Redox factors, rather than selective halide binding, appear to play a large role in the reactivity of haloperoxidases with dif-ferent halides. Flavin-dependent halogenases also employ a peroxo intermediate to form an X+ equivalent, but regiose-lectivity is apparently achieved through trapping the haloge-nating species as a covalent intermediate. A wider range of nonaromatic substrates is accessed through use of a power-ful non-heme iron cofactor and radical halogenation strategy. Thus far, the only known fluorinase employs a nucleophilic mechanism that takes advantage of the excellent nucleophi-licity of desolvated F-. The fluorinase also exploits the prop-erties of its substrate (AdoMet) to allow this unusual nucleophilic reaction. The recent discovery of halogenases that employ a nucleophilic mechanism with the less electronega-tive halogens highlights the rapid pace of development in our understanding of biological halogenation. The structural char-acterization of the nucleophilic chlorinase illustrated how sub-tle changes in a halide binding site can tune enzyme selectivity for particular halides. Further detailed structural and biochemical investigation of halide binding and selectivity in flavin-dependent and non-heme iron-dependent halogena-ses is clearly required and would help validate our current mechanistic understanding.",
