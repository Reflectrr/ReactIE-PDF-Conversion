The comparison of 3D protein structures of the different VHPO helpedidentify the residues that govern the molecular mechanisms of catalysis and specificity of VHPO. Vana-dium K-edge XAS gave further important insight to understand the fine changes around the vanadiumcofactor during the catalytic cycle. The combination of different structural approaches, at different scalesof resolution, shed new light on biological vanadium coordination in the active site, and its importancefor the catalytic cycle and halide specificity of vanadium haloperoxidases.1 w g n w t a o c m a A p a w H t p d h d h o h i a a t p g u ( h a b i c s N c c f s 2 v 2 t t . IntroductionIn Nature, many organic compounds incorporate halogen atoms,hich is often an essential step for the biological properties of halo-enated antibiotics, drugs or signaling molecules [1]. Halogenatedatural products are most commonly chlorinated or brominated,hile iodinated and fluorinated compounds are rare, and all struc-ural classes of chemicals are represented, from simple phenolicnd aliphatic compounds, to complex alkaloids, polyketides andligopeptides [2,3]. A large majority of the biogenic halogenatedompounds have been isolated in marine organisms, especiallyarine macroalgae, which seem to be important actors of iodinend bromine transfers in the coastal marine environment [4\u20136].mong halogenating enzymes, haloperoxidases utilize hydrogeneroxide for electrophilic halogenation, via the oxidation of halidesccording to the following reaction: H2O2+ X-+ H+\u2192 H2O + HOX,herein X-represents a halide ion and may be Cl-, Br-or I-.aloperoxidases have been classified in two groups, according tohe nature of their cofactor, vanadium or heme (iron-containingorphyrin) [1,7\u201310]. Metal-free haloperoxidases have also beenescribed in some bacteria [11]. Since the discovery of the firsteme haloperoxidase, in the 1960s, from the terrestrial fungus Cal-ariomyces fumago [12] a number of other heme haloperoxidasesave been characterized [1,9]. In this review, we focus on the sec-nd important group of haloperoxidases, the vanadium-dependentaloperoxidases (VHPO). In marine algae, these enzymes could benvolved in anti-oxidant protection and in chemical defense andre likely to have a key role in the biochemical part of the iodinend bromine cycling in marine environment [13,14]. Starting withheir discovery thirty years ago [15], this review highlights the mainrogress that has been obtained on the biochemistry and on thelobal and fine structural characteristics of VHPO, based on molec-lar cloning, crystallography and X-ray absorption spectroscopyXAS). They are classified according to the most electronegativealide that they can oxidize, i.e. chloroperoxidases (VCPO) can cat-lyze the oxidation of chloride as well as of bromide and iodide, andromoperoxidases (VBPO) react with bromide and iodide, whereasodoperoxidases (VIPO) are specific for iodide. Until recently, onlyhloro-and bromoperoxidases from eukaryotic species have beentudied, showing a fragmental view of this large enzyme family.ovel types of VHPO discovered in marine bacteria give now somelues to explore new biosynthetic pathways of natural halogenatedompounds through in vitro heterologous expression, but also tourther study the structure\u2013function relationships in catalytic andpecificity mechanisms, and to shed light on VHPO family evolution.. Biochemical and molecular characterization ofanadium haloperoxidases.1. On the discovery of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases inhe brown alga Ascophyllum nodosumInterest in peroxidases from brown alga arose in the 1970s,hrough studies related to the identification of antibiotics from\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.algae reporting that phloroglucinol [16], and then oligomers[17] and polymers of phloroglucinol units [18] were detectedin brown algae. These compounds were further characterized asphlorotannins as reviewed in [19]. It was rapidly hypothesized, thatperoxidases may be involved in the formation of these phenoliccompounds, unique to brown algae. Despite extraction difficul-ties, due to the complex materials (anionic mucilages containingalginate and fucans), peroxidase-activity was detected in somecrude-extract of brown algae, but the enzyme activity was par-tially lost during the purification process [20]. Intense work finallyled to the isolation of the first vanadium-dependent haloperoxi-dase from knotted wrack, the brown alga A. nodosum (Fucaceae,Fucales, Phaeophyta), called AnI in 1984 [15], showing that thisenzyme preferentially oxidized iodide and also bromide and thio-cyanide in the presence of vanadium (V), but not chloride (reviewedin [21]). The addition of iron and other metal ions had no effect onthe activity of the apoenzyme. This algal peroxidase thus was nota hemoprotein, like other iodoperoxidases from plants such as thewell-known horseradish peroxidases [22]. Anecdotal, in the 1970s,vanadium was not considered to be an essential element in biologyor in medicine, and until 1984, no scientific study has reported thatvanadium could be a natural component of any enzyme. Conse-quently the paper on the vanadium-dependence of this new algalhaloperoxidase [15] was not accepted in the first instance. How-ever, since vanadium accumulation has been reported in ascidiansin 1911 by Henze [23] experiments to test the effect of vanadiumcompounds were proposed by Vilter and coworkers. Indeed Vil-ter had observed an effect when solutions were aliquoted usinga Hamilton syringe that brought the solutions in contact withvanadium-containing steel. Inspired by these effects, significantincrease in haloperoxidase activity was observed in subsequentexperiments using vanadate-containing buffers. At that time, thedetection of a vanadium-containing nitrogenase was also reported[24,25]. In 1986, the vanadate cofactor was finally confirmed forthe vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase from A. nodosum [26] andfor the alternative nitrogenase in Azotobacter chroococcum [27]. Inparallel, several reports indicated that vanadium was indeed anessential trace element for animals [28], Chlorella [29\u201332], Entero-morpha and Fucus [33]. Since its discovery, AnI was used as alaboratory model enzyme for the understanding of VHPO prop-erties. Numerous further studies were carried out to characterizethe V coordination inside the active site of AnI (later called An-VBPOI in this review), based on electron paramagnetic resonance[26,34,35], on51V NMR [36\u201338], X-ray crystallography [39,40] andon XAS ([41\u201343] see below).2.2. Biochemical characterization of vanadium haloperoxidasesVanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (EC 1.11.1.10) catalyzethe two-electron oxidation of halides (X-: I-, Br-or Cl-) in the pres-ence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by a bi-bi ping-pong mechanism.During the catalytic cycle, the vanadate cofactor, at the resting (V)state, first coordinates one molecule of H2O2to form a stable per-oxovanadate intermediate, which can then react with halide. 136 C.

In the absence of organic substrate, a secondquivalent of H2O2is oxidized to form a single oxygen and X-[for eviews [1,7,8,10,44]]..2.1. Haloperoxidase in vitro assaysFor kinetic studies, vanadium and heme haloperoxidases differrom other enzymes by the production of this very reactive andndetectable intermediate \u201cX+\u2032\u2032 . Standard assays for the determi-ation of VHPO activity are therefore based on the reactivity of thisixture with commercial chemicals. Phenol red and o-dianisidineere first reported as chemical probes for the detection of VHPO-atalyzed halogenation, but are restricted to qualitative studies45\u201347]. The monochlorodimedone (MCD) halogenation provides aimple assay to determine steady-state kinetic parameters of VCPOnd VBPO at acidic pH by monitoring the loss of absorbance of MCDt 290 nm [48\u201350]. The triodide (I3-) assay (reviewed in [21]) wassed to identify the first VIPO, i.e. specific for iodide oxidation, inrown algae of the Laminariaceae family [51\u201354]. However, thisssay presents important limits due to the high chemical insta-ility of I3-in solution. For this reason, a colorimetric assay wasater developed for the titration of both iodo-and bromoperoxi-ase activities based on the reactivity of thymolsulfonephthalein,lso named thymol blue (TB) toward oxidized bromide and iodidepecies [55]. Using this assay, novel VIPO were recently character-zed in the marine bacteria Zobellia galactanivorans [56]..2.2. Biochemical coordination of V in vanadiumaloperoxidases Vanadate (VO4) is the prosthetic group of VHPO and its incor-oration into the enzyme is necessary for the catalytic activity.ndeed the apoenzymes, produced through dialysis, feature a dras-ic decrease of activity, while the reconstitution of VHPO withqueous sodium orthovanadate leads to progressive and full recov-ry of haloperoxidase activity [15,35,57\u201360]. The ratio of vanadateer protein subunit was estimated around one VOper sub-4 nit, but was lower in VBPOII from A. nodosum [60]. The affinityf VHPO for vanadate depends on pH [15,61,62], and is muchtronger than for oxyanions, such as phosphate or molybdate Reviews 301\u2013302 (2015) 134\u2013146(HVO42-None HPO42-> AsO43-> MoO42-) [34,61]. However, the per-oxidase activity decreases in phosphate-containing buffers [21].Unlike the heme-containing enzymes, there is no change inthe oxidation state of the VHPO metal center during the synthe-sis of the halogenating agent, making them insensitive to oxidativeinactivation during turnover. VHPO enzymes are also extremelythermostable, resistant to high concentration of organic solventssuch as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, acetone [45] and dioxaneand still active in concentrated solutions of guanidine hydrochlo-ride or SDS [61,63].2.2.3. Vanadium haloperoxidase \u2013 catalyzed halogenationBecause of their biochemical properties, VHPO have receivedincreasing attention as biocatalysts for pharmaceutical andbiotechnological applications [44,64]. The halogenation mecha-nism of VHPO is still debated for unspecific diffusible species-mediated halogenation versus specific halogenation of substrateinto the active site. The main bottleneck for deciphering the bio-chemical role of an enzyme is to find its natural organic substrate.The specific halogenation patterns in natural organohalogens sug-gest that VHPO catalysis is stereo-and regio-selective in vivo[64]. However, only few reports are available about the chemicalcharacterizations of natural substrates, deduced from VHPO-based halogenation in vitro. Data are indeed restricted to eitherpurified native VHPO, as those from A. nodosum [44,60], or torecombinant active enzymes, which have been successfully over-expressed in Escherichia coli [65\u201367], in yeast system [58,59], orin other heterologous systems [68\u201370] (see Table 1 for completereferences). VHPO activities have been detected in a very large number ofmarine macroalgal classes using MCD or I3-assays [21], but thecorresponding biochemical data are very limited in early studiesbecause of the difficulties to purify such enzymes from algal matri-ces extremely rich in anionic polysaccharides and polyphenoliccompounds. The problem was solved by developing two-phaseextraction procedures, and brown algal peroxidases were obtainedin gram-amounts [20]. Up to now, a number of VHPOs have beencharacterized at the biochemical and molecular levels from redand brown macroalgae, terrestrial fungi and marine bacteria (seeTable 1 for complete references). In the brown alga A. nodosum,the two VBPO isoenzymes present at different locations in the alga[61,71] feature distinct biochemical and structural properties [60],suggesting distinct biological roles in the algal physiology. In vitrohalogenation experiments have shown that purified native VBPOIfrom A. nodosum catalyzes the bromination of pyrroles [72] or phe-nols [73], whereas the second VBPO is involved in the biosynthesisof methyl 4-bromopyrrole-2-carboxylate, a natural product iso-lated from the marine sponge [60]. Laminaria digitata also featurestwo isoforms of VHPOs, but with distinct halide specificities. One isa VBPO [53], whereas the other isoform is specific for iodide oxida-tion [54]. No specific iodinated substrate has been yet identified inL. digitata, but this particular VHPO may be involved in the veryefficient accumulation of iodide in external tissues of L. digitata[14,74,75]. Another VIPO was recently characterized at the struc-tural level in the marine flavobacterium Z. galactanivorans, whichbelongs to the bacteroidetes and is associated with both red andbrown seaweeds [56].In red algae (Table 1), VBPO were isolated from Corallina offici-nalis and Corallina pilulifera [76\u201379], and more recently VBPO fromDelisea pulchra [80] and from Gracilaria changii [81]. The VBPO-catalyzed asymmetric bromination and cyclization of certainterpenes, including nerolidol, lead to the biosynthesis of bromi-isolated or cloned from Laurencia, Plocamium and Corallina [82].The VBPO from Delisea pulchra produces bromofuranones, whichare involved in the disruption of quorum sensing of C.

Algal halogenated compounds are knowno interfere with bacterial signaling systems. Similarly, VBPO from. digitata can deactivate acylated homoserine lactones, whichre the cell-to-cell signaling molecules. Moreover halogenatedompounds from this species control the biofilm formation androwth in Gram-negative bacteria [83,84].VCPO were first characterized in terrestrial fungi, the mosttudied being that of Curvularia inaequalis ([85], Table 1 for fulleferences). The fungus C. inaequalis is able to chlorinate aromaticings of lignin in wood during the degradation process and thisction is likely to be due to the presence of VCPO enzymes [86].he VHPO-based biofilm control has been also explored for medi-al purposes: VCPO from C. inaequalis has an antimicrobial actionn Enterococcus faecalis biofilms [87].VCPOs were also identified in marine actinobacteria [68,88].nother class of interesting compounds is that of halogenatedntibiotics. Interestingly, bromoperoxidase activity was firstetected in the chloramphenicol-producing actinomycetes [89].n Streptomyces bacteria, a VCPO, encoded by the NapH1 gene,atalyzes a highly stereoselective chlorination cyclization reac-ion in napyradiomycin biosynthesis [68,88]. More recently in vitroiosynthetic experiments established the roles of VCPO from thearine bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain CNH-189 in the finalhlorination cyclization step of the merochlorin biosynthesis. Thexistence of a highly regiospecific and stereospecific reaction in thisynthesis of chlorinated antibiotics suggests that in vivo the VHPOind their natural substrates in a highly specific manner [69,70]..3. Phylogenetic relationships of vanadium haloperoxidasesVHPO share a relatively low level of overall protein sequencedentity. For instance, the fungal VHPO from C. inaequalis [85] andlternaria didymospora [90] present a protein sequence identityf 68%, and the protein sequence identities between VHPO fromrown and red algae are only in the range of 30\u201340%. At the proteinase; VCPO: vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase; X: all amino acids except R.level, only one hundred amino acid residues from the carboxyl ter-minal regions of the fungal enzymes can be aligned with VHPO frommacroalgae, with \u223c25% of similarities. This alignment bears the twofollowing short domains highly conserved in all VHPO proteins andrelated to vanadate binding (see below).(1) PxYxSGHA(2) LxxxxAxxRxxxGxHxxxDA phylogenetic analysis based on the alignment of 26 biochem-ically and/or structurally characterized VHPO (Table 1) was carriedout, including four sequences of bacterial nonspecific acid phos-phatases as outgroup [7,56]. In this phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) theVHPOs from red and brown algae group together with some VBPOsfrom Cyanobacteria, suggesting a common origin of all algal VHPOs.Inside the brown algal VHPO sub-group, two branches appear, oneincluding the first VBPO of A. nodosum and the VIPO from L. digi-tata and the other bearing the second isoform of A. nodosum andthe VBPO of L. digitata [56]. The red algal VBPOs form a strongmonophyletic group with few cyanobacterial VHPO homologousproteins, one of which has recently been characterized as VBPO ina Synechococcus strain [91]. In the other part of the tree (Fig. 1)the VIPO from Z. galactanivorans, the fungal VCPO, including thatof C. inaequalis, and the first bacterial VCPOs characterized inStreptomyces species merge as different monophyletic groups. Arecent larger phylogenetic analysis allowed the identification ofnumerous VHPO bacterial homologs in public protein databases,suggesting a larger spreading of VHPO in bacterial lineages anda significant bacterial contribution to VHPO-mediated processes[56]. Based on phylogenetic analyses VHPO could derive from aphosphatases, and their evolution may have been driven by suc-cessive lateral transfer events. Moreover the specificity for iodideoxidation results in a convergent evolution of the divergent phylaof bacteroidetes and brown algae 138 C.

A protein maximum likelihood (PML) tree was constructed using the multiple alignment of 26 eukaryote and bacterial VHPOs characterizedat the molecular and/or biochemical levels and of four Bacterial Acid Phosphatases as an outgroup. 173 informative residues were used for PML analyses and bootstrap values(500 replicates) are provided for main nodes.

Structure\u2013function of vanadium haloperoxidases.1. 3D crystallographic structures and quaternary arrangementf vanadium haloperoxidasesIn 1996, Messerschmidt and Wever published the first crystallo-raphic structure of a vanadium dependant haloperoxidase, whichas the chloroperoxidase isolated from the fungus C. inaequalis92]. The overall shape of the monomeric protein has the form of aylinder of about 80A\u030a long and 50A\u030a in diameter (Fig. 2A). The fold isompact with about 44% of the residues involved in alpha-helices.he helices form two main domains consisting of a helix-bundleach that are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis perpendicular to thexes of the helices. The two helix-bundles are often called bundles 1nd 2, in relation to their occurrence in the N-or C-terminal part ofhe enzyme, respectively. The site of fixation for vanadate is locatedt the bottom of a 20A\u030a deep cavity, situated at the N-terminal endsf bundle 2 (Fig. 2A and B).A few years after this first structural characterization of a fun-al VHPO, structures of a VBPO of algal origin were publishedsee Table 1 for full references), revealing complex multimeriza-ion of these latter ones. Indeed, the first characterized VBPOrom the brown alga A. nodosum is arranged in dimers, stabilizedy two disulfide bridges covalently linking the two monomersxidase (VCPO) activity. The available 3D structures of VHPO are indicated by a star.arrapi oxide [80], bromofuranone [80], napyradiomycin [68], merochlorin [69,70],(Fig. 2C) [39]. These dimers are able to self-arrange in more complexstructures, such as hexameric proteins, as shown by gel filtrationchromatography results obtained for VBPO from L. digitata [53] andfor the second VBPO from A. nodosum [60]. In contrast, the red algalVHPO dimers are not stabilized by covalent bonds but organized in ahexamer of dimers (Fig. 2D) [93,94]. This dodecamer is about 150A\u030a in diameter and forms a cavity in its center. This multimeric com-plex also presents a high degree of 2\u20133-point group symmetry thatis cubic. Interestingly, so far in all characterized algal VHPOs, theN-terminal helix-bundle is structurally replaced by the C-terminalhelix-bundle of a second monomer in the homo-dimeric protein,with the two molecules arranged in a \u2018head-to-tail\u2019 orientation.Multimerization is a biological strategy to stabilize proteins [95];consequently, in the case of red algal VHPOs, the high stability toorganic solvent and high temperature might be a result of the stronginteractions present in these highly symmetric multimers. In VBPOdimers, the surface of interaction represents 20 and 46% of the totalexposed surface of a monomer for C. officinalis [93] and A. nodosum[39], respectively. In contrast, in the red algal VBPO dodecamer, only12% of a monomer surface is exposed to the solvent [93,96,97].More recently, 3D structures from bacterial VHPOs (Table 1), theVCPO from Streptomyces sp. (Liscombe et al., unpublished) and theVIPO from the marine flavobacterium Z. galactanivorans [56] haveshed new light on plausible evolutionary relationships C. Leblanc et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 301\u2013302 (2015) 134\u2013146 139Fig. 2. Three dimensional structures of VHPO. (A) The monomeric VCPO from C. inaequalis (PDB Accession #, 1VNI). (B) The monomeric VIPO1 from Z. galactanivorans (PDB4CIT). (C) The homo-dimeric VBPOI from A. nodosum (PDB 1QI9). (D) The dodecameric VBPO from C. officinalis (PDB 1QHB) and C. pilulifera (PDB 1UP8). In the monomericVHPOs (A and B), the N-and C-terminal parts of the protein containing the two helix-bundle domains are colored in blue and red, respectively. For the algal VHPOs, the reda e diffea o m w r V d i a i s s e n o V i w h c t a N b e n o b nd blue colors are used to distinguish either the two identical monomers (B) or thlgal multimeric forms and fungal and bacterial monomeric formsf VHPOs. Indeed, the two bacterial VHPOs are similar to theonomeric fungal VCPO, consisting of two helix-bundle domainsithin a single polypeptide chain in the VIPO from Z. galactanivo-ans (Fig. 2B). Despite this fold-similarity, the Z. galactanivoransIPO is a monomer in solution, while VCPO of Streptomyces sp. isimeric. However, the dimerization mechanism in this latter cases very different to that found in algal VHPOs, and probably carries different biological function. The Streptomyces sp. VCPO dimer-nterface is located above the N-terminal helix-bundle, where twomall (3 and 4 residues) beta-strands form an anti-parallel betaheet. The longest beta-strand of each monomer interacts with thequivalent one in the second monomer, in an anti-parallel man-er, and together they create an interface much smaller than thatbserved in the complex multimeric algal VHPOs.As explained above, the vanadium containing active site ofHPOs is located at the N-terminal end of helices from bundle 2n fungal and bacterial VHPOs (Fig. 2A and B), and two residuesithin the second ligand sphere of the VO43-are provided by theelix bundle 1. This vanadium binding site structure is perfectlyonserved throughout all VHPOs (see below), despite the fact thathe algal VHPO lack the helix bundle 1. Indeed the missing helicesre replaced by the second monomer in the dimeric forms of VHPOs.evertheless, all VHPOs have roughly the same number of residues,etween 450 and 550 amino acids. Indeed, algal VHPOs display sev-ral additional insertions, forming helices and beta-strands that areot present in the fungal or bacterial VHPOs [56]. The comparisonf all the known haloperoxidase structures shows that a fungal oracterial VHPO monomer can be superimposed onto the dimer ofrent homodimers (D). The VO4binding sites are indicated by an arrow.an algal VHPO, with the N-terminal helix-bundle 1 of the single pep-tide chain in the monomeric forms being replaced by the \u2018back-side\u2019of the C-terminal helix-bundle belonging to the second chain of thehomodimeric form (Fig. 2C). This observation, combined with phy-logenetic analyses, has allowed postulating a bacterial origin of theancestral VHPO with a monomeric conformation [56]. In this sce-nario the loss of helix bundle 1 in algal VHPO, has probably beenthe key to dimerization: an incomplete gene transfer leading to thedeletion of helix bundle 1 exposes a hydrophobic patch at the sur-face of the protein, necessitating the replacement of this part ofthe fold by a helix bundle from a second monomer, thus facilitatingthe dimerization. The dimerization leads to the interesting featurethat the homodimeric algal VHPOs have two vanadate-containingactive sites, whereas the fungal and bacterial monomeric formsonly possess one active site per protein.3.2. Similarities between vanadium haloperoxidases and acidphosphatases In monomeric VHPOs the two domains of the same protein,the conserved C-terminal helix-bundle and variable N-terminalhelix-bundle, can be superimposed on each other at the structurallevel (Fig. 3A), despite the fact that no similarity can be detectedbetween the two helix bundles at the level of primary sequence.Interestingly, the 3D structural fold of acid phosphatases, rep-resented through the monomer structure of a non-specific acidphosphatase from Escherichia blattae [98] is constituted by a singlehelix-bundle motif. Indeed, when structurally superimposing thefive-helix-bundle of an acid phosphatase onto monomeric 140 C. Leblanc et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 301\u2013302 (2015) 134\u2013146Fig. 3. 3D structure comparison of VIPO1 from Z. galactanivorans (PDB Accession #, 4CIT) and of non-specific acid phosphatase from Escherichia blattae (PBD 1D2T).

The C-terminal helix-buundle is colored in green. The VO4or PO4binding site is indicated by an arrow.tronger similarity can be observed with the conserved C-terminalelix-bundle domain than when superimposing onto the variable-terminal helix-bundle of VHPOs (illustrated by the superimposi-ion onto the C-terminal helix-bundle of Zg-VIPO1 in Fig. 3B). Thistructural domain homology to acid phosphatases has been previ-usly identified by the comparison to Ci-VCPO [98\u2013100]. Togetherith phylogenetic analyses [56], these 3D fold-similarities suggesthat acid phosphatases and VHPOs have a common ancestor withn ancestral fold consisting of a single helix-bundle-based coreomain, and VHPOs have diverged from this ancestor fold by gene-uplication followed by gene-fusion. In this scenario, the presencef additional ligands provided by the second helix-bundle has ledo the fixation of catalytic active vanadate rather than phosphate.owever, we cannot rule out that ancestral active VHPOs containnly a single helix bundle that have then diverged into two distinctorms, either by dimerization or by gene-duplication followed byene-fusion. In any case, this evolutionary relationship betweenhosphatases and VHPOs has some functional consequences: sincehe phosphate and vanadate binding sites are sufficiently simi-ar, it has been demonstrated that the apo-form of VCPO exhibitshosphatase activity [101], whereas the phosphatases are stronglynhibited by vanadate [102]. In several 3D structures, bound phos-hate was located in VHPOs in a similar manner than the vanadateroup, either in the native Ci-VCPO [92] or in the VBPO of Coral-ina species [93,94,103]. This oxyanion is only weakly linked to theNone atom of the histidine residue, but a systematic comparison ofhosphate-and vanadate-binding proteins in the protein data bankhows high structural similarities and similar binding [104]..3. VO4coordination in the crystal structure of vanadiumaloperoxidases When studying the molecular bases of catalytic properties andalide specificity in VHPO, it is of interest to compare the 3D activeite structures of the different types of VHPO, i.e. the fungal andacterial VCPO, the algal VBPO, and the recently discovered VIPOrom Z. galactanivorans [56]. The active site pockets of the differentHPOs display strong similarities, despite the different oligomericorms of enzymes, and most of the residues tightly coordinating theatalytic vanadate are strictly conserved within C-terminal helixundle (Fig. 4), the active site pocket being also delimited by theeighboring N-terminal helix bundle in fungal and bacterial VHPOsnd by the C-terminal helix bundle from the second monomer inlgal VHPOs (Fig. 2).that is conserved with other VHPO is represented in blue and the N-terminal helixThe NNonegroup of a strictly conserved histidine (His416, His496,His494, His486, His553 and His553 in Zg-VIPO1, Ci-VCPO, Ssp-VCPO, An-VBPOI, Co-VBPO and Cp-VBPO, respectively, Fig. 4A\u2013F)is binding the vanadate, providing the fifth atom in the trigonal-bipyramidal coordination sphere of vanadium (V). As mentionedabove, the VO4binding in VHPOs also corresponds to the assumedtrigonal bipyramidal transition state of bound phosphate in thephosphatases [104]. All other ligand-atoms of the vanadium-ion arethe four oxygens from the prosthetic group. These oxygen atomsare in turn hydrogen bonded by a lysine, a serine, a histidine andtwo arginine residues that are all conserved, with one exception,viz. the replacement of the histidine (His360 in Zg-VIPO1, Fig. 4A)by a serine in the bacterial VCPO (Ser427, Fig. 4C).For the VCPO from the fungus C. inaequalis the X-ray structuresof both native and peroxide forms of the enzyme have been solvedat 2.03A\u030a and 2.24A\u030a, respectively [105]. These two structures haverevealed that the trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the vanadate inthe native form is transformed in a distorted tetragonal pyramidafter addition of hydrogen peroxide, suggesting the release of theapical oxygen ligand and the coordination of the two peroxide oxy-gens to the vanadium cofactor in the stable peroxide form of theenzyme ([105], see Scheme 1). During the catalytic cycle, at least thehistidine and one arginine (His360 and Arg410 in Zg-VIPO1, Fig. 4A)are essential residues for the coordination of the vanadate moietyand catalysis, since changing them into alanine or serine totallyswitched off haloperoxidase activity in Ci-VCPO [58,106] and in Zg-VIPO1 [56]. In the VCPO from Streptomyces sp., the serine residue(Ser427) seems to play a similar role, as its mutation in a histidineresidue abolished enzyme activity [68].Another remarkable difference in the bacterial VCPO and in allalgal VBPOs is the presence of an additional histidine, in the prox-imity of Lys341 (An-VBPOI numbering, Fig. 4D) that is replaced bya phenylalanine in the fungal VCPO. Based on the first few avail-able crystal structures [39,92\u201394,103], it was postulated that thissingle residue-difference between vanadium-dependent chloro-and bromoperoxidases, i.e. a Phe397 in VCPO (Fig. 4B) replacinga histidine residue in VBPO, was responsible for the difference inhalogen specificity [66]. Previously, the mutation of the arginineresidue (Arg397) in the red algal VBPO from C. pilulifera (Fig. 4F) hasconferred significant chloroperoxidase activity to mutant enzymesR397W and R397F [94,107]. This residue is replaced by a tryp-tophan residue in the fungal VCPO. However, the more recentcrystal structure of VIPO, having identical residues in the firstcoordination sphere of the catalytic vanadate as in VCPO C.

In this latter study, site-directed muta-enesis of residues located in a second sphere around the activeite highlighted that some of these could equally well influencehe halide-oxidation potential of this enzyme, and even the speci-city of the enzyme. Indeed, a slight bromoperoxidase activity wasbtained in two enzyme mutants, one mutated inside the activeite (Ser358, Fig. 4A) and the other mutated on a tyrosine residueocated outside the active site. The current hypothesis [7,8,55]xplains the change of catalytic properties and halide specificityy modifications of H-bond coordination and redox potential ofhe VO4moiety, rather than selective halide binding. Recent datauggest that this redox potential is finely tuned locally, but alsoy remote amino acid residues, belonging to the second and thirdphere of VO4coordination [56].. Biological Vanadium K-edge X-ray absorptionpectroscopy .1. Introduction to BioXAS and other biological Vanadium XASesults .1.1. X-ray absorption spectroscopyX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is applied to study theoordination geometry of transition metals in enzymes, as well ashanges of geometry during catalysis [108,109]. The method canlso be applied to non-invasively study halogens in whole orga-isms [14], parts thereof [110,111], or isolated enzymes [112]. The-ray absorption spectra of dilute systems (mM in metal) like bio-ogical samples are usually measured in fluorescence mode; forphosphate are represented in the center of the picture. The H-bonds between VO4vanadium this is relatively difficult compared to other 1st-row tran-sition metals, because there is less fluorescence and the K-edge is atlow energy, a range where air absorbs significantly. Some examplesof vanadium K-edge spectra are shown in Fig. 5.With monochromatic synchrotron radiation, it is possible toscan the X-ray energy around the so-called K edge of an element,for example vanadium (V). At the absorption edge, the X-ray energycorresponds to what is needed to liberate a 1s electron of V intothe continuum. The edge energy shifts to a higher value if the V isin a higher oxidation state. There is usually some fine structurepresent in this \u2018X-ray Absorption Near Edge spectrum\u2019 (XANES)which can also be represented as the first derivative in order tohighlight subtle features (Fig. 5A and B). The fine structure is dueto the electron being excited to unoccupied higher orbitals withenergies just below that of the continuum; the intensities of suchtransitions depend on their being allowed or forbidden, which inturn depends on the metal ion\u2019s coordination geometry. Above theedge, additional features, the so-called \u2018Extended X-ray Absorp-tion Fine Structure\u2019 (EXAFS, Fig. 5C) are observed, which are dueto X-ray-induced electron diffraction phenomena and can be inter-preted in terms of distance, number, and type of the surroundingligands. The EXAFS is usually displayed with the wave vector k(\u00c5-1) as energy axis, and in k3-weighting to compensate for thedecay in amplitude at higher k. The EXAFS amplitude depends onthe coordination number but this can only be determined withlimited accuracy (\u00b11) because of its correlation with the disorderphenomena, described in the so-called Debye\u2013Waller factor, thatare responsible for the aforementioned decay in the amplitude.Fourier transformation (with phase correction) of the EXAFS (FT,Fig. 5D) yields a radial distribution function in which the positionsof the maxima represent the distances of shells of ligand atoms 142 C.

Ligands like the imidazole moiety of the amino acid histi-ine give a characteristic pattern of shells for which the multiplecattering phenomenon, i.e. the scattering of the electron wave byarious ring atoms before it returns to the V absorber, has to beaken into account in the simulation. The interpretation of EXAFSs performed by means of simulation on the basis of parametersf structural models which are iteratively refined to give the opti-um agreement between theory and experiment as expressed in fit index..1.2. Biological vanadium accumulationBecause of the relatively high concentration requirements its not surprising that the first example of a study of vanadium in biological context was on organisms that actively accumulateanadium from seawater, in the form of vanadate (V(5+)O43-),iz. of the aforementioned ascidians [23], a class belonging to thehylum of tunicates [113]. The XANES of these organisms, whenompared to that of suitable model compounds, showed that theanadium was predominantly in the V(3+) state in an octahedralnvironment, while the EXAFS revealed the nearest neighbors to bexygens. In subsequent studies, the V XANES features were used touantify the amounts of V(3+) ions associated with the biologicalatecholate-based chelator tunichrome, and water and sulphate,s well as mixtures of the latter in various species [114\u2013118], and detailed mechanism for the reduction of vanadate to V(3+) wasroposed [119]. In this particular context, the role of sulphur in theanadium metabolism was also investigated with sulphur K edgeANES [120\u2013122]. Micro-distribution of V was established in livingscidian blood cells by X-ray scanning microscope in fluorescenceode and local XANES spectra revealed V(3+) and V(4+) in vivo123]. With X-ray tomography in combination with X-ray fluo-escence, three-dimensional maps of the element distribution inbjects and biological specimens such as the diatom Cyclotella cane obtained [124]. With scanning X-ray microscopy, it is possible toeft); (C) extracted Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS, top right) andctra taken with Dr. W. Meyer-Klaucke at the EMBL Outstation at DESY, Hamburg,record short ranges \u2013 XANES rather than EXAFS \u2013 of X-ray spectraat the edge of an element, and combine them with the image, tomap the distribution of that element\u2019s oxidation state. This is aninteresting approach for vanadium because of the sensitivity ofits XANES to oxidation state and ligand geometry. In applications[123,125] of this technique in relation to the aforementionedbiological vanadium accumulation, a scanning X-ray microscopystudy of cryo-fixed specimens of one type of blood cell \u2013 theso-called signet cell \u2013 from Ascidia sydneiensis samea, it was shownthat the reduction of V(5+) from seawater proceeds in 2 steps,viz. to V(4+) in the signet ring cells, and to V(3+) in the vacuole.One other occurrence of vanadium in a biological context, besidesthat of V in haloperoxidases, is that in aforementioned vanadium-dependent nitrogenases [28,126]. The XANES and EXAFS at the VK-edge of the first V-containing nitrogenase from A. chroococcumresembled very much that of a VFe3S4cubane cluster [127].4.2. Vanadium and other edge EXAFS and XANES of vanadiumhaloperoxidases 4.2.1. Early vanadium haloperoxidase XANES resultsStudies on the vanadium-containing haloperoxidases startedwith XANES of the brown alga A. nodosum bromoperoxidase [41].The prominent pre-edge peak at 5469 eV (Fig. 5A) is ascribed toa 1s\u20133d transition which is dipole-forbidden and absent in octa-hedral VO [128] but very strong in tetrahedral vanadate (Fig. 5A).For the native bromoperoxidase of A. nodosum, the feature is some-what weaker than for vanadate (Fig. 5A, [42]) which is consistentwith the trigonal bipyramidal coordination symmetry establishedin the crystallographic study [39]. A similar change was observed inthe XANES of vanadate upon binding to the chloroplast H+-ATPaseCF1 together with Mg2+and ADP; this creates an enzyme-boundtransition-state analog for ATP-hydrolysis in which the V hastrigonal-bipyramidal coordination geometry [129].The haloperoxidase XANES is not affected by addition of thesubstrate Br-(90 molar equivalents), but upon reduction theedge shifts to lower energy and the pre-edge feature is reducedin intensity [42]. Addition of 4 molar equivalents of H2O2had noeffect [42] but a significant shift of the edge to lower energy istry a m i b a w w f 4 r a t d w r i w s t i u a i o i c q h c o i a c t [ t c t [ E 2 s t t f r f e t m t a r e i o B l r e b e C. Leblanc et al. / Coordination Chem subtle increase in the pre-edge feature were observed with 15olar equivalents [43]. These changes point respectively to anncrease in average V-ligand distance and to a change in symmetry,ut not to a change in oxidation state for V. Accordingly, a mech-nism was proposed for VHPO-based bromination (Scheme 1)ithout valence change for V nor coordination of Br-to V, inhich coordination to V(5+) activates H2O2for attack by bromide,orming the hypobromite which is the halogenating agent..2.2. Vanadium haloperoxidase EXAFSThe first haloperoxidase EXAFS was obtained for the native andeduced forms of A. nodosum VBPOI in a k range of 3\u201310A\u030a-1 [42] at time when no crystallographic information was yet available. Forhe reduced enzyme, one short (1.63A\u030a) and 3 medium (1.91A\u030a) V-Oistances were identified, along with two V-N distances of 2.11A\u030a, hich were inferred to belong to imidazole moieties of histidineesidues on the basis of advanced EPR (electron spin echo) stud-es [43], and simulated as such. The results for the native enzymeere similar, but most distances (1.61, 1.72, and 2.11A\u030a) werehorter, and the more remote atoms were not explicitly assignedo imidazoles but as N or O. In a later study [130], the distancenformation was used in a bond valence sum analysis (BVSA) [131],sing known correlations between the valence, ligand distances,nd ligand geometry of ions, to correct the coordination numbernitially found [42] from 6 to 5. If one considers one of the imidaz-le or N/O ligands from the initial interpretation to be redundantn the 5-coordinate geometry, this outcome is consistent with therystallographic results, first for the VCPO from the fungus C. inae-ualis [92], later for the A. nodosum VBPO [39], that vanadium inaloperoxidases is present as vanadate, bound to the enzyme byoordination to a single imidazole residue.Although the imidazole ligand was recognized in the EXAFSf reduced enzyme on the basis of the EPR evidence [132],t was almost overlooked in the native enzyme [42]. Theforementioned current structural model for the nitrogenaseofactor FeVco also features imidazole coordination, althoughhis is not detectable in the EXAFS. The crystal structure of thevanadyl(vinylimidazole)4Cl]Cl complex revealed V-N distances inhe range 2.05\u20132.19A\u030a, and the imidazoles gave an unambiguousontribution to the EXAFS in the Fourier transform (radial distribu-ion function) in the range 2\u20134A\u030a, with an average distance of 2.11A\u030a 133], in line with the V-N distance found in the A. nodosum VBPOIXAFS [42]. It is clear from the features in the EXAFS in the range\u20134 A\u030a-1 (Fig. 5C) that there are remote shells in addition to the mainhell of oxygen (and nitrogen) ligand donors, atoms that also con-ribute to the EXAFS, but the corresponding features in the Fourierransform at 3\u20134A\u030a are relatively small (comparable to the intensityor vanadate in that region) if it is taken over a relatively long dataange (Fig. 5D). Alternative interpretations have been put forwardor the remote haloperoxidase shells, such as a shell of protein het-roatoms that are H-bonded to the vanadate [134], and, by analogyo the archaeal tungstate binding proteins [135], through-absorberultiple scattering involving the axial ligand donor atoms in therigonal bipyramid, which would appear in the Fourier transformt the sum of the V-N(imidazole) and V-O(axial) distances [136].It was concluded from V EXAFS taken over a relatively shortange (up to k = 7A\u030a-1) of the A. nodosum VBPOI in the presence ofxcess (3 molar equivalents) bromide that there is no direct V-Brnteraction (expected distance 2.45A\u030a) [137,138]. This was corrob-rated by the absence of such a contribution in the complementaryr EXAFS [139], which instead indicated the presence of Br cova-ently bound to a low-Z atom, then interpreted as due to a putativelyeactive Br-O(Ser) intermediate. It was later found [112] that thenzyme actually contains endogenous bromine in the form of bis-rominated (3,5-dibromo)-tyrosine residues, presumably due toxposure to both Br-and H2O2before or during isolation. Br EXAFS Reviews 301\u2013302 (2015) 134\u2013146 143also revealed the presence of bromine incorporated in other aminoacids, possibly tryptophan, in the VHPO of L. digitata [110].As mentioned above, the crystal structures of the native [92]and peroxo [105] forms of the C. inaequalis VCPO indicated thattwo vanadate oxygens are displaced by the peroxide which isbound in a side-on fashion, and that the geometry changes froma trigonal bipyramid with the imidazole-N in one of the apicalpositions to a square pyramid with an apical oxygen (see Scheme 1for a schematic representation of the structures, in which theellipsoids indicate the equatorial planes). While the XANES of A.nodosum VBPOI showed a significant shift to lower energy with alarge excess of H2O2(see above) [43], indicating a longer averageV-ligand distance, the corresponding spectra for C. inaequalis VCPOwith 4 molar equivalents of H2O2were rather similar. The EXAFSof both enzyme forms was also measured, compared, and analyzed[140] in an approach in which the geometry of the imidazole wasconstrained [141], i.e. the atom-atom distances within the ringwere kept in an idealized geometry, so that the whole imidazolewas treated in the refinement of the simulations as a unit. TheEXAFS distances agree within 0.1A\u030a to the crystallographic onesfor the native enzyme, but in the peroxo form the crystallographyseems to overestimate the V-N and two of the V-O distances by0.15\u20130.25 A\u030a. The comparison is complicated by the pH difference,8.3 vs. 6.0 for diffraction and spectroscopy, respectively. Whilethe crystal structures indicate a significant increase (up to 0.25A\u030a) in the V-ligand distances for the peroxo form, the EXAFS showsa small (up to 0.10A\u030a) decrease, if a change at all, which is in linewith the C. inaequalis VCPO XANES results [140].4.2.3. Outlook: merging XANES and EXAFSAs mentioned in the introduction, the XANES region of the X-rayabsorption spectrum is usually treated as spectroscopy (interpre-tation in terms of transitions) and the EXAFS as (X-ray inducedelectron) diffraction. The EXAFS is simulated with 1-dimensionalstructural models (radial distribution function independent of thearrangement of the atoms in space) or sometimes 2-dimensional(multiple scattering within an imidazole ring) or 3-dimensionalmodels (through-absorber multiple scattering involving lineararrangements of absorber and 2 ligand atoms). It has been rec-ognized for some time that it should be possible to simulate theXANES on the basis of the same structural models, but defined in 3dimensions, that account for the EXAFS; there is, however, as yet noconvenient approach for the simulation of both regions of the spec-tra. The examples given above [42,140] show that it is possible tosimulate EXAFS data on the basis of the so-called \u2018muffin-tin poten-tial\u2019 calculations, in which the atoms involved are potential wellsseparated by an area defined by a common interstitial potential.There is however a growing insight [141,142] that such an approachis too crude to reproduce important features in the XANES, andthat the more complex full-potential finite difference method [143]has to be applied to this region. The challenge now is to interpretboth ranges of the spectrum with the same underlying theoreticalmodel. One could go back and forth with one or more structuralmodels between simulations of the XANES and EXAFS regions ofthe spectra, adjusting distance information in the EXAFS and 3-dimensional information in the XANES, until a consistent structuralmodel has been reached. In view of the still increasing power ofcomputational approaches such as the ADF Density Functional The-ory package [144], it is also tempting to generate computationalstructures which can be validated/adjusted in both the EXAFS andXANES part of the X-ray absorption spectrum.5. Conclusions and future prospectsDuring the last thirty years, extensive research on differentvanadium-dependent haloperoxidases was undertaken in order 1 istry c c p o t c c o p b e [ i t i c r s h s fi s o o t t t s a b m t o l f o t p i d m t g b p r t V l i p i o i h b f o t s t r e t a 44 C. Leblanc et al. / Coordination Chemharacterize halogenation through VHPOs. Based on informationoming from crystal structures, model compounds of the cofactorossessing catalytic center have been analyzed and modeled inrder to understand the vanadium coordination occurring in pro-eins [145], although these models only account for the firstoordination sphere observed in proteins. Extensive modeling andhemical analyses have also helped advance on the understandingf the mechanistic reactivity of this metal-organic active center, byredicting the most stable functional model, K[VO(O2)(heida)], toe an effective biomimetic catalyst for VHPOs, also providing anxplanation for the differences in chloro-and bromo-peroxidases146]. Much progress has also been obtained by classical biochem-cal studies, X-ray crystallography and spectroscopic analyses ofhe global and fine local structures of the native and peroxo-ntermediate forms of the enzymes. The resolution of a proteinrystal-structure of a VHPO specific for iodide oxidation [56] hasecently allowed further exploring the molecular origin of halideelectivity, which still remains an intriguing question. Indeed thealide specificity in VHPO is related to many interacting factors,uch as the amino acid composition of the active site and thene electronic environment of the vanadate pocket. This lattertudy also showed that the 2nd coordination sphere of the per-xo intermediate appears to play an equally important role. Inrder to decipher the complete catalytic mechanisms of VHPOs andheir contrasting reactivity toward different halides, it is importanto pursue and enhance the combination of approaches, under-aking protein crystallographic studies in parallel to fine localtructure analyses by XAS and EXAFS, on the different VHPOvailable and specific site-directed mutants that show modifiediochemical kinetics. For instance, the fine tuning of the VO4oiety during the catalytic cycle should be explored throughhe measurement and interpretation of the EXAFS and XANESf haloperoxidases at various edges in parallel (V, I, Br). Theseocal structural studies not only provide a good starting pointor computational studies on the protonation state of vanadater on the catalytic intermediates [145,147\u2013150], but also providehe possibility to test structural hypotheses through analyses ofoint-mutants. VHPOs are indeed interesting models of researchn chemistry to mimic the activity of vanadate centers, using oxi-ovanadium (IV) and dioxidovanadium (V) stabilized by organicolecules [45,151]. However, recent studies [56] have shownhat the influence of the protein stabilization of the active centeroes beyond the first coordination sphere. At the long term, theiochemical and structural characterizations of known and sup-lementary VHPOs will be necessary, in particular at very highesolution (beyond 1A\u030a) and possibly using neutron-diffractiono precisely locate proton positions, to infer global evolution ofHPO enzymatic mechanisms among bacterial and eukaryoticineages. Another black box remains the biological roles of these enzymesn living organisms. The very large panel of halogenated compoundsroduced by marine organisms, especially by red and brown algae,s likely to have important biological or ecological functions. More-ver the presence of a tremendous number of VHPO-homologsn all bacterial lineages suggests the involvement of VHPO-basedalogenation in numerous bacterial biosynthetic pathways. In thisiological context, an important bottleneck is the development ofunctional approaches for deciphering the biochemical functionsf VHPO, for finding their specific substrates and for identifyinghe natural halogenated products, they are producing in vivo. Theet-up of heterologous expression and in vitro reconstituted sys-ems are challenging, especially for marine bacteria, but the recentesults obtained on Streptomyces sp. [69,70] have opened inter-sting perspectives in this research area. In future developments,hese advances will certainly give rise to potential biotechnologicalpplications either for generating halogenated biologically active Reviews 301\u2013302 (2015) 134\u2013146analogs or for improving biological properties of metabolites byenzymatic halogenation.Acknowledgements This work was supported by the \u2018Centre National de la RechercheScientifique\u2019 and \u2018Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris 06\u2019, and bythe French National Research Agency with regards to the invest-ment expenditure program IDEALG (http://www.idealg.ueb.eu/,grant agreement No. ANR-10-BTBR-04).

        "IntroductionIn Nature, many organic compounds incorporate halogen atoms,hich is often an essential step for the biological properties of halo-enated antibiotics, drugs or signaling molecules [1]. Halogenatedatural products are most commonly chlorinated or brominated,hile iodinated and fluorinated compounds are rare, and all struc-ural classes of chemicals are represented, from simple phenolicnd aliphatic compounds, to complex alkaloids, polyketides andligopeptides [2,3]. A large majority of the biogenic halogenatedompounds have been isolated in marine organisms, especiallyarine macroalgae, which seem to be important actors of iodinend bromine transfers in the coastal marine environment [4\u20136].mong halogenating enzymes, haloperoxidases utilize hydrogeneroxide for electrophilic halogenation, via the oxidation of halidesccording to the following reaction: H2O2+ X-+ H+\u2192 H2O + HOX,herein X-represents a halide ion and may be Cl-, Br-or I-.aloperoxidases have been classified in two groups, according tohe nature of their cofactor, vanadium or heme (iron-containingorphyrin) [1,7\u201310]. Metal-free haloperoxidases have also beenescribed in some bacteria [11]. Since the discovery of the firsteme haloperoxidase, in the 1960s, from the terrestrial fungus Cal-ariomyces fumago [12] a number of other heme haloperoxidasesave been characterized [1,9]. In this review, we focus on the sec-nd important group of haloperoxidases, the vanadium-dependentaloperoxidases (VHPO). In marine algae, these enzymes could benvolved in anti-oxidant protection and in chemical defense andre likely to have a key role in the biochemical part of the iodinend bromine cycling in marine environment [13,14]. Starting withheir discovery thirty years ago [15], this review highlights the mainrogress that has been obtained on the biochemistry and on thelobal and fine structural characteristics of VHPO, based on molec-lar cloning, crystallography and X-ray absorption spectroscopyXAS). They are classified according to the most electronegativealide that they can oxidize, i.e. chloroperoxidases (VCPO) can cat-lyze the oxidation of chloride as well as of bromide and iodide, andromoperoxidases (VBPO) react with bromide and iodide, whereasodoperoxidases (VIPO) are specific for iodide. Until recently, onlyhloro-and bromoperoxidases from eukaryotic species have beentudied, showing a fragmental view of this large enzyme family.ovel types of VHPO discovered in marine bacteria give now somelues to explore new biosynthetic pathways of natural halogenatedompounds through in vitro heterologous expression, but also tourther study the structure\u2013function relationships in catalytic andpecificity mechanisms, and to shed light on VHPO family",

These compounds were further characterized asphlorotannins as reviewed in [19]. It was rapidly hypothesized, thatperoxidases may be involved in the formation of these phenoliccompounds, unique to brown algae. Despite extraction difficul-ties, due to the complex materials (anionic mucilages containingalginate and fucans), peroxidase-activity was detected in somecrude-extract of brown algae, but the enzyme activity was par-tially lost during the purification process [20]. Intense work finallyled to the isolation of the first vanadium-dependent haloperoxi-dase from knotted wrack, the brown alga A. nodosum (Fucaceae,Fucales, Phaeophyta), called AnI in 1984 [15], showing that thisenzyme preferentially oxidized iodide and also bromide and thio-cyanide in the presence of vanadium (V), but not chloride (reviewedin [21]). The addition of iron and other metal ions had no effect onthe activity of the apoenzyme. This algal peroxidase thus was nota hemoprotein, like other iodoperoxidases from plants such as thewell-known horseradish peroxidases [22]. Anecdotal, in the 1970s,vanadium was not considered to be an essential element in biologyor in medicine, and until 1984, no scientific study has reported thatvanadium could be a natural component of any enzyme. Conse-quently the paper on the vanadium-dependence of this new algalhaloperoxidase [15] was not accepted in the first instance. How-ever, since vanadium accumulation has been reported in ascidiansin 1911 by Henze [23] experiments to test the effect of vanadiumcompounds were proposed by Vilter and coworkers. Indeed Vil-ter had observed an effect when solutions were aliquoted usinga Hamilton syringe that brought the solutions in contact withvanadium-containing steel. Inspired by these effects, significantincrease in haloperoxidase activity was observed in subsequentexperiments using vanadate-containing buffers. At that time, thedetection of a vanadium-containing nitrogenase was also reported[24,25]. In 1986, the vanadate cofactor was finally confirmed forthe vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase from A. nodosum [26] andfor the alternative nitrogenase in Azotobacter chroococcum [27]. Inparallel, several reports indicated that vanadium was indeed anessential trace element for animals [28], Chlorella [29\u201332], Entero-morpha and Fucus [33]. Since its discovery, AnI was used as alaboratory model enzyme for the understanding of VHPO prop-erties. Numerous further studies were carried out to characterizethe V coordination inside the active site of AnI (later called An-VBPOI in this review), based on electron paramagnetic resonance[26,34,35], on51V NMR [36\u201338], X-ray crystallography [39,40] andon XAS ([41\u201343] see",

The monochlorodimedone (MCD) halogenation provides aimple assay to determine steady-state kinetic parameters of VCPOnd VBPO at acidic pH by monitoring the loss of absorbance of MCDt 290 nm [48\u201350]. The triodide (I3-) assay (reviewed in [21]) wassed to identify the first VIPO, i.e. specific for iodide oxidation, inrown algae of the Laminariaceae family [51\u201354]. However, thisssay presents important limits due to the high chemical insta-ility of I3-in solution. For this reason, a colorimetric assay wasater developed for the titration of both iodo-and bromoperoxi-ase activities based on the reactivity of thymolsulfonephthalein,lso named thymol blue (TB) toward oxidized bromide and iodidepecies [55].

        "[61,63].2.2.3. Vanadium haloperoxidase \u2013 catalyzed halogenationBecause of their biochemical properties, VHPO have receivedincreasing attention as biocatalysts for pharmaceutical andbiotechnological applications [44,64]. The halogenation mecha-nism of VHPO is still debated for unspecific diffusible species-mediated halogenation versus specific halogenation of substrateinto the active site. The main bottleneck for deciphering the bio-chemical role of an enzyme is to find its natural organic substrate.The specific halogenation patterns in natural organohalogens sug-gest that VHPO catalysis is stereo-and regio-selective in vivo[64]. However, only few reports are available about the chemicalcharacterizations of natural substrates, deduced from VHPO-based halogenation in vitro. Data are indeed restricted to eitherpurified native VHPO, as those from A. nodosum [44,60], or torecombinant active enzymes, which have been successfully over-expressed in Escherichia coli [65\u201367], in yeast system [58,59], orin other heterologous systems [68\u201370] (see Table 1 for completereferences). VHPO activities have been detected in a very large number ofmarine macroalgal classes using MCD or I3-assays [21], but thecorresponding biochemical data are very limited in early studiesbecause of the difficulties to purify such enzymes from algal matri-ces extremely rich in anionic polysaccharides and polyphenoliccompounds. The problem was solved by developing two-phaseextraction procedures, and brown algal peroxidases were obtainedin gram-amounts [20]. Up to now, a number of VHPOs have beencharacterized at the biochemical and molecular levels from redand brown macroalgae, terrestrial fungi and marine bacteria (seeTable 1 for complete references). In the brown alga A. nodosum,the two VBPO isoenzymes present at different locations in the alga[61,71] feature distinct biochemical and structural properties [60],suggesting distinct biological roles in the algal physiology. In vitrohalogenation experiments have shown that purified native VBPOIfrom A. nodosum catalyzes the bromination of pyrroles [72] or phe-nols [73], whereas the second VBPO is involved in the biosynthesisof methyl 4-bromopyrrole-2-carboxylate, a natural product iso-lated from the marine sponge [60]. Laminaria digitata also featurestwo isoforms of VHPOs, but with distinct halide specificities. One isa VBPO [53], whereas the other isoform is specific for iodide oxida-tion [54]. No specific iodinated substrate has been yet identified inL. digitata, but this particular VHPO may be involved in the veryefficient accumulation of iodide in external tissues of L. digitata[14,74,75]. Another VIPO was recently characterized at the struc-tural level in the marine flavobacterium Z. galactanivorans, whichbelongs to the bacteroidetes and is associated with both red andbrown seaweeds [56].In red algae (Table 1), VBPO were isolated from Corallina offici-nalis and Corallina pilulifera [76\u201379], and more recently VBPO fromDelisea pulchra [80] and from Gracilaria changii [81].

In VBPOdimers, the surface of interaction represents 20 and 46% of the totalexposed surface of a monomer for C. officinalis [93] and A. nodosum[39], respectively. In contrast, in the red algal VBPO dodecamer, only12% of a monomer surface is exposed to the solvent [93,96,97].More recently, 3D structures from bacterial VHPOs (Table 1), theVCPO from Streptomyces sp.

Thistructural domain homology to acid phosphatases has been previ-usly identified by the comparison to Ci-VCPO [98\u2013100]. Togetherith phylogenetic analyses [56], these 3D fold-similarities suggesthat acid phosphatases and VHPOs have a common ancestor withn ancestral fold consisting of a single helix-bundle-based coreomain, and VHPOs have diverged from this ancestor fold by gene-uplication followed by gene-fusion. In this scenario, the presencef additional ligands provided by the second helix-bundle has ledo the fixation of catalytic active vanadate rather than phosphate.owever, we cannot rule out that ancestral active VHPOs containnly a single helix bundle that have then diverged into two distinctorms, either by dimerization or by gene-duplication followed byene-fusion. In any case, this evolutionary relationship betweenhosphatases and VHPOs has some functional consequences: sincehe phosphate and vanadate binding sites are sufficiently simi-ar, it has been demonstrated that the apo-form of VCPO exhibitshosphatase activity [101], whereas the phosphatases are stronglynhibited by vanadate [102]. In several 3D structures, bound phos-hate was located in VHPOs in a similar manner than the vanadateroup, either in the native Ci-VCPO [92] or in the VBPO of Coral-ina species [93,94,103].

        "When studying the molecular bases of catalytic properties andalide specificity in VHPO, it is of interest to compare the 3D activeite structures of the different types of VHPO, i.e. the fungal andacterial VCPO, the algal VBPO, and the recently discovered VIPOrom Z. galactanivorans [56]. The active site pockets of the differentHPOs display strong similarities, despite the different oligomericorms of enzymes, and most of the residues tightly coordinating theatalytic vanadate are strictly conserved within C-terminal helixundle (Fig. 4), the active site pocket being also delimited by theeighboring N-terminal helix bundle in fungal and bacterial VHPOsnd by the C-terminal helix bundle from the second monomer inlgal VHPOs (Fig.",

As mentionedabove, the VO4binding in VHPOs also corresponds to the assumedtrigonal bipyramidal transition state of bound phosphate in thephosphatases [104]. All other ligand-atoms of the vanadium-ion arethe four oxygens from the prosthetic group. These oxygen atomsare in turn hydrogen bonded by a lysine, a serine, a histidine andtwo arginine residues that are all conserved, with one exception,viz. the replacement of the histidine (His360 in Zg-VIPO1, Fig. 4A)by a serine in the bacterial VCPO (Ser427, Fig. 4C).For the VCPO from the fungus C. inaequalis the X-ray structuresof both native and peroxide forms of the enzyme have been solvedat 2.03A\u030a and 2.24A\u030a, respectively [105]. These two structures haverevealed that the trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the vanadate inthe native form is transformed in a distorted tetragonal pyramidafter addition of hydrogen peroxide, suggesting the release of theapical oxygen ligand and the coordination of the two peroxide oxy-gens to the vanadium cofactor in the stable peroxide form of theenzyme ([105], see Scheme 1). During the catalytic cycle, at least thehistidine and one arginine (His360 and Arg410 in Zg-VIPO1, Fig. 4A)are essential residues for the coordination of the vanadate moietyand catalysis, since changing them into alanine or serine totallyswitched off haloperoxidase activity in Ci-VCPO [58,106] and in Zg-VIPO1 [56]. In the VCPO from Streptomyces sp., the serine residue(Ser427) seems to play a similar role, as its mutation in a histidineresidue abolished enzyme activity [68].Another remarkable difference in the bacterial VCPO and in allalgal VBPOs is the presence of an additional histidine, in the prox-imity of Lys341 (An-VBPOI numbering, Fig. 4D) that is replaced bya phenylalanine in the fungal VCPO. Based on the first few avail-able crystal structures [39,92\u201394,103], it was postulated that thissingle residue-difference between vanadium-dependent chloro-and bromoperoxidases, i.e. a Phe397 in VCPO (Fig. 4B) replacinga histidine residue in VBPO, was responsible for the difference inhalogen specificity [66]. Previously, the mutation of the arginineresidue (Arg397) in the red algal VBPO from C. pilulifera (Fig. 4F) hasconferred significant chloroperoxidase activity to mutant enzymesR397W and R397F [94,107].

Some examplesof vanadium K-edge spectra are shown in Fig. 5.With monochromatic synchrotron radiation, it is possible toscan the X-ray energy around the so-called K edge of an element,for example vanadium (V). At the absorption edge, the X-ray energycorresponds to what is needed to liberate a 1s electron of V intothe continuum. The edge energy shifts to a higher value if the V isin a higher oxidation state. There is usually some fine structurepresent in this \u2018X-ray Absorption Near Edge spectrum\u2019 (XANES)which can also be represented as the first derivative in order tohighlight subtle features (Fig. 5A and B). The fine structure is dueto the electron being excited to unoccupied higher orbitals withenergies just below that of the continuum; the intensities of suchtransitions depend on their being allowed or forbidden, which inturn depends on the metal ion\u2019s coordination geometry.

Whilethe crystal structures indicate a significant increase (up to 0.25A\u030a) in the V-ligand distances for the peroxo form, the EXAFS showsa small (up to 0.10A\u030a) decrease, if a change at all, which is in linewith the C. inaequalis VCPO XANES results",
        "[140].4.2.3. Outlook: merging XANES and EXAFSAs mentioned in the introduction, the XANES region of the X-rayabsorption spectrum is usually treated as spectroscopy (interpre-tation in terms of transitions) and the EXAFS as (X-ray inducedelectron) diffraction. The EXAFS is simulated with 1-dimensionalstructural models (radial distribution function independent of thearrangement of the atoms in space) or sometimes 2-dimensional(multiple scattering within an imidazole ring) or 3-dimensionalmodels (through-absorber multiple scattering involving lineararrangements of absorber and 2 ligand atoms). It has been rec-ognized for some time that it should be possible to simulate theXANES on the basis of the same structural models, but defined in 3dimensions, that account for the EXAFS; there is, however, as yet noconvenient approach for the simulation of both regions of the spec-tra. The examples given above [42,140] show that it is possible tosimulate EXAFS data on the basis of the so-called \u2018muffin-tin poten-tial\u2019 calculations, in which the atoms involved are potential wellsseparated by an area defined by a common interstitial potential.There is however a growing insight [141,142] that such an approachis too crude to reproduce important features in the XANES, andthat the more complex full-potential finite difference method [143]has to be applied to this region. The challenge now is to interpretboth ranges of the spectrum with the same underlying theoreticalmodel. One could go back and forth with one or more structuralmodels between simulations of the XANES and EXAFS regions ofthe spectra, adjusting distance information in the EXAFS and 3-dimensional information in the XANES, until a consistent structuralmodel has been reached. In view of the still increasing power ofcomputational approaches such as the ADF Density Functional The-ory package [144], it is also tempting to generate computationalstructures which can be validated/adjusted in both the EXAFS andXANES part of the X-ray absorption",

Based on informationoming from crystal structures, model compounds of the cofactorossessing catalytic center have been analyzed and modeled inrder to understand the vanadium coordination occurring in pro-eins [145], although these models only account for the firstoordination sphere observed in proteins. Extensive modeling andhemical analyses have also helped advance on the understandingf the mechanistic reactivity of this metal-organic active center, byredicting the most stable functional model, K[VO(O2)(heida)], toe an effective biomimetic catalyst for VHPOs, also providing anxplanation for the differences in chloro-and bromo-peroxidases146]. Much progress has also been obtained by classical biochem-cal studies, X-ray crystallography and spectroscopic analyses ofhe global and fine local structures of the native and peroxo-ntermediate forms of the enzymes. The resolution of a proteinrystal-structure of a VHPO specific for iodide oxidation [56] hasecently allowed further exploring the molecular origin of halideelectivity, which still remains an intriguing question. Indeed thealide specificity in VHPO is related to many interacting factors,uch as the amino acid composition of the active site and thene electronic environment of the vanadate pocket. This lattertudy also showed that the 2nd coordination sphere of the per-xo intermediate appears to play an equally important role. Inrder to decipher the complete catalytic mechanisms of VHPOs andheir contrasting reactivity toward different halides, it is importanto pursue and enhance the combination of approaches, under-aking protein crystallographic studies in parallel to fine localtructure analyses by XAS and EXAFS, on the different VHPOvailable and specific site-directed mutants that show modifiediochemical kinetics. For instance, the fine tuning of the VO4oiety during the catalytic cycle should be explored throughhe measurement and interpretation of the EXAFS and XANESf haloperoxidases at various edges in parallel (V, I, Br). Theseocal structural studies not only provide a good starting pointor computational studies on the protonation state of vanadater on the catalytic intermediates [145,147\u2013150], but also providehe possibility to test structural hypotheses through analyses ofoint-mutants. VHPOs are indeed interesting models of researchn chemistry to mimic the activity of vanadate centers, using oxi-ovanadium (IV) and dioxidovanadium (V) stabilized by organicolecules [45,151]. However, recent studies [56] have shownhat the influence of the protein stabilization of the active centeroes beyond the first coordination sphere. At the long term, theiochemical and structural characterizations of known and sup-lementary VHPOs will be necessary, in particular at very highesolution (beyond 1A\u030a) and possibly using neutron-diffractiono precisely locate proton positions, to infer global evolution ofHPO enzymatic mechanisms among bacterial and eukaryoticineages.",
        "Another black box remains the biological roles of these enzymesn living organisms. The very large panel of halogenated compoundsroduced by marine organisms, especially by red and brown algae,s likely to have important biological or ecological functions. More-ver the presence of a tremendous number of VHPO-homologsn all bacterial lineages suggests the involvement of VHPO-basedalogenation in numerous bacterial biosynthetic pathways. In thisiological context, an important bottleneck is the development ofunctional approaches for deciphering the biochemical functionsf VHPO, for finding their specific substrates and for identifyinghe natural halogenated products, they are producing in vivo. Theet-up of heterologous expression and in vitro reconstituted sys-ems are challenging, especially for marine bacteria, but the recentesults obtained on Streptomyces sp. [69,70] have opened inter-sting perspectives in this research area. In future developments,hese advances will certainly give rise to potential biotechnologicalpplications either for generating halogenated biologically",
