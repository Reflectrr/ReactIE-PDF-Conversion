Balskus* Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States *S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The cylindrocyclophanes are a family of natural products that share a remarkable paracyclophane carbon scaffold. Using genome sequencing and bioinfor-matic analyses, we have discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster involved in the assembly of cylindrocyclophane F. Through a combination of in vitro enzyme characterization and feeding studies, we confirm the connection between this gene cluster and cylindrocyclophane production, elucidate the chemical events involved in initiating and terminating an unusual type I polyketide synthase assembly line, and discover that macrocycle assembly involves functionalization of an unactivated carbon center. Living organisms such as bacteria and plants produce a widevariety of secondary metabolites, many of which have complex chemical structures. Natural products with unusual molecular architecture are of interest to both chemical biologists and synthetic chemists. Studying the biosynthesis of remarkable chemical functionality often reveals unprecedented enzymatic reactivity that may be further applied in combinatorial biosyn-thesis and metabolic engineering.1 Unique natural product structures also inspire the development of new methodology and strategies for chemical synthesis.2 The cylindrocyclophanes are a family of cytotoxic natural products from photosynthetic cyanobacteria that contain a highly unusual [7.7]paracyclophane ring system.3 This scaffold is unique among natural products, and the biochemical transformations involved in its assembly are currently unknown. Here we report the identification of a gene cluster from the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermum licheniforme that is involved in cylindrocyclophane production. Using a combination of in vitro enzyme characterization and feeding studies, we have discovered that assembly of the paracyclophane macrocycle employs unusual biosynthetic logic, including functionalization of an unactivated carbon center. Moore et al. reported the isolation and structural character-ization of cylindrocyclophanes A-F in the early 1990s (Figure 1A).3a,b Subsequent feeding experiments suggested a unique biosynthetic pathway for constructing the [7.7]paracyclophane skeleton (Figure 1B). The symmetric labeling pattern resulting from acetate incorporation revealed the polyketide origin of these natural products and led Bobzin andMoore to hypothesize that their biosynthesis involved a C-C bond-forming, head-to-tail dimerization reaction of an alkyl resorcinol intermediate (Figure 1C).4 This type of tailoring event, which constructs two sp2-sp3 C-C linkages and two stereocenters, has limited precedent among biological transformations.5 Though feeding experiments did not provide insight into the exact structure of the monomeric precursor, Bobzin andMoore proposed that the C7/ C20 position was pre-functionalized for eventual C-C bond formation during monomer construction on a polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly line. The unusual molecular framework of the cylindrocyclophanes has inspired several elegant total syntheses.6 Though synthetic chemists have recognized and admired the complexity-generating power of the proposed biosynthetic route to the [7.7]paracyclophane skeleton, no chemical synthesis to date has been able to exploit this disconnection. Understanding cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis at the molecular level should therefore not only reveal new enzymatic reactions and biosynthetic logic but also inspire chemists seeking to emulate the elegance of Nature\u2019s synthetic approach. Our strategy for locating the cylindrocyclophane biosynthetic gene cluster involved whole genome sequencing followed by bioinformatic searches for specific gene products likely to be involved in natural product assembly. In addition to confirming the polyketide nature of the cylindrocyclophanes, the original Received: August 21, 2012 Published: October 29, 2012 Figure 1. The cylindrocyclophane family of natural products and feeding studies revealed an acetate-derived \u03b2-methyl group within the backbone of cylindrocyclophanes A-F (Figure 1B).4 This relatively unusual structural feature is introduced into polyketide scaffolds using a highly conserved pathway containing an enzyme homologous to hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase (Figure 2A).7 Reasoning that a closely related enzyme should be involved in cylindrocyclophane assembly, we used degenerate PCR to amplify putative HMG-CoA synthase homologs from genomic DNA of C. licheniforme ATCC 29412, a producer of cylindrocyclophanes A-F.3b,8 A 636 bp PCR product was obtained, and its translated sequence revealed close homology (92 and 90% identity at the amino acid level) to JamH and CurD, cyanobacterial HMG-CoA synthases involved in \u03b2-Me installation during jamaicamide9 and curacin10 biosynthesis (Figure S1). Because genes responsible for natural product assembly in microbes are typically co-localized, we hypothesized that the C. licheniforme HMG-CoA synthase fragment should be clustered with additional genes involved in cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis. Searches for this nucleotide sequence in C. licheniforme genome sequence data generated by 454 pyrosequencing revealed an identical sequence on contig 1024. In addition to a full-length HMG-CoA synthase homolog, this 12.1 kb genome fragment contained additional open reading frames (ORFs) hypothesized to encode enzymes possessing functions consistent with involvement in cylindrocyclophane assembly, including a PKS and other enzymes involved in \u03b2-Me installation. Searches for the remaining genes associated with addition of this substituent identified two more contigs connected to cylin-drocyclophane biosynthesis (111 and 112).11 We confirmed the proximities of all three contigs by sequencing regions of the genome spanning adjacent contigs, permitting assembly of a single gene cluster. The putative cylindrocyclophane (cyl) biosynthetic gene cluster contains 12 ORFs (Figure 2B), including genes encoding the enzymatic machinery required for installing the \u03b2-Me substituent (cylE, F, G, H). The cluster also has two distinct types of PKS machinery, a short type I modular PKS assembly line (cylD, H) and a type III PKS (cylI). Two additional genes, predicted fatty acid adenylating enzyme cylA and freestanding acyl carrier protein (ACP) cylB, likely produce enzymes involved in initiating biosynthesis. The remaining ORFs include homologs of a phospholipid methyl-transferase (cylJ), a predicted flavin-dependent oxidoreductase (cylL), a protein with a hemolysin-like binding region (cylK), and a hypothetical protein (cylC). Detailed annotation of the cluster (Table S1) revealed all of the enzymatic reactivity necessary for biosynthesis of a putative cylindrocyclophane monomeric precursor (8) and enabled us to generate a detailed hypothesis for its assembly (Figure 2C). One of the most striking and unexpected features of the cyl gene cluster is the abbreviated nature of the type I PKS assembly line. CylD and CylH contain just two intact modules and are therefore expected to perform only two elongation reactions. Iterative function of these enzymes is unlikely as they both lack all of the domains needed to form the fully reduced polyketide backbone found in the final natural products. Given the size and structures of the cylindrocyclophanes, we propose that biosyn-thesis originates with recruitment of a free fatty acid. Activation of decanoic acid by CylA and loading onto CylB to form thioester 7 could be followed by transfer to the first type I PKS CylD. This PKS contains ketosynthase (KS) and acyltransferase (AT) domains along with two tandem ACP domains, an arrangement that is often associated with the \u03b2-Me group modification.7 We hypothesize that CylD performs one elongation with malonyl-CoA and the resulting \u03b2-ketothioester is further processed by CylE, F, and G, which are predicted to catalyze addition of acetate to the \u03b2-ketone and dehydration to form an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated thioester intermediate. We were unable to locate a candidate freestanding ACP for use in \u03b2-Me installation but noted that the second ACP domain on CylD is most closely related in sequence to freestanding ACPs of this type, perhaps indicating that it fills this role. The final two enzymatic activities needed to complete construction of the chiral \u03b2-Me substituent are encoded as domains on the second type I PKS CylH. CylH contains enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) and enoylreductase (ER) domains, which should catalyze decarboxylation and reduction of the CylD product.7 The additional KS, AT, ACP, and thioesterase (TE) domains of CylH constitute another PKS module and should catalyze a second elongation with malonyl-CoA. Interestingly, multiple sequence alignments of the CylH TE domain with TE domains from characterized type I PKS assembly lines indicate that it may lack a conserved catalytic aspartate residue and could therefore be non-functional.12 We propose that type III PKS CylI terminates the assembly line by utilizing the CylH-bound \u03b2-ketothioester as a starter unit for aromatic ring formation. Type III PKSs typically use CoA Figure 2.Discovery of the cyl gene cluster and proposed biosynthesis of the cylindrocyclophanes.

Soc. 2012, 134, 18518-1852118519 thioesters as substrates and catalyze successive Claisen condensations, cyclization of the resulting polyketide inter-mediate, and aromatization. The action of CylI on the nascent product of the CylD-CylH assembly line could generate the resorcinol-type aromatic ring found in the cylindrocyclophanes. Overall, the PKS machinery encoded by this biosynthetic gene cluster is consistent with its role in cylindrocyclophane assembly. We solidified the link between the cyl gene cluster and cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis by characterizing the activities of several of the encoded enzymes in vitro. Specifically, we examined CylA and CylB, the enzymes predicted to be involved in fatty acid recruitment, and CylI, the type III PKS. CylA, CylB, and CylI were individually cloned from C. licheniforme, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified. The ability of CylA to activate and load decanoic acid onto holo-CylB was probed using both HPLC and LC-MS (Figure 3A). Incubation of holo-CylB with decanoic acid, CylA, and ATP resulted in formation of the anticipated decanoyl-CylB thioester. This activity was dependent on the presence of both ATP andCylA. CylA was not able to load decanoyl-CoA onto holo-CylB, which suggests that CylA is a fatty acyl-AMP ligase rather than a fatty acyl-CoA ligase (Figure S8). The size selectivity of this fatty acid activation and loading process was evaluated using an LC-MS-based competition assay. Incubating CylA and holo-CylB with equal amounts of C6, C8, C10, C12, and C14 saturated fatty acids resulted in highly selective formation of decanoyl-CylB thioester (Figure 3B). We observed only a small amount (<10%) of product derived from octanoic acid. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that CylA and CylB are capable of recruiting decanoic acid for cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis in a size-selective manner. This exquisite selectivity is consistent with the observation that all members of the cylindrocyclophane natural product family share the same core carbon skeleton. Activation of a free fatty acid for use as a starter unit is rare among type I modular PKS assembly lines but has been demonstrated previously in the biosynthesis of mycobacte-rial fatty acids13 and several hybrid PKS/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase systems.9,14 Having confirmed that the in vitro activities of enzymes involved in initiating cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis supported our biosynthetic hypothesis, we next explored the chemistry underlying assembly line termination. Evaluating the reactivity of type III PKS CylI required accessing a suitable substrate via chemical synthesis. We hypothesized that CylI would catalyze formation of a resorcinol-type aromatic ring via reaction of an ACP-tethered \u03b2-ketothioester intermediate with two molecules of malonyl-CoA (Scheme S1). We synthesized an N-acetylcyst-amine (NAC) thioester analog (9) of the proposed CylI substrate and evaluated its reactivity in the presence of CylI and malonyl-CoA. A single new product peak was observed byHPLC (Figure 4); isolation of this product from a large-scale enzymatic reaction and characterization using NMR (1H, 13C) and HRMS confirmed formation of resorcinol 8. The enzymatically synthesized material was identical in all respects to a product standard prepared via chemical synthesis. The reactivity of type III PKS CylI supports its proposed role in cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis, terminating a type I modular PKS assembly line in a highly unusual fashion via aromatic ring formation. While a few type III PKS enzymes and domains have been reported to accept acyl-ACP substrates generated by iterative type I15 and type II16 fatty acid synthases, to our knowledge CylI is the first type III PKS predicted to utilize an acyl-ACP substrate from a modular assembly line. The in vitro characterization of CylA, CylB, and CylI connects the cyl gene cluster to assembly of an alkyl resorcinol intermediate that could be a monomeric precursor to the cylindrocyclophanes. To further confirm that the fatty acid activation pathway encoded by this cluster is directly connected to cylindrocyclophane production, we performed feeding studies with C. licheniforme, evaluating incorporation of isotopically labeled precursors into the cylindrocyclophane skeleton using LC-MS of culture extracts. Feeding of d19-decanoic acid produced both d18-and d36-cylindrocyclophane F (Figure 5). The masses corresponding to these single and double incorporation products were not found in extracts from cultures fed with unlabeled decanoic acid. Interestingly, the double incorporation product predominates, which may indicate that synthesis of a monomeric precursor and dimerization are tightly coupled, a hypothesis that is consistent with our inability to locate masses of putative monomeric intermediates in culture extracts. Overall, the results of this feeding experiment verify that Figure 3. In vitro characterization of CylA and CylB. (A) HPLC assay decanoic acid is a biosynthetic precursor to the cylindrocyclo-phanes and is assimilated into both halves of the natural product skeleton. It also confirms that the eventual C7/C20 carbon atom of the paracyclophane scaffold enters the biosynthetic pathway as an unactivated methylene group. Construction of this unique macrocyclic architecture therefore requires a C-H functionaliza-tion event at some point in the biosynthetic pathway. One intriguing possibility for macrocycle formation is direct oxidative sp2-sp3 C-C bond-forming dimerization of 8 involving the resorcinol aromatic ring and the unactivated alkyl chain. A conceptually related transformation is utilized in the biosynthesis of the prodiginine alkaloid streptorubin B and has been linked to the activity of Reiske oxygenase RedG.5 Notably, no RedG homolog is found in the cyl cluster or in the C. licheniforme genome sequencing data. If cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis does employ direct oxidative C-C bond formation, it must therefore be carried out using distinct enzymatic chemistry. We hypothesize that one or more of the remaining enzymes encoded by the cyl cluster (CylC, CylJ-L) may be involved in paracyclophane formation, and the stage is now set to elucidate the details of this process through further biochemical characterization.17 In summary, we have obtained the first molecular insights into the biosynthesis of the cylindrocyclophanes through identi-fication of a biosynthetic gene cluster, in vitro characterization of biosynthetic enzymes, and feeding studies. Assembly of potential biosynthetic intermediate 8 involves a remarkable combination of polyketide biosynthetic machinery: size-selective recruitment of a fatty acid building block by CylA andCylB, elaboration of the fatty acid by a type I modular PKS, and termination of the assembly line by type III PKS CylI. This unusual initiation and off-loading logic could potentially be applied in combinatorial biosynthesis. Incorporation of labeled decanoic acid into the cylindrocyclophane skeleton in vivo confirmed the role of this metabolite in biosynthesis and established that assembly of the macrocycle involves functionalization of an unactivated carbon center. Elucidating the biosynthetic logic underlying para-cyclophane construction and tailoring, including the precise nature of the key C-C bond-forming event, are important future challenges that should enrich our understanding of how Nature constructs complex molecular architecture.

        "thioesters as substrates and catalyze successive Claisen condensations, cyclization of the resulting polyketide inter-mediate, and aromatization. The action of CylI on the nascent product of the CylD-CylH assembly line could generate the resorcinol-type aromatic ring found in the cylindrocyclophanes. Overall, the PKS machinery encoded by this biosynthetic gene cluster is consistent with its role in cylindrocyclophane assembly.",
        "We solidified the link between the cyl gene cluster and cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis by characterizing the activities of several of the encoded enzymes in vitro. Specifically, we examined CylA and CylB, the enzymes predicted to be involved in fatty acid recruitment, and CylI, the type III PKS. CylA, CylB, and CylI were individually cloned from C. licheniforme, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified. The ability of CylA to activate and load decanoic acid onto holo-CylB was probed using both HPLC and LC-MS (Figure 3A). Incubation of holo-CylB",
        "with decanoic acid, CylA, and ATP resulted in formation of the anticipated decanoyl-CylB thioester. This activity was dependent on the presence of both ATP andCylA. CylA was not able to load decanoyl-CoA onto holo-CylB, which suggests that CylA is a fatty acyl-AMP ligase rather than a fatty acyl-CoA ligase (Figure S8). The size selectivity of this fatty acid activation and loading process was evaluated using an LC-MS-based competition assay. Incubating CylA and holo-CylB with equal amounts of C6, C8, C10, C12, and C14 saturated fatty acids resulted in highly selective formation of decanoyl-CylB thioester (Figure 3B). We observed only a small amount (<10%) of product derived from octanoic acid. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that CylA and CylB are capable of recruiting decanoic acid for cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis in a size-selective manner. This exquisite selectivity is consistent with the observation that all members of the cylindrocyclophane natural product family share the same core carbon skeleton. Activation of a free fatty acid for use as a starter unit is rare among type I modular PKS assembly lines but has been demonstrated previously in the biosynthesis of mycobacte-rial fatty acids13 and several hybrid PKS/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase systems.9,14",
        "Having confirmed that the in vitro activities of enzymes involved in initiating cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis supported our biosynthetic hypothesis, we next explored the chemistry underlying assembly line termination. Evaluating the reactivity of type III PKS CylI required accessing a suitable substrate via chemical synthesis. We hypothesized that CylI would catalyze formation of a resorcinol-type aromatic ring via reaction of an ACP-tethered \u03b2-ketothioester intermediate with two molecules of malonyl-CoA (Scheme S1). We synthesized an N-acetylcyst-amine (NAC) thioester analog (9) of the proposed CylI substrate and evaluated its reactivity in the presence of CylI and malonyl-CoA. A single new product peak was observed byHPLC (Figure 4); isolation of this product from a large-scale enzymatic",
        "reaction and characterization using NMR (1H, 13C) and HRMS confirmed formation of resorcinol 8. The enzymatically synthesized material was identical in all respects to a product standard prepared via chemical synthesis. The reactivity of type III PKS CylI supports its proposed role in cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis, terminating a type I modular PKS assembly line in a highly unusual fashion via aromatic ring formation. While a few type III PKS enzymes and domains have been reported to accept acyl-ACP substrates generated by iterative type I15 and type II16 fatty acid synthases, to our knowledge CylI is the first type III PKS predicted to utilize an acyl-ACP substrate from a modular assembly line.",
        "The in vitro characterization of CylA, CylB, and CylI connects the cyl gene cluster to assembly of an alkyl resorcinol intermediate that could be a monomeric precursor to the cylindrocyclophanes. To further confirm that the fatty acid activation pathway encoded by this cluster is directly connected to cylindrocyclophane production, we performed feeding studies with C. licheniforme, evaluating incorporation of isotopically labeled precursors into the cylindrocyclophane skeleton using LC-MS of culture extracts. Feeding of d19-decanoic acid produced both d18-and d36-cylindrocyclophane F (Figure 5).",
        "The masses corresponding to these single and double incorporation products were not found in extracts from cultures fed with unlabeled decanoic acid. Interestingly, the double incorporation product predominates, which may indicate that synthesis of a monomeric precursor and dimerization are tightly coupled, a hypothesis that is consistent with our inability to locate masses of putative monomeric intermediates in culture extracts. Overall, the results of this feeding experiment verify that",
        "Figure 3. In vitro characterization of CylA and CylB. (A) HPLC assay",
        "decanoic acid is a biosynthetic precursor to the cylindrocyclo-phanes and is assimilated into both halves of the natural product skeleton. It also confirms that the eventual C7/C20 carbon atom of the paracyclophane scaffold enters the biosynthetic pathway as an unactivated methylene group. Construction of this unique macrocyclic architecture therefore requires a C-H functionaliza-tion event at some point in the biosynthetic pathway.",
        "One intriguing possibility for macrocycle formation is direct oxidative sp2-sp3 C-C bond-forming dimerization of 8 involving the resorcinol aromatic ring and the unactivated alkyl chain. A conceptually related transformation is utilized in the biosynthesis of the prodiginine alkaloid streptorubin B and has been linked to the activity of Reiske oxygenase RedG.5 Notably, no RedG homolog is found in the cyl cluster or in the C. licheniforme genome sequencing data. If cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis does employ direct oxidative C-C bond formation, it must therefore be carried out using distinct enzymatic chemistry. We hypothesize that one or more of the remaining enzymes encoded by the cyl cluster (CylC, CylJ-L) may be involved in paracyclophane formation, and the stage is now set to elucidate the details of this process through further biochemical characterization.17",
        "In summary, we have obtained the first molecular insights into the biosynthesis of the cylindrocyclophanes through identi-fication of a biosynthetic gene cluster, in vitro characterization of biosynthetic enzymes, and feeding studies. Assembly of potential biosynthetic intermediate 8 involves a remarkable combination of polyketide biosynthetic machinery: size-selective recruitment of a fatty acid building block by CylA andCylB, elaboration of the fatty acid by a type I modular PKS, and termination of the assembly line by type III PKS CylI. This unusual initiation and off-loading logic could potentially be applied in combinatorial biosynthesis. Incorporation of labeled decanoic acid into the cylindrocyclophane skeleton in vivo confirmed the role of this metabolite in biosynthesis and established that assembly of the macrocycle involves functionalization of an unactivated carbon center. Elucidating the biosynthetic logic underlying para-cyclophane construction and tailoring, including the precise nature of the key C-C bond-forming event, are important future challenges that should enrich our understanding of how Nature constructs complex molecular architecture.",

This observed toxicity does provide a possible explanation for tight coupling of monomer generation and macrocyclization.",
