Herein, we report the biosyntheticlogic of their construction in Streptomyces sp. CNH-287 based on the identification of thechlorizidine A biosynthetic gene cluster. Using whole pathway heterologous expression andgenetic manipulations, we show that chlorizidine A is assembled by a polyketide synthase thatuniquely incorporates a fatty acid synthase-derived dichloropyrrolyl extender unit into thepyrroloisoindolone enzymatic product. We further provide the first biochemical characterizationof a flavoenzyme associated with the oxidative formation of chlorizidine A\u2019s distinctivepyrrolizine ring. This work illuminates new enzymatic assembly line processes to rare nitrogen-containing rings in nature.Polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes construct their remarkable collection of chemicalproducts chiefly from malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA substrates.1,2 Recently, a newmetabolic pathway has emerged for the elaboration of assorted PKS extender units derivedfrom \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acyl-CoA substrates.3 Their reductive carboxylation by enzymesbelonging to the crotonyl-CoA reductase/carboxylase (CCR) family yields \u03b1-substitutedmalonyl-CoA molecules that transfer their unique side chain chemistry to polyketidebackbones. Despite displaying diversity in carbon chain length, CCR-derived extender unitsthus far have consisted of linear and branched-chain alkylmalonyl-CoA substrates derivedmostly from fatty acid metabolism.4,5 Herein, we report the unanticipated pathway forchlorizidine A (1) biosynthesis, which involves a dedicated fatty acid synthase (FAS) for theconstruction of a dichloropyrrole intermediate that is further oxidized, activated andincorporated into a PKS pathway to yield a bicyclic pyrrolizine ring.Chlorizidine A is a tetrachlorinated alkaloid recently isolated from the marine bacteriumStreptomyces sp. CNH-287.6 Its novel structure contains a 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-onering system not previously observed in a natural product connected through a single C\u2013Cbond to a dichlorinated 1H-pyrrolizine.

While the biosynthesis of 2 and 3involves a C7\u2013C12 aldol condensation of a linear polyketide intermediate, the constructionof 1 was unclear, thereby motivating us to explore the molecular logic of its assembly.Hughes and co-workers6 proposed the participation of two distinct PKS systems that usedichloropyrrolyl-S-carrier protein (4) to generate polyketide intermediates terminating at C8and C12 within 1 that combine intermolecularly to form the pyrroloisoindolone ring. We, onthe other hand, suspected an alternative mechanism in which the tricyclic ring forms via aC6\u2013C11 aldol cyclization of a single polyketide intermediate (Figure 1). Such a scenario,however, would necessitate the attachment of the pyrrolizine unit to C9 via an unknownreaction mechanism.To clarify the strategy employed by nature in the structural diversification ofdichloropyrrole-based natural products, we screened a genomic DNA library ofStreptomyces sp. CNH-287 and identified a fosmid clone containing genes homologous tothose associated with 4 biosynthesis.7,8 Next generation sequencing of the selected fosmidrevealed a contiguous region of 42.4 kb containing 26 open reading frames (ORFs) (Figure2). Targeted integration of the redesigned fosmid9 into the genome of Streptomycescoelicolor M512 imparted this surrogate strain the ability to produce 1, confirming that theidentified gene cluster is sufficient for the biosynthesis of chlorizidine A. As such wedesignated the genes clz1\u201326 (Table S1).Bioinformatic analysis of the clz genes revealed that clz5, clz15, clz16 and clz19 arehomologous to those involved with the similar construction of the dichloropyrroleintermediate 4 as previously observed in 2 and 3 biosynthesis. Further inspection of the clzlocus identified a trimodular PKS encoded by clz6 and clz7 that is predicted to incorporatetwo malonate units by modules 1 and 3 and an \u03b1-branched malonate in module.4 No otherPKS-encoding genes were present in the clz cluster, thereby suggesting that 1 is notassembled from the condensation of two distinct polyketide molecules.6 Rather weidentified an acyl carrier protein (ACP), gene clz10, overlapping with a FAS gene clz11 thatencode FabC and FabF homologues, respectively. FabF enzymes are known to catalyzeiterative condensation of an acyl-ACP substrate with malonyl-ACPs to generate \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP molecules that get reduced each cycle in three steps by ketoreductase, dehydratase andenoyl-reductase enzymes.10 Since none of the three Clz6/7 PKS modules contain reductivedomains, we hypothesized that the pyrrolizine moiety may originate in a parallel FASpathway involving two consecutive malonate extensions of 4 to yield the ACP-tetheredintermediates 5 and 6 after full reductive cycles catalyzed by primary metabolic FASenzymes (Figure 2). Additional type II FAS-based genes encoded in the clz locus include anenoyl-ACP-reductase (clz3) and a CCR (clz4) with low sequence identity with knownenzymes. We thus envisaged that the unsaturated intermediate 7 is formed by Clz3 oxidationto facilitate its reductive carboxylation by the Clz4 CCR to give the dichloropyrrolo-substituted malonate 8 for assimilation into the main polyketide chain by Clz6 AT-2 (Figure2). To explore this sequence-based hypothesis, we generated a series of mutants in which wedeleted targeted clz genes by \u03bb-Red recombination.11 As expected, inactivation of the FAD-dependent halogenase clz5 and the PKS gene clz6 abolished the production of 1. In the caseof the clz6 deletion mutant, we further observed the accumulation of a new dichlorinatedmolecule (5a). On the basis of high-resolution MS (m/z 205.9780, calculated 205.9781,C7H5NO2Cl2) and MS2 fragmentation data that clearly revealed decarboxylated (m/z 147)and dichloromethylpyrrole (m/z 162) fragments (Figure S5), 5a is the hydrolyzed product ofprotein-bound 5. This series of experiments not only confirmed the central importance of theMantovani and MoorePage 2J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 December 04.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript Clz5 halogenase and the Clz6 PKS in chlorizidine biosynthesis, but it also supported ourhypothesis that the dichloropyrrole intermediate 4 is additionally chain extended by asynthase other than the PKS.We next turned our attention to the fatty acid biosynthesis genes suspected in the proposedpathway to 8. Gene inactivation of the FabF KS clz11 significantly decreased the productionof 1 by approximately 90%, while deletion of clz11 and the coupled ACP clz10 furtherreduced production to just trace levels (Figure S2 and S3). We did not detect theaccumulation of additional chlorinated compounds such as 5 in either case. These dataconfirmed the importance of the fatty acid pathway to 1 biosynthesis and suggested, to oursurprise, that the S. coelicolor host can partially complement the native chlorizidine FASpathway. Clz10 and Clz11 are homologous with the S. coelicolor genes SCO2389 (FabC,49% identity) and SCO2390 (FabF, 53% identity). While the utilization of diverse starterunits by PKSs is greatly appreciated,1,12 there are precious few examples of FASs primedwith exotic precursors such as 4.13 The interaction of Clz11 with the ACPs Clz10 and Clz18may have an important role in catalyzing the extension of 4.14Inactivation of the enoyl-ACP-reductase clz3 and the putative CCR clz4 similarly abolished1 while resulting in the accumulation of 5a (Figure S5). Further analysis of extracts of the\u0394clz4 mutant revealed the accumulation of a second dichlorinated species (7a, m/z 231.9937,calculated 231.9938, C9H7NO2Cl2). As with 5a, we measured decarboxylated (m/z 188) anddichloromethylpyrrole (m/z 147) MS fragments consistent with the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturatedcarboxylic acid derivative of protein-bound 7 (Figure S6). To exclude potential polar effectson expression of the downstream genes in the mutants, we reintroduced the deleted genesclz3 and clz4 back to the deficient mutants through conjugation. In each case, the productionof 1 was restored with loss of 5a and 7a (Figure S4). These data further support our proposalthat 4 primes both the type I PKS Clz6 and the type II FAS Clz11.Further evidence for the proposed chlorizidine pathway was achieved with thecharacterization of the oxidoreductase gene clz9 and its flavoprotein product. Its geneticdisruption led to the formation of a new metabolite, compound 10, which we isolated at ~5mg/L. Inspection of its HR-MS supported a molecular formula of C18H12N2O3Cl4 (m/z442.9532, calculated 442.9529) which differed by one degree of unsaturation compared to 1.NMR spectroscopic analysis clearly revealed that the dichlorinated 1H-pyrrolizine ringsystem of 1 was absent in 7 while the 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-one ring system remainedintact. We observed three contiguous methylene groups that connected a dichloropyrroleresidue to the tricyclic alkaloid suggesting that the Clz9 flavoprotein catalyzes the finalbiosynthetic reaction to form the pyrrolizine ring.Clz9 is annotated as a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-linked oxidase containing theberberine bridge enzyme (BBE) sequence motif by BLAST analysis. Such enzymescharacteristically bind the flavin cofactor bicovalently in the enzyme active site. Sequencealignment of Clz9 with other well-characterized BBE family members confirmed theconserved active site histidine and cysteine residues at positions 99 and 157, respectively,necessary for bicovalent FAD attachment (Figure S6).15,16 We prepared recombinant Clz9fused to a maltose binding protein to facilitate its purification. Upon incubation with 10, weshowed the time-dependent conversion to 1, thereby confirming Clz9 as a new member ofthe BBE family with a novel enzymatic activity (Figure 3). The optical rotation ofenzymatically produced 1 agreed with the value reported for natural (S)-1, therebyconfirming Clz9\u2019s functional role in catalyzing the stereoselective cyclization of 10(prechlorizidine A) to 1.Mantovani and MoorePage 3J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 December 04.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript Enzymes containing bicovalently attached flavin cofactors have been reported inbiosynthetic pathways of alkaloids,16 terpenes,17 and carbohydrates18 primarily of plantorigin. These enzymes often function as oxidases that transfer hydride from the substrate tothe flavin cofactor to generate reactive intermediates prone to nucleophilic chemistry. In thecase of 1\u2019s pyrrolizine ring, its formation is achieved by the creation of a new C\u2013N bondbetween 10\u2019s pyrrole nitrogen and the benzylic carbon C13. We propose a mechanisminspired by other BBE members16,17 in Scheme 1. The formation of the pyrrolizine residuein 1 is biosynthetically distinct from well-known plant pyrrolizine natural products thatrather derive from homospermidine19. Structural and mechanistic details of Clz9\u2019sbiochemistry are presently underway and will be reported in due course.Based on the confirmed structure of 10 and its biosynthetic intermediacy, we propose thatthe pyrrolisoindolone core polyketide is formed upon release from Clz7 via anintramolecular condensation reaction involving the terminal thioester reductase domain(Figure 2). No other orphan oxidases are encoded in the clz cluster to alternatively supportthis function. Thioester reductase domains that catalyze intramolecular condensationreactions have been reported in several other microbial biosynthetic pathways20 and canexplain the different cyclization pattern observed for 1 biosynthesis (Figure 1). Mutationalstudies regarding the active site residues of the reductive domain are undergoing.In conclusion, we successfully characterized the genetic basis for chlorizidine Abiosynthesis to reveal a series of unexpected biochemical reactions. Our proposed PKSincorporation of a dichloropyrrole-containing extender unit is unprecedented and extendsCCR-based PKS building blocks into new chemical space that portends future polyketidebioengineering. Recently, the discovery of new pyrrolomycin derivatives21 containing linearfatty acid substituents suggests a similar CCR-based biogenesis in their construction. Thefurther post-PKS tailoring of prechlorizidine A\u2019s acyl pyrrole side chain to form chlorizidineA\u2019s pyrrolizine heterocycle not only reveals a new function for a flavin-dependent BBE, butalso uniquely expands post-PKS tailoring reactions to include alkaloid synthesis.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Acknowledgments We kindly thank W.

Additional type II FAS-based genes encoded in the clz locus include anenoyl-ACP-reductase (clz3) and a CCR (clz4) with low sequence identity with knownenzymes. We thus envisaged that the unsaturated intermediate 7 is formed by Clz3 oxidationto facilitate its reductive carboxylation by the Clz4 CCR to give the dichloropyrrolo-substituted malonate 8 for assimilation into the main polyketide chain by Clz6 AT-2 (Figure2).",
        "To explore this sequence-based hypothesis, we generated a series of mutants in which wedeleted targeted clz genes by \u03bb-Red recombination.11 As expected, inactivation of the FAD-dependent halogenase clz5 and the PKS gene clz6 abolished the production of 1. In the caseof the clz6 deletion mutant, we further observed the accumulation of a new dichlorinatedmolecule (5a). On the basis of high-resolution MS (m/z 205.9780, calculated 205.9781,C7H5NO2Cl2) and MS2 fragmentation data that clearly revealed decarboxylated (m/z 147)and dichloromethylpyrrole (m/z 162) fragments (Figure S5), 5a is the hydrolyzed product ofprotein-bound 5. This series of experiments not only confirmed the central importance of",

        "PKS.We next turned our attention to the fatty acid biosynthesis genes suspected in the proposedpathway to 8. Gene inactivation of the FabF KS clz11 significantly decreased the productionof 1 by approximately 90%, while deletion of clz11 and the coupled ACP clz10 furtherreduced production to just trace levels (Figure S2 and S3). We did not detect theaccumulation of additional chlorinated compounds such as 5 in either case. These dataconfirmed the importance of the fatty acid pathway to 1 biosynthesis and suggested, to oursurprise, that the S. coelicolor host can partially complement the native chlorizidine FASpathway. Clz10 and Clz11 are homologous with the S. coelicolor genes SCO2389 (FabC,49% identity) and SCO2390 (FabF, 53% identity). While the utilization of diverse starterunits by PKSs is greatly appreciated,1,12 there are precious few examples of FASs primedwith exotic precursors such as 4.13 The interaction of Clz11 with the ACPs Clz10 and Clz18may have an important role in catalyzing the extension of",
        "4.14Inactivation of the enoyl-ACP-reductase clz3 and the putative CCR clz4 similarly abolished1 while resulting in the accumulation of 5a (Figure S5). Further analysis of extracts of the\u0394clz4 mutant revealed the accumulation of a second dichlorinated species (7a, m/z 231.9937,calculated 231.9938, C9H7NO2Cl2). As with 5a, we measured decarboxylated (m/z 188) anddichloromethylpyrrole (m/z 147) MS fragments consistent with the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturatedcarboxylic acid derivative of protein-bound 7 (Figure S6). To exclude potential polar effectson expression of the downstream genes in the mutants, we reintroduced the deleted genesclz3 and clz4 back to the deficient mutants through conjugation. In each case, the productionof 1 was restored with loss of 5a and 7a (Figure S4). These data further support our proposalthat 4 primes both the type I PKS Clz6 and the type II FAS",

No other orphan oxidases are encoded in the clz cluster to alternatively supportthis function. Thioester reductase domains that catalyze intramolecular condensationreactions have been reported in several other microbial biosynthetic pathways20 and canexplain the different cyclization pattern observed for 1 biosynthesis (Figure 1).

Our proposed PKSincorporation of a dichloropyrrole-containing extender unit is unprecedented and extendsCCR-based PKS building blocks into new chemical space that portends future polyketidebioengineering. Recently, the discovery of new pyrrolomycin derivatives21 containing linearfatty acid substituents suggests a similar CCR-based biogenesis in their construction. Thefurther post-PKS tailoring of prechlorizidine A\u2019s acyl pyrrole side chain to form chlorizidineA\u2019s pyrrolizine heterocycle not only reveals a new function for a flavin-dependent BBE, butalso uniquely expands post-PKS tailoring reactions to include alkaloid",
