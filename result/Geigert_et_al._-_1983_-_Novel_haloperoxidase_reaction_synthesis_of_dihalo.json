NEIDLEMAN, DEMETRIOS J. DALIETOS, AND SUSANNE K. DEWITT Cetus Corporation, Berkeley, California 94710 Received 17 January 1983/Accepted 3 March 1983 The enzymatic synthesis of vicinal, dihalogenated products from alkenes and alkynes is described. The enzymatic reaction required an alkene or alkyne, dilute hydrogen peroxide, a haloperoxidase, and molar amounts of halide ions. Vicinal dichloro, dibromo, and diiodo products could be formed. A hydroxyl group on the carbon adjacent to the carbon-carbon double or triple bond lowered the halide ion concentration needed to produce the dihalo product. This reaction offers one explanation for the origin of natural, vicinal, dihalogenated products, such as those found frequently in marine microogranisms. Haloperoxidase enzymes have been found in various sources, including the fungus Caldario-myces fumago (9) and numerous marine algae (6). In the course of our studies on novel enzy-matic reactions of haloperoxidases, we discov-ered that these enyzmes catalyze the formation of a,4-halohydrins from alkenes and the forma-tion of a-halogenated ketones from alkynes (5, 5a) (Fig. 1). These and earlier haloperoxidase reactions were run in halide concentrations below 100 mM (3, 7, 10). It was not obvious that haloperoxi-dases produce different halogenated products in the presence of higher concentrations of halide ions. We now report the formation of vicinal, dihalogenated products from alkenes and al-kynes in haloperoxidase reactions run in high (s 2,000 mM) concentrations of halide ions. MATERAILS AND METHODS Haloperoxidases. Chloroperoxidase (CPO; from C. fumago; 107 U/ml, as measured by the monochlorodi-medon assay) and lactoperoxidase (LPO; from milk; 500 U/ml, as measured by the pyrogallol assay) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. LPO is a bromoperoxidase. Substrates and product standards. Propylene and methyl acetylene were purchased from Matheson Gas Products, Lyndhurst, N.J. Allyl alcohol, allyl chloride, 1-bromo-2-propanol, 3-buten-1-ol, 3-butyn-1-ol, 1-chloro-2-propanol, 1,2-di-bromopropane, 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol, 1,2-dichloro-propane, 2,3-dichloro-1-propanol, 4-penten-1-ol, and propargyl alcohol were purchased from Aldrich Chem-ical Co., Milwaukee, Wis., and Pfaltz and Bauer, Inc., Stamford, Conn. Enzymatic reactions. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature in 100-ml Pyrex flasks equipped with a magnetic stir bar and stirrer. Each mixture contained 400 ,ul of haloperoxidase, potassium halide, and 10 ml of 300 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 3.0 (for CPO) or 6.0 (for LPO). The concentration of potassium halide in the reaction mix-ture was varied from 20 to 2,000 mM. The gaseous substrates were slowly (10 ml/min) and continuously bubbled through the mixture during the reaction. For the liquid substrates, the concentration was 20 mM at the start of the reaction. Hydrogen peroxide was the last reagent added (final concentra-tion, 30 mM). After initiation, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min. All reactions were run at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Reactions were not neces-sarily run under optimized conditions, nor were reac-tions run until completion of substrate conversion. No products were detected in controls (without added enzyme). Reaction mixture analysis. Aliquots (10 ,ul) of reac-tion mixtures were injected into a Finnigan 4021 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer equipped with a coiled glass column (1.8 m by 4 mm) packed with Tenax-GC (80/100 mesh). The carrier gas was helium, which was set at 25 ml/min. For rapid analysis of the many different reaction mixtures, the column tempera-ture was programmed from 100\u00b0C at a rate of 10\u00b0C/min and then held at 250\u00b0C for 20 min, and the injector and jet separator temperatures were set at 260\u00b0C. The mass spectrometer was operated in electron impact mode at 70 eV. The mass range from m/z 40 to 400 was scanned every 2 s. Confirmation of the identity of the reaction products was made by determining gas chromatograph retention time and comparing mass spectra with those of avail-able authentic standards. Halohydrin positional iso-mers were not individually quantitated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Although the mechanism of haloperoxidase reaction is under debate (8, 11), free hypohalous acid generated by the enzyme has been implicat-ed in reactions on alkenes and alkynes. If this is true, then the first step in the reaction would be 1575 1576 GEIGERT ET AL.

Under normal enzymatic reaction conditions, the nucleophile hydroxy ion (OH-) reacts with the halonium ion intermediates to form ot,p-halohydrins and a-haloketones (Fig. 1). Howev-er, other nucleophiles, placed in a competitive advantage, could also react with the halonium ion intermediates. One way of giving a halide ion (X-) a competitive advantage is by flooding the reaction mixture with the nucleophile. This idea was tested with a variety of alkenes (Table 1).

The use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as the primary analytic tool permitted rapid and unambiguous assignment of the many products formed, as illustrated by the bromination of allyl alcohol by CPO (Fig. 3 through 6). Since the rate of product formation by haloperoxidase is a function of both substrate concentration and halide ion concentration (2), under high halide ion concentrations, some sub-strates yielded more product (e.g., allyl alcohol), and others yielded less (e.g., propylene). A hydroxyl group on the carbon adjacent to the carbon-carbon double bond dramatically in-creased the proportion of vicinal, dihalogenated product formed (Table 1). This enhancement was lost as the hydroxyl group was moved further away from the double bond (Table 2). A variety of alkynes were examined (Table 3), and the ratio of a-halogenated ketone product to vicinal, dihalogenated product was also found to be a function of halide ion concentration in the reaction mixture.

Therefore, controlling the product in the halo-peroxidase reaction by varying the halide ion concentration in the reaction mixture was dem-onstrated. These data on nucleophile competi-tiveness support the contention that halonium ion intermediates are involved in the reaction of haloperoxidase with alkenes and alkynes. Vicinal, dihalogenated products have been found in many marine algae, and it has been postulated that halonium ion intermediates are involved in their biosynthesis (4). The reactions reported above support this. Haloperoxidases are found in marine algae (6), and localized high concentrations of various halide ions in algae can occur because of the ability of the algae to concentrate the ions from seawater (1). Seawa-ter contains the necessary chloride ion concen-tration for production of dichlorinated metabo-lites: -540 mM Cl-. TABLE 3.

        "Therefore, controlling the product in the halo-peroxidase reaction by varying the halide ion concentration in the reaction mixture was dem-onstrated. These data on nucleophile competi-tiveness support the contention that halonium ion intermediates are involved in the reaction of haloperoxidase with alkenes and alkynes.",
        "Vicinal, dihalogenated products have been found in many marine algae, and it has been postulated that halonium ion intermediates are involved in their biosynthesis (4). The reactions reported above support this. Haloperoxidases are found in marine algae (6), and localized high concentrations of various halide ions in algae can occur because of the ability of the algae to concentrate the ions from seawater (1). Seawa-ter contains the necessary chloride ion concen-tration for production of dichlorinated metabo-lites: -540 mM Cl-.",
