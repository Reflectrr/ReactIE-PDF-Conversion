Herein, we use combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to decipher the mechanism of selective halogenation by SyrB2. Our QM/MM calculations show the presence of three Cl-FeIV-oxo isomers which interconvert, and only the one having its oxo ligand pointing toward the target C-H bond is active during the hydrogen atom abstraction (H-abstraction) process. The fate of the formed Cl-FeIII-OH/R\u2022 intermediate is determined by a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the Arg254 residue and the OH ligand of Cl-FeIII-OH. The hydrogen bond not only prevents the OH group from participating in the followup rebound step to form a hydroxylated product but also facilitates the isomerization of the Cl-FeIII-OH/R\u2022 intermediate so that the Cl is directed toward the alkyl radical. The role of Arg254 in regulating the selectivity of chlorination is further discussed and connected to the experimentally observed effect of mutations of Arg247 (Arg247Glu and Arg247Ala) in the related CurA halogenase. The Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutants of SyrB2 were investigated by MD simulations, and they were found to suppress the H-bonding interaction of Arg254 with Cl-FeIII-OH: this result is in accord with their experimentally observed suppressed chlorination activity. This novel mechanism highlights the role of the H-bonding interaction between the protein and a reaction intermediate.

INTRODUCTION Mononuclear nonheme iron enzymes catalyze a myriad of chemically challenging transformations, including C-H bond hydroxylation, heteroatom oxidation, desaturation, epoxidation, and halogenation, which are important for the biosynthesis and degradation of compounds in metabolic processes.1-7 Among these versatile enzymes, the specific family that requires FeII as a cofactor and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) as a cosubstrate to activate aliphatic compounds to their halogenated products is called \u03b1KG-dependent halogenases.8-13 As halogenated compounds are the precursors of many organometallic species in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds,14-16 unraveling the mechanisms of carbon-halogen bond formation is extremely important. Syringomycin biosynthesis enzyme 2 (SyrB2), found in the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae B301D,17 chlori-nates the \u03b3-carbon of L-threonine in the biosynthesis of a phytotoxin called syringomycin E.9 SyrB2 is a member of the \u03b1KG-dependent halogenase family. Recently, wild-type SyrB2 and the Ala118Gly mutant were also found to be able to perform C-N bond formation reactions by substituting the native halide ion with the nitrogenous anions N3 -and NO2 -.18,19 These results hint that the Cl is not by itself the cause of the selectivity of halogenation over hydroxylation, and they thereby underscore the need to understand why, unlike other similar enzymes, C-H activation does not end with hydroxylation. As shown in Figure 1a, the active site of substrate-free SyrB2 taken from the X-ray structure (PDB code 2FCT)20 contains a Received: December 12, 2015 Revised: March 3, 2016 Published: March 11, 2016 Research Article pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis \u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society 2694 DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.5b02825 ACS Catal. 2016, 6, 2694-2704 D ow nl oa de d vi a U N IV  IL L IN O IS  UR B A N A -C H A M PA IG N  on Ju ne  1, 202 2 at  22: 05 :0 5 (U T C ).

The native substrate L-Thr-S-SyrB1 is shown in Figure 1b, and the \u03b3-methyl group of the L-Thr moiety that is chlorinated in the catalytic cycle is highlighted in red. Scheme 1 displays the catalytic cycle of the SyrB2 halogenase which was proposed in previous experimental studies.9,19-29 The catalytic cycle is initiated by the binding of theO2molecule to the FeII center to form a ferric-superoxo species. Subsequently, the distal oxygen atom nucleophilically attacks the \u03b1KG ligand to form a peroxo-bridged FeIV species. The subsequent cleavage of the bridged O-O bond and the decarboxylation of \u03b1KG lead to the formation of a Cl-FeIV-oxo complex. Thereafter, a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the substrate L-Thr by the Cl-FeIV-oxo species to form an alkyl radical and an FeIII-OH complex. This is followed by a rebound reaction of the radical with the chlorine atom to generate the chlorinated product. A competitive hydroxylation reaction may occur via the rebound of the alkyl radical to the FeIII-OH group. The catalytic cycle finishes with the binding of another molecule of \u03b1KG and another molecule of the substrate to reproduce the resting ferrous reactant complex. Experimental and quantum mechanical (QM) investigations have been performed to gain insight into the selective halogenation by SyrB2, and various mechanistic explanations have been proposed on the basis of such studies.29-34 De Visser and Latifi have shown that the byproduct of CO2 from O2 activation shuttles the hydroxyl group of the FeIIIOH moiety away to prevent the occurrence of hydroxylation by forming bicarbonate.30 Kulik et al. proposed that chlorination following hydrogen atom abstraction (H-abstraction) is barrierless; therefore, the halogenases do not hydroxylate their substrates.31 Hillier et al. suggested that the predominant chlorination should be caused by the protonation of the hydroxo intermediate, which inhibits the hydroxylation reaction.32 Noack and Siegbahn proposed that the barriers for hydroxylation and halogenation by the biomimetic equivalent of SyrB2 are comparable.35 On the basis of a model study considering first-shell and some of the second-shell residues of the iron center of SyrB2, Borowski et al. found a carbon-radical intermediate that favors chlorination is generated by H-abstraction via a second oxoferryl species isomer, which has a lower barrier in H-abstraction than the original oxoferryl species. Furthermore, they proposed that the interchange of oxo and chloride ligands relative to their positions in the crystal structure could control the selectivity.33 Using nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) experi-ments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Wong et al. found that the oxoferryl species which has its FeIV-oxo bond perpendicular to the C-H bond of the native substrate L-Thr favors chlorination.34Moreover, experimental findings led to the proposal that the different positions of the methylene radical vis-a-\u0300vis the chlorine and hydroxyl ligands can lead to the different halogenation and hydroxylation reactivities not only for the native substrate but also for non-native substrates.19,25,36,37 Using DFT methods augmented with a Hubbard U correction, Kulik and Drennan found that the propensity of the native substrate toward halogenation is strongly dependent on deeper substrate delivery into the active site following H-abstraction.38 The above mechanistic proposals seem to be quite diverse. Furthermore, it was found that the halogenation/hydroxylation selectivity strongly depends on the protein environment. For Figure 1. (a) Active site of substrate-free halogenase SyrB2 (PDB example, as found by Blasiak et al.,20 Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutations completely suppress chlorination activity of the enzyme. As previous QM studies did not consider the complete protein environment of this enzymatic reaction, we deemed it necessary to carry out combined quantummechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)39-43 calculations and molecular dynam-ics (MD) studies to thoroughly decipher the mechanism of halogenation/hydroxylation selectivity by SyrB2. Indeed, QM/ MM studies of other nonheme enzymes, such as TauD,44 AlkB,45,46 and HEPD,47 have clearly and effectively elucidated the crucial influence of protein environments on complex enzymatic reactions. Herein, we started from the active species of FeIV-oxo, which has been experimentally characterized in many halogenases,11,25,34,36,48 to explore the selective mechanism of halogenation vs hydroxylation in SyrB2. As the crystal structure for the substrate\u2019s carrier protein SyrB1 is absent,20 we truncated the L-Thr substrate according to the strategy used in a previous study,33 as specified in Scheme 2. As will be demonstrated below, selectivity arises from the H-bonding interaction between the Arg254 residue and the OH ligand of the Cl-FeIII-OH species after H-abstraction. This H-bonding interaction prevents theOH group from participating in the followup rebound step and in a nutshell steers the reaction\u2019s outcome toward selective chlorination. 2. METHODS 2.1. Setup of the System. The system was first constructed using the oxoferryl species to model the H-abstraction process. The initial coordinates were taken from the X-ray crystal structure (PDB code 2FCT). Only chain A was kept in our study.20 The missing residues, Ile57-Ser58-Gly59-Gly60, in the inner protein were added by superimposing 2FCT on another crystal structure20 (PDB code 2FCU, chain A) to determine the missing coordinates. The missing residues on the protein surface, His0-Met1-Ser2, were ignored. The detergent molecules Dsu896 and Cl903 were removed, as they are irrelevant for the catalytic reaction. To generate the channel for the whole substrate L-Thr with a length of about 17 \u00c5, we rotated the side chain of Phe196 around the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 bond with an angle of 120\u00b0, as suggested by Borowski et al.33 and previous experimental work.20 Sub-sequently, the substrate was docked into the channel above the active site by using the AutoDock 4.2 program.49We assigned the protonation states of acidic and basic residues, using the pKa values given by the empirical PROPKA50 procedure, and we verified the results through visual inspection. The detailed protonation scheme is included in the Supporting Information. The missing hydrogen atoms were added by the HBUILD module51 embedded in CHARMM.52 The positions of the hydrogen atoms were optimized with 100 steps of adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) minimization. A water layer of 16 \u00c5 thickness was constructed around the enzyme using the VMD software package.53 The inner 8 \u00c5 of the solvent was minimized by 2000 steps of ABNR followed by 500 steps of steepest decent (SD) and then equilibrated by MD for 50 ps at 300 K while the remainder of the system was kept fixed. For MD runs, to investigate the effect of surrounding residue fluctuations on the halogenation/hydroxylation selectiv-ity,19,30,32,36,38 the entire system was also rebuilt as the ferric hydroxyl radical intermediate. The atomic electrostatic potential (ESP) charges were taken from the QM/MM calculations, while all other features were kept the same as for the oxoferryl species. Both the oxoferryl and ferric hydroxyl radical species contain 26971 atoms, including 22104 atoms of solvent for the wild-type SyrB2 (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). After the full solvation procedure, a productive MD simulation of 20 ns was run for both the oxoferryl species and the ferric hydroxyl radical intermediate using the CHARMM22 force fields implemented in the CHARMM program. The coordinates of the entire Cl-FeIV\ue0c8O or Cl-FeIII-OH unit and the metal-ligating residues as well as the outer 8 \u00c5 of the solvent layer were kept fixed during all MD simulations. Two representative snapshots from the MD trajectory of the oxoferryl species were selected for studying the H-abstraction reaction (snapshots at 2 and 10 ns), while four representative snapshots at 1, 1.5, 2, and 5 ns from the MD trajectory of the ferric hydroxyl radical intermediates were selected to investigate the competition of the halogenation and hydroxylation reactions. To understand the root cause of the loss of reactivity in the Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutants, we performed 20 ns MD simulations on the ferric hydroxyl radical intermediate of Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu variants using the same setup as for the wild-type SyrB2 enzyme except for the specific mutated residues. 2.2. QM/MM Methodology. The QM region in our QM/ MMcalculations contained 70 atoms for the oxoferryl species (or ferric hydroxyl/carbon-radical intermediate), including FeIV\ue0c8O (or FeIII-OH), the chloro ligand, succinate, two 4-methyl-imidazole groups, and the substrate, as shown in Figure 2.31-34 All calculations were carried out within ChemShell,54 combining Turbomole55 as the QM code and DL_POLY56 as the MM code. The electronic embedding scheme57 was applied to include the polarizing effect of the enzyme environment on the QM region. The QM/MM boundary was treated by hydrogen link atoms58 with the charge shift model.59 For the QM region, the unrestricted B3LYP (UB3LYP)60-62 functional was employed with two basis sets. The choice of UB3LYP relied Scheme 2. Truncation of the Substrate Component Involving on past findings of a good match between UB3LYP and CCSD(T)63 and between UB3LYP/MM and CASSCF/MM64 for high-valent FeIV-oxo oxidants. A recent careful benchmark study by Thiel and Neese showed that B3LYP is the most suitable functional for FeIV-oxo systems.65 A split valence polarized basis set (B1), LACVP for iron66 and 6-31G** for other atoms, was used for the geometry optimization and zero point energy (ZPE) calculations, while an extended all-electron basis set (B2), def2-TZVP67 for all atoms, was used to correct the relative energies of the species. The Grimme DFT-D2 correction68 was added to the relative energies of the species obtained from UB3LYP for the QM atoms. The MM region was described by the CHARMM22 force field. The HDLC optimizer69 was employed in the geometry optimization, and the core regions of optimization were within 8 \u00c5 of the QM regions (see section 1 in the Supporting Information). All transition states (TSs) were located by relaxed potential energy surface (PES) scans followed by full TS optimizations using the P-RFO optimizer implemented in the HDLC code, and all TSs and minima were confirmed by frequency calculations to have only 1 and 0 imaginary vibrations, respectively. Figure 3. (a) QM/MM (UB3LYP/B2) relative energies (in kcal/mol) for the isomerizations of three FeIV\ue0c8O isomers, 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. H-Abstraction. QM-only calculations31-34 have pre-viously showed that only the quintet state is relevant to the reactivity of the FeIV\ue0c8O species in nonheme enzymes. To test this conclusion withQM/MM, we investigated theH-abstraction processes for the triplet, quintet, and septet states and reaffirmed (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) the quintet state as the lowest in energy among the three spin states for all species. Therefore, all the following results and discussion are based on the calculations done for the quintet state. The computed electronic energy barrier and free energy barrier are generally close for H-abstraction in P450 enzymes, as Thiel and Senn discovered by sampling over the protein\u2019s Figure 5. Statistical analyses for the H-bond between Arg254 and the OH group of the active site iron in fluctuations.70,71 Sampling procedures (e.g., using umbrella sampling or free energy perturbation theory) are highly computationally demanding with ab initio or DFT QM components, and this is why calculations of QM/MM free energy for iron-containing enzymes are still rare. Herein we utilized thermal and entropic corrections just for the QM system to produce a similar result. H-abstraction by 5RC1 has a barrier of 18.4 kcal/mol with ZPE and the dispersion correction incorporated. The QM entropic correction (-T\u0394S) increases the barrier by 1.5 kcal/mol, and the QM thermal contributions to the internal energy (\u0394Uth) decreases the barrier by 1.1 kcal/mol. The net effect is a close match between the computed barrier of 18.4 kcal/mol (with ZPE and dispersion correction) and the computed free energy barrier of 18.8 kcal/mol. However, this practice neglects protein fluctuations; therefore, the computed barriers may not be accurate.70,71 Thus, given the prohibitively high computational cost of QM/MM MD-based free energy calculations, we treated the barriers with ZPE and dispersion corrections as estimates of the free energy barriers in the enzyme. Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopic experiments demonstrated that there are two rapidly interconverting isomers of the FeIV-oxo species, and at least one of these Cl-FeIV-oxo species abstracts hydrogen from the substrate.11,25 In this study, we successfully located three isomers of the FeIV-oxo species, labeled as 5RC1, 5RC2, and 5RC3, which were previously reported by QM studies.33,34 As such, we first investigated the isomerization of the three Cl-FeIV-oxo species, and the results are summarized in Figure 3. The calculated FeIV\ue0c8O displacement relative to 5RC3, which may cause the much higher energy barrier in the QM/MM-calculated H-abstraction by 5RC3 via 5TS3. The conformational dynamics of 5RC3 leads to a 4.2 kcal/mol difference in the H-abstraction barriers. However, the barrier for H-abstraction by 5RC3 is still much larger (more than 20 kcal/mol) than that for H-abstraction by 5RC1 (see Table S2). The QM model study may yield a biased conformation of the substrate and the protein environment in the gas-phase study and thus make 5RC3 appear to be an efficient H-abstractor, in contrast to the QM/MM findings herein. Wong et al. proposed that 5RC2, with its FeIV-oxo vector perpendicular to the substrate C-H bond, corresponds to the conformation in which C-H activation occurs, as the position of the substrate radical is favorable for the subsequent Cl rebound.34 However, our QM/MM calculations do not support this proposal, as 5RC2 is not stable, and it converts back to 5RC1 during the H-abstraction. The QM model study by Wong et al.34 predicted a very short oxo-Hdistance of 2.75 \u00c5 in 5RC2 (note this study did not consider the protein environment), while the present QM/ MM calculations show that in 5RC2 there is a long distance of 5.46 \u00c5 due to the constraints of the protein environment. 3.2. Rebound Reaction. In the last section, we demon-strated that the H-abstraction reaction will be predominantly carried out by the Cl-FeIV\ue0c8O species 5RC1, leading to the Cl-FeIII-OH radical intermediate 5Int1. In this section, we proceed to discuss the transformations of 5Int1. In order to investigate the effect of surrounding residues on the halogenation/hydroxyla-tion selectivity in 5Int1, we performed 20 ns MD simulations on 5Int1. Figure 5a shows the probability distribution for the ends up favoring isomerization and then Cl rebound, with an overall barrier of 6.4 kcal/mol, hence resulting in exclusive Cl rebound. To probe the H-bonding effect further, we also considered a snapshot wherein the H-bond between Arg254 and FeIII-OH is practically absent. Figure 8 summarizes and compares the reactivity network of both snapshots with or without H-bonding interactions between Arg254 and FeIII-OH. If this H-bond is maintained, the OH rebound will experience a higher barrier (10.4 kcal/mol in Figure 8a) relative to the isomerization of 5Int1 to 5Int3 (6.4 kcal/mol in Figure 8a), as the H-bond will hinder the rebound of the OH ligand to the carbon radical center and facilitate the isomerization. In 5Int1 (Figure 6b), the guanidinium group of the Arg254 residue maintains a hydro-gen-bonding interaction with the OH group of Cl-FeIII-OH (the O-H3 distance is 1.79 \u00c5), while the O---H4 distance is 2.78 \u00c5. During the isomerization of Cl-FeIII-OH, the O---H4 distance decreases to 1.83 \u00c5 (see 5TSRI(1,2) in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Clearly, the Arg254 residue facilitates the isomerization by stabilizing the transition state through additional H-bonding interactions. As such, the isomerization from 5Int1 to 5Int3 is favored in comparison with the Cl/OH rebound reactions via 5Int1. Once 5Int3 is formed, the Cl-rebound reaction will occur readily to yield the chlorinated product (as the green pathway in Figure 8a shows). In contrast, if Arg254 is not H-bonded or weakly H-bonded to the OH group (see the QM/MM optimized H-bond length of 2.67 \u00c5 in Figure 8b), the OH group will easily rebound to the carbon radical, as the OH is adjacent to it (see the barrier of 3.4 kcal/mol in Figure 8b). Inspection of the results in Figure 8 reveals the dual roles of H-bonding interactions between the Arg254 residue and the OH ligand of the Cl-FeIII-OH in controlling the reactivity and selectivity of the Cl-FeIII-OH species. This H-bond not only prevents the rebound of OH to form a hydroxylation product but also facilitates the isomerization of the Cl-FeIII-OH inter-mediate. 3.3. Articulating the New Mechanism of Selective Halogenation by SyrB2. The above QM/MM calculations in Figure 8 suggest a new mechanism of selective halogenation by SyrB2, which is illustrated in Figure 9, where the green arrows depict the most energetically favorable path. Thus, the reaction starts from the active Cl-FeIV-oxo species 5RC1, in which the oxo group is pointing toward the target C-H bond. H-abstraction by this Cl-FeIV-oxo complex leads to the FeIII-OH/carbon-radical intermediate 5Int1, in which the OH ligand is pointing toward the carbon radical of the substrate. Protein fluctuations around the formed 5Int1 establish an H-bond between Arg254 and Cl-FeIII-OH. This H-bond increases the hydroxylation barrier for 5Int1 and decreases the isomerization barrier of 5Int1 to 5Int3 via exchange of the positions of the Cl and OH ligands. As such, in 5Int3 the Cl ligand points toward the carbon radical of the substrate and halogenation takes place favorably over hydroxylation. Our QM/MM-derived mechanism shows therefore that selective halogenation is achieved via the isomerization of the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate, rather than by the isomerization of the Cl-FeIV\ue0c8O active species as previously proposed.33 3.4. Halogenation vs Hydroxylation: Comparison with Experiment. Mass spectrometric (MS) studies identified a partitioning of 87% halogenation versus 13% hydroxylation for the native L-Thr substrate,36 indicating the minor OH-rebound reaction still transpires. In the subsequent section, we show that Figure 9.Reaction network of the selective halogenation by SyrB2 starting from the FeIV\ue0c8O species of 5RC1. The green pathway is the sole pathway for halogenation of the L-Thr substrate, while the red paths are not taken. The H-bonding interaction between the Arg254 residue and the OH ligand of FeIII-OH is highlighted in 5Int1. ACS Catalysis Research Article DOI: 10.1021/acscatal.5b02825 ACS Catal. 2016, 6, 2694-2704 2701 Arg254 plays key roles in determining halogenation/hydrox-ylation selectivities. As discussed above, the H-bond interaction of Arg254 plays dual roles in the selective halogenation by SyrB2 and thus not only prevents the OH-rebound reaction but also facilitates the isomerization of 5Int1 to 5Int3 leading to chlorination. The MD simulation in Figure 5 shows that this H-bond is well preserved in the majority of frames along the trajectory (71% and 88% conformers have H3-O distances of less than 1.9 and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively), so that the majority of reactions will lead to the chlorination reactions. In the minority of frames of the trajectory, where the OH is released from the H-bond\u2019s grip, hydroxylation will occur (Figure 8b). The present findings are in good accord with experiment.36 More evidence was found in another \u03b1KG-dependent CurA halogenase, whose Arg247 occupies the same site as Arg254 in SyrB2, as its halogenation reactivity was completely suppressed in the Arg247Glu and Arg247Ala mutants.12 To further support our conclusions, we performed 20 ns MD simulations on the Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutants of the SyrB2 enzyme. It was observed that chlorination does not transpire in either mutant20 and the hydroxylation is enhanced in the Ala118Glu mutant.36 As can be seen from the statistical analyses in Figure 10, unlike the wild-type enzyme, the Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutants show no H-bonding interaction between Arg254 and FeIII-OH during the simulations. The average H3-O distance is 3.10 (2.89) \u00c5 with a mean square deviation of 0.22 (0.28) \u00c5 in the Ala118Asp (Ala118Glu) mutant, respectively. Ala118 is a second-shell residue located near the His116 residue and the chlorine atom. As such, the Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutations lead to the rearrangement of second-shell residues, and the side chain of Phe121 moves to the position between Arg254 and FeIII-OH. In this manner, the steric effect and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain Phe121 causes the breakage of the H-bonding interaction between Arg254 and FeIII-OH. According to the mechanism proposed above, these two mutants should not lead to any chlorination products, which is in full accord with experimental findings.20 Figure 10.

CONCLUSION Combined QM/MM and MD calculations were used for exploring the mechanism of selective halogenation by SyrB2. A MD simulation of 20 ns was performed for the oxoferryl species to model the H-abstraction reaction. In this process, we located three isomers of the Cl-FeIV-oxo species, and QM/MM calculations singled out the Cl-FeIV-oxo species, 5RC1, in which the oxo points toward the target C-H bond, as the sole active species in the C-H activation. The other isomers were found to be sluggish C-H activators. The Cl-FeIII-OH/R\u2022 intermediate after H-abstraction also exhibited three intercon-verting isomers, 5Int1, 5Int2, and 5Int3. The route to selective chlorination was found to be the isomerization of 5Int1 to 5Int3, followed by a very facile halogenation. The key to the halogenation/hydroxylation selectivities of SyrB2 was found to be the H-bond between Arg254 and the OH group of Cl-FeIII-OH. This H-bond not only prevents the OH-rebound reaction but also facilitates the isomerization of 5Int1 to 5Int3, so that the Cl ligand approaches the carbon radical and leads to chlorination. Whenever Arg254 is not H-bonded or weakly H-bonded to the OH group, the OH group in 5Int1 will easily rebound onto the carbon radical and lead to hydroxylation, thus bypassing 5Int3 which is capable of chlorination activity. A MD simulation of 20 ns for the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate reproduces the halogen-ation/hydroxylation selectivities in line with experiment. This is a novel mechanism that highlights the role of an H-bonding interaction between the protein and a reaction intermediate.

        "ABSTRACT: The enzyme SyrB2 employs an FeIV-oxo species to achieve selective C-H halogenation of L-threonine. Herein, we use combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to decipher the mechanism of selective halogenation by SyrB2. Our QM/MM calculations show the presence of three Cl-FeIV-oxo isomers which interconvert, and only the one having its oxo ligand pointing toward the target C-H bond is active during the hydrogen atom abstraction (H-abstraction) process. The fate of the formed Cl-FeIII-OH/R\u2022 intermediate is determined by a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the Arg254 residue and the OH ligand of Cl-FeIII-OH. The hydrogen bond not only prevents the OH group from participating in the followup rebound step to form a hydroxylated product but also facilitates the isomerization of the Cl-FeIII-OH/R\u2022 intermediate so that the Cl is directed toward the alkyl radical. The role of Arg254 in regulating the selectivity of chlorination is further discussed and connected to the experimentally observed effect of mutations of Arg247 (Arg247Glu and Arg247Ala) in the related CurA halogenase. The Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutants of SyrB2 were investigated by MD simulations, and they were found to suppress the H-bonding interaction of Arg254 with Cl-FeIII-OH: this result is in accord with their experimentally observed suppressed chlorination activity. This novel mechanism highlights the role of the H-bonding interaction between the protein and a reaction intermediate.

        "1. INTRODUCTION Mononuclear nonheme iron enzymes catalyze a myriad of chemically challenging transformations, including C-H bond hydroxylation, heteroatom oxidation, desaturation, epoxidation, and halogenation, which are important for the biosynthesis and degradation of compounds in metabolic processes.1-7 Among these versatile enzymes, the specific family that requires FeII as a cofactor and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) as a cosubstrate to activate aliphatic compounds to their halogenated products is called \u03b1KG-dependent halogenases.8-13 As halogenated compounds are the precursors of many organometallic species in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds,14-16 unraveling the mechanisms of carbon-halogen bond formation is extremely important.",
        "Syringomycin biosynthesis enzyme 2 (SyrB2), found in the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae B301D,17 chlori-nates the \u03b3-carbon of L-threonine in the biosynthesis of a phytotoxin called syringomycin E.9 SyrB2 is a member of the \u03b1KG-dependent halogenase family. Recently, wild-type SyrB2 and the Ala118Gly mutant were also found to be able to perform C-N bond formation reactions by substituting the native halide ion with the nitrogenous anions N3 -and NO2 -.18,19 These results hint that the Cl is not by itself the cause of the selectivity of halogenation over hydroxylation, and they thereby underscore the need to understand why, unlike other similar enzymes, C-H activation does not end with hydroxylation.",

The native substrate L-Thr-S-SyrB1 is shown in Figure 1b, and the \u03b3-methyl group of the L-Thr moiety that is chlorinated in the catalytic cycle is highlighted in red.",
        "Scheme 1 displays the catalytic cycle of the SyrB2 halogenase which was proposed in previous experimental studies.9,19-29 The catalytic cycle is initiated by the binding of theO2molecule to the FeII center to form a ferric-superoxo species. Subsequently, the distal oxygen atom nucleophilically attacks the \u03b1KG ligand to form a peroxo-bridged FeIV species. The subsequent cleavage of the bridged O-O bond and the decarboxylation of \u03b1KG lead to the formation of a Cl-FeIV-oxo complex. Thereafter, a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the substrate L-Thr by the Cl-FeIV-oxo species to form an alkyl radical and an FeIII-OH complex. This is followed by a rebound reaction of the radical with the chlorine atom to generate the chlorinated product. A competitive hydroxylation reaction may occur via the rebound of the alkyl radical to the FeIII-OH group. The catalytic cycle finishes with the binding of another molecule of \u03b1KG and another molecule of the substrate to reproduce the resting ferrous reactant complex.",
        "Experimental and quantum mechanical (QM) investigations have been performed to gain insight into the selective halogenation by SyrB2, and various mechanistic explanations have been proposed on the basis of such studies.29-34 De Visser and Latifi have shown that the byproduct of CO2 from O2 activation shuttles the hydroxyl group of the FeIIIOH moiety away to prevent the occurrence of hydroxylation by forming bicarbonate.30 Kulik et al. proposed that chlorination following hydrogen atom abstraction (H-abstraction) is barrierless; therefore, the halogenases do not hydroxylate their substrates.31 Hillier et al. suggested that the predominant chlorination should be caused by the protonation of the hydroxo intermediate, which inhibits the hydroxylation reaction.32 Noack and Siegbahn proposed that the barriers for hydroxylation and halogenation by the biomimetic equivalent of SyrB2 are comparable.35 On the basis of a model study considering first-shell and some of the second-shell residues of the iron center of SyrB2, Borowski et al. found a carbon-radical intermediate that favors chlorination is generated by H-abstraction via a second oxoferryl species isomer, which has a lower barrier in H-abstraction than the original oxoferryl species. Furthermore, they proposed that the interchange of oxo and chloride ligands relative to their positions in the crystal structure could control the selectivity.33 Using nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) experi-ments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Wong et al. found that the oxoferryl species which has its FeIV-oxo bond perpendicular to the C-H bond of the native substrate L-Thr favors chlorination.34Moreover, experimental findings led to the proposal that the different positions of the methylene radical vis-a-\u0300vis the chlorine and hydroxyl ligands can lead to the different halogenation and hydroxylation reactivities not only for the native substrate but also for non-native substrates.19,25,36,37 Using DFT methods augmented with a Hubbard U correction, Kulik and Drennan found that the propensity of the native substrate toward halogenation is strongly dependent on deeper substrate delivery into the active site following H-abstraction.38",
        "The above mechanistic proposals seem to be quite diverse. Furthermore, it was found that the halogenation/hydroxylation selectivity strongly depends on the protein environment. For",

        "example, as found by Blasiak et al.,20 Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutations completely suppress chlorination activity of the enzyme. As previous QM studies did not consider the complete protein environment of this enzymatic reaction, we deemed it necessary to carry out combined quantummechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)39-43 calculations and molecular dynam-ics (MD) studies to thoroughly decipher the mechanism of halogenation/hydroxylation selectivity by SyrB2. Indeed, QM/ MM studies of other nonheme enzymes, such as TauD,44 AlkB,45,46 and HEPD,47 have clearly and effectively elucidated the crucial influence of protein environments on complex enzymatic reactions. Herein, we started from the active species of FeIV-oxo, which has been experimentally characterized in many halogenases,11,25,34,36,48 to explore the selective mechanism of halogenation vs hydroxylation in SyrB2. As the crystal structure for the substrate\u2019s carrier protein SyrB1 is absent,20 we truncated the L-Thr substrate according to the strategy used in a previous study,33 as specified in Scheme 2. As will be demonstrated below,",
        "selectivity arises from the H-bonding interaction between the Arg254 residue and the OH ligand of the Cl-FeIII-OH species after H-abstraction. This H-bonding interaction prevents theOH group from participating in the followup rebound step and in a nutshell steers the reaction\u2019s outcome toward selective chlorination.",
        "2. METHODS",
        "2.1. Setup of the System. The system was first constructed using the oxoferryl species to model the H-abstraction process. The initial coordinates were taken from the X-ray crystal structure (PDB code 2FCT). Only chain A was kept in our study.20 The missing residues, Ile57-Ser58-Gly59-Gly60, in the inner protein were added by superimposing 2FCT on another crystal structure20 (PDB code 2FCU, chain A) to determine the missing coordinates. The missing residues on the protein surface, His0-Met1-Ser2, were ignored. The detergent molecules Dsu896 and Cl903 were removed, as they are irrelevant for the catalytic reaction. To generate the channel for the whole substrate L-Thr with a length of about 17 \u00c5, we rotated the side chain of Phe196 around the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 bond with an angle of 120\u00b0, as suggested by Borowski et al.33 and previous experimental work.20 Sub-sequently, the substrate was docked into the channel above the active site by using the AutoDock 4.2 program.49We assigned the protonation states of acidic and basic residues, using the pKa values given by the empirical PROPKA50 procedure, and we verified the results through visual inspection. The detailed protonation scheme is included in the Supporting Information. The missing hydrogen atoms were added by the HBUILD module51 embedded in CHARMM.52 The positions of the hydrogen atoms were optimized with 100 steps of adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) minimization. A water layer of 16 \u00c5 thickness was constructed around the enzyme using the VMD software package.53 The inner 8 \u00c5 of the solvent was minimized by 2000 steps of ABNR followed by 500 steps of steepest decent (SD) and then equilibrated by MD for 50 ps at 300 K while the remainder of the system was kept fixed.",
        "For MD runs, to investigate the effect of surrounding residue fluctuations on the halogenation/hydroxylation selectiv-ity,19,30,32,36,38 the entire system was also rebuilt as the ferric hydroxyl radical intermediate. The atomic electrostatic potential (ESP) charges were taken from the QM/MM calculations, while all other features were kept the same as for the oxoferryl species. Both the oxoferryl and ferric hydroxyl radical species contain 26971 atoms, including 22104 atoms of solvent for the wild-type SyrB2 (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). After the full solvation procedure, a productive MD simulation of 20 ns was run for both the oxoferryl species and the ferric hydroxyl radical intermediate using the CHARMM22 force fields implemented in the CHARMM program. The coordinates of the entire Cl-FeIV\ue0c8O or Cl-FeIII-OH unit and the metal-ligating residues as well as the outer 8 \u00c5 of the solvent layer were kept fixed during all MD simulations. Two representative snapshots from the MD trajectory of the oxoferryl species were selected for studying the H-abstraction reaction (snapshots at 2 and 10 ns), while four representative snapshots at 1, 1.5, 2, and 5 ns from the MD trajectory of the ferric hydroxyl radical intermediates were selected to investigate the competition of the halogenation and hydroxylation reactions. To understand the root cause of the loss of reactivity in the Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutants, we performed 20 ns MD simulations on the ferric hydroxyl radical intermediate of Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu variants using the same setup as for the wild-type SyrB2 enzyme except for the specific mutated residues.",
        "2.2. QM/MM Methodology. The QM region in our QM/ MMcalculations contained 70 atoms for the oxoferryl species (or ferric hydroxyl/carbon-radical intermediate), including FeIV\ue0c8O (or FeIII-OH), the chloro ligand, succinate, two 4-methyl-imidazole groups, and the substrate, as shown in Figure 2.31-34",
        "All calculations were carried out within ChemShell,54 combining Turbomole55 as the QM code and DL_POLY56 as the MM code. The electronic embedding scheme57 was applied to include the polarizing effect of the enzyme environment on the QM region.

To test this conclusion withQM/MM, we investigated theH-abstraction processes for the triplet, quintet, and septet states and reaffirmed (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) the quintet state as the lowest in energy among the three spin states for all species. Therefore, all the following results and discussion are based on the calculations done for the quintet state.",

        "fluctuations.70,71 Sampling procedures (e.g., using umbrella sampling or free energy perturbation theory) are highly computationally demanding with ab initio or DFT QM components, and this is why calculations of QM/MM free energy for iron-containing enzymes are still rare. Herein we utilized thermal and entropic corrections just for the QM system to produce a similar result. H-abstraction by 5RC1 has a barrier of 18.4 kcal/mol with ZPE and the dispersion correction incorporated. The QM entropic correction (-T\u0394S) increases the barrier by 1.5 kcal/mol, and the QM thermal contributions to the internal energy (\u0394Uth) decreases the barrier by 1.1 kcal/mol. The net effect is a close match between the computed barrier of 18.4 kcal/mol (with ZPE and dispersion correction) and the computed free energy barrier of 18.8 kcal/mol. However, this practice neglects protein fluctuations; therefore, the computed barriers may not be accurate.70,71 Thus, given the prohibitively high computational cost of QM/MM MD-based free energy calculations, we treated the barriers with ZPE and dispersion corrections as estimates of the free energy barriers in the enzyme.",
        "Mo\u0308ssbauer spectroscopic experiments demonstrated that there are two rapidly interconverting isomers of the FeIV-oxo species, and at least one of these Cl-FeIV-oxo species abstracts hydrogen from the substrate.11,25 In this study, we successfully located three isomers of the FeIV-oxo species, labeled as 5RC1, 5RC2, and 5RC3, which were previously reported by QM studies.33,34 As such, we first investigated the isomerization of the three Cl-FeIV-oxo species, and the results are summarized in Figure 3. The calculated FeIV\ue0c8O",
        "displacement relative to 5RC3, which may cause the much higher energy barrier in the QM/MM-calculated H-abstraction by 5RC3 via 5TS3. The conformational dynamics of 5RC3 leads to a 4.2 kcal/mol difference in the H-abstraction barriers. However, the barrier for H-abstraction by 5RC3 is still much larger (more than 20 kcal/mol) than that for H-abstraction by 5RC1 (see Table S2). The QM model study may yield a biased conformation of the substrate and the protein environment in the gas-phase study and thus make 5RC3 appear to be an efficient H-abstractor, in contrast to the QM/MM findings herein. Wong et al. proposed that 5RC2, with its FeIV-oxo vector perpendicular to the substrate C-H bond, corresponds to the conformation in which C-H activation occurs, as the position of the substrate radical is favorable for the subsequent Cl rebound.34 However, our QM/MM calculations do not support this proposal, as 5RC2 is not stable, and it converts back to 5RC1 during the H-abstraction. The QM model study by Wong et al.34 predicted a very short oxo-Hdistance of 2.75 \u00c5 in 5RC2 (note this study did not consider the protein environment), while the present QM/ MM calculations show that in 5RC2 there is a long distance of 5.46 \u00c5 due to the constraints of the protein environment.",
        "3.2. Rebound Reaction. In the last section, we demon-strated that the H-abstraction reaction will be predominantly carried out by the Cl-FeIV\ue0c8O species 5RC1, leading to the Cl-FeIII-OH radical intermediate 5Int1. In this section, we proceed to discuss the transformations of 5Int1. In order to investigate the effect of surrounding residues on the halogenation/hydroxyla-tion selectivity in 5Int1, we performed 20 ns MD simulations on 5Int1. Figure 5a shows the probability distribution for the",
        "ends up favoring isomerization and then Cl rebound, with an overall barrier of 6.4 kcal/mol, hence resulting in exclusive Cl rebound.",
        "To probe the H-bonding effect further, we also considered a snapshot wherein the H-bond between Arg254 and FeIII-OH is practically absent. Figure 8 summarizes and compares the reactivity network of both snapshots with or without H-bonding interactions between Arg254 and FeIII-OH. If this H-bond is maintained, the OH rebound will experience a higher barrier (10.4 kcal/mol in Figure 8a) relative to the isomerization of 5Int1 to 5Int3 (6.4 kcal/mol in Figure 8a), as the H-bond will hinder the rebound of the OH ligand to the carbon radical center and facilitate the isomerization. In 5Int1 (Figure 6b), the guanidinium group of the Arg254 residue maintains a hydro-gen-bonding interaction with the OH group of Cl-FeIII-OH (the O-H3 distance is 1.79 \u00c5), while the O---H4 distance is 2.78 \u00c5. During the isomerization of Cl-FeIII-OH, the O---H4 distance decreases to 1.83 \u00c5 (see 5TSRI(1,2) in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Clearly, the Arg254 residue facilitates the isomerization by stabilizing the transition state through additional H-bonding interactions. As such, the isomerization from 5Int1 to 5Int3 is favored in comparison with the Cl/OH rebound reactions via 5Int1. Once 5Int3 is formed, the Cl-rebound reaction will occur readily to yield the chlorinated product (as the green pathway in Figure 8a shows). In contrast, if Arg254 is not H-bonded or weakly H-bonded to the OH group (see the QM/MM optimized H-bond length of 2.67 \u00c5 in Figure 8b), the OH group will easily rebound to the carbon radical, as the OH is adjacent to it (see the barrier of 3.4 kcal/mol in Figure 8b). Inspection of the results in Figure 8 reveals the dual roles of H-bonding interactions between the Arg254 residue and the OH ligand of the Cl-FeIII-OH in controlling the reactivity and selectivity of the Cl-FeIII-OH species. This H-bond not only prevents the rebound of OH to form a hydroxylation product but also facilitates the isomerization of the Cl-FeIII-OH inter-mediate.",
        "3.3. Articulating the New Mechanism of Selective Halogenation by SyrB2. The above QM/MM calculations in Figure 8 suggest a new mechanism of selective halogenation by SyrB2, which is illustrated in Figure 9, where the green arrows depict the most energetically favorable path. Thus, the reaction starts from the active Cl-FeIV-oxo species 5RC1, in which the oxo group is pointing toward the target C-H bond. H-abstraction by this Cl-FeIV-oxo complex leads to the FeIII-OH/carbon-radical intermediate 5Int1, in which the OH ligand is pointing toward the carbon radical of the substrate. Protein fluctuations around the formed 5Int1 establish an H-bond between Arg254 and Cl-FeIII-OH. This H-bond increases the hydroxylation barrier for 5Int1 and decreases the isomerization barrier of 5Int1 to 5Int3 via exchange of the positions of the Cl and OH ligands. As such, in 5Int3 the Cl ligand points toward the carbon radical of the substrate and halogenation takes place favorably over hydroxylation. Our QM/MM-derived mechanism shows therefore that selective halogenation is achieved via the isomerization of the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate, rather than by the isomerization of the Cl-FeIV\ue0c8O active species as previously proposed.33",
        "3.4. Halogenation vs Hydroxylation: Comparison with Experiment. Mass spectrometric (MS) studies identified a partitioning of 87% halogenation versus 13% hydroxylation for the native L-Thr substrate,36 indicating the minor OH-rebound reaction still transpires. In the subsequent section, we show that",

        "Arg254 plays key roles in determining halogenation/hydrox-ylation selectivities. As discussed above, the H-bond interaction of Arg254 plays dual roles in the selective halogenation by SyrB2 and thus not only prevents the OH-rebound reaction but also facilitates the isomerization of 5Int1 to 5Int3 leading to chlorination. The MD simulation in Figure 5 shows that this H-bond is well preserved in the majority of frames along the trajectory (71% and 88% conformers have H3-O distances of less than 1.9 and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively), so that the majority of reactions will lead to the chlorination reactions. In the minority of frames of the trajectory, where the OH is released from the H-bond\u2019s grip, hydroxylation will occur (Figure 8b). The present findings are in good accord with experiment.36 More evidence was found in another \u03b1KG-dependent CurA halogenase, whose Arg247 occupies the same site as Arg254 in SyrB2, as its halogenation reactivity was completely suppressed in the Arg247Glu and Arg247Ala mutants.12",
        "To further support our conclusions, we performed 20 ns MD simulations on the Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutants of the SyrB2 enzyme. It was observed that chlorination does not transpire in either mutant20 and the hydroxylation is enhanced in the Ala118Glu mutant.36 As can be seen from the statistical analyses in Figure 10, unlike the wild-type enzyme, the Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutants show no H-bonding interaction between Arg254 and FeIII-OH during the simulations. The average H3-O distance is 3.10 (2.89) \u00c5 with a mean square deviation of 0.22 (0.28) \u00c5 in the Ala118Asp (Ala118Glu) mutant, respectively. Ala118 is a second-shell residue located near the His116 residue and the chlorine atom. As such, the Ala118Asp and Ala118Glu mutations lead to the rearrangement of second-shell residues, and the side chain of Phe121 moves to the position between Arg254 and FeIII-OH. In this manner, the steric effect and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain Phe121 causes the breakage of the H-bonding interaction between Arg254 and FeIII-OH. According to the mechanism proposed above, these two mutants should not lead to any chlorination products, which is in full accord with experimental findings.20",

        "4. CONCLUSION Combined QM/MM and MD calculations were used for exploring the mechanism of selective halogenation by SyrB2. A MD simulation of 20 ns was performed for the oxoferryl species to model the H-abstraction reaction. In this process, we located three isomers of the Cl-FeIV-oxo species, and QM/MM calculations singled out the Cl-FeIV-oxo species, 5RC1, in which the oxo points toward the target C-H bond, as the sole active species in the C-H activation. The other isomers were found to be sluggish C-H activators. The Cl-FeIII-OH/R\u2022 intermediate after H-abstraction also exhibited three intercon-verting isomers, 5Int1, 5Int2, and 5Int3. The route to selective chlorination was found to be the isomerization of 5Int1 to 5Int3, followed by a very facile halogenation. The key to the halogenation/hydroxylation selectivities of SyrB2 was found to be the H-bond between Arg254 and the OH group of Cl-FeIII-OH. This H-bond not only prevents the OH-rebound reaction but also facilitates the isomerization of 5Int1 to 5Int3, so that the Cl ligand approaches the carbon radical and leads to chlorination. Whenever Arg254 is not H-bonded or weakly H-bonded to the OH group, the OH group in 5Int1 will easily rebound onto the carbon radical and lead to hydroxylation, thus bypassing 5Int3 which is capable of chlorination activity. A MD simulation of 20 ns for the Cl-FeIII-OH intermediate reproduces the halogen-ation/hydroxylation selectivities in line with experiment. This is a novel mechanism that highlights the role of an H-bonding interaction between the protein and a reaction intermediate.",
