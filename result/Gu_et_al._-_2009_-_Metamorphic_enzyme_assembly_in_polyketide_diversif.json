Grindberg7, Lena Gerwick7, Kristina Ha\u030akansson3, Peter Wipf6, Janet L. Smith1,4, William H. Gerwick7 & David H. Sherman1,2,3,5 Natural product chemical diversity is fuelled by the emergence and ongoing evolution of biosynthetic pathways in secondary meta-bolism1. However, co-evolution of enzymes for metabolic diver-sification is not well understood, especially at the biochemical level. Here, two parallel assemblies with an extraordinarily high sequence identity fromLyngbyamajuscula formab-branched cyclo-propane in the curacin A pathway (Cur), and a vinyl chloride group in the jamaicamide pathway (Jam). The components include a halo-genase, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl enzyme cassette for poly-ketide b-branching, and an enoyl reductase domain. The halogenase from CurA, and the dehydratases (ECH1s), decarboxylases (ECH2s) and enoyl reductase domains frombothCur and Jam,were assessed biochemically to determine the mechanisms of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride formation.Unexpectedly, the polyketide b-branching pathway was modified by introduction of a c-chlorination step on (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl mediated by Cur halogenase, a non-haem Fe(II), a-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme2. In a diver-gent scheme, Cur ECH2 was found to catalyse formation of the a,b enoyl thioester, whereas Jam ECH2 formed a vinyl chloride moiety by selectively generating the corresponding b,c enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chloroglutaconyl decarboxylation product. Finally, the enoyl reductase domain of CurF specifically catalysed an unprecedented cyclopropanation on the chlorinated product of Cur ECH2 instead of the canonical a,b C5C saturation reaction. Thus, the combination of chlorination and polyketide b-branching, coupled with mechanistic diversification of ECH2 and enoyl reduc-tase, leads to the formation of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride moieties. These results reveal a parallel interplay of evolutionary events inmultienzyme systems leading to functional groupdiversity in secondary metabolites. The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is \u2018diversity oriented\u20193,4, targeting the variable environment by producing a vast array of com-plex chemical structures. This productivity is largely fuelled by the rapid evolution of biosynthetic genes and functional alteration of the corresponding enzymes1,4. However, our current understanding of pathway diversification is largely based on genetic and bioinformatics approaches. The curacin and jamaicamide metabolites from Lyngbya majuscula are mixed-polyketide nonribosomal-peptide natural products with potent anticancer and sodiumchannel blocking activities, respectively5,6. The corresponding biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1a) provide an unusual opportunity to investigate the biosynthetic origin of chemical diversity. Within these dissimilar pathways, the parallel, highly conserved compo-nents catalyse formation of a cyclopropane ring for curacin and a vinyl chloride for jamaicamide5,7. Comparative biochemical studies on the variant functions and selectivities of these highly parallel biosynthetic components form the subject of this report. Two parallel Cur and Jam enzyme assemblies are incorporated into the early polyketide synthase modules, and are predicted to catalyse polyketide b-branching reactions in the growing chain elongation intermediates5,7. These catalytic domains and discrete enzymes span fromCurA toCurF and from JamE to JamJ, and are grouped into three subsets (Fig. 1a): (1) halogenases (Hals) embedded in CurA and JamE; (2) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) enzymecassettes containing a tandem acyl carrier protein (ACP) tridomain (ACP3) including ACPI, ACPII and ACPIII embedded in CurA and JamE, discrete CurB and JamFACPIVs,CurCand JamGketosynthase-like enzymes (KSs),CurD and JamHHMG-CoA synthase-like enzymes (HCSs), CurE and JamI ECH1s, and ECH2s embedded in CurF and JamJ; and (3) enoyl reduc-tase domains (ERs) embedded in CurF and JamJ (Fig. 1a). The sequence identities of the Cur and Jam Hals, ACP3s, ACPIVs, KSs, HCSs and ECH1s are extraordinarily high (,90%), whereas the ECH2s and ERs are substantially lower (,60% identity) (Fig. 1a). Our bioinformatic analysis suggests that a \u2018di-acyltransferase (AT) domain replacement\u2019 might have occurred to insert the parallel AT-Hal-ACPI-ACPII-ACPIII-ACPIV-KS-HCS-ECH1-ECH2-ER-KS-AT gene assembly into precursors of the modern Cur and Jam gene clusters by homologous recombination (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Cur and JamHals were predicted to be a-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haem Hals (less than 20% sequence identity to characterized homologues)8\u201310 that catalyse halogenation of unactivated carbon atoms9\u201313 through a non-haem Fe(IV)5O intermediate14. HMG enzyme cassettes have been demonstrated to catalyse polyketide on-assembly-line b-branching to generate a pendant methyl or ethyl group from a polyketide b-carbonyl15\u201317. Cur and Jam ERs show ,50% sequence identity to other ERs in Cur and Jam polyketide synthase modules, and belong to the acyl-CoA reductase family that catalyses NADPH-dependent reduction of a,b enoyl thioester in acyl-CoAs or acyl-ACPs18. HMG b-branching includes a series of modifications on the b-carbonyl group of a polyketide intermediate typically tethered to the tandem ACPs15\u201317. As illustrated for CurA (Fig. 1b), CurB malonyl-ACPIV, CurC KS and CurD HCS lead to formation of (S)-HMG-ACP3 (1-ACP3). As shown previously, ECH1 catalyses dehyd-ration of 1-ACP3 to 3-methylglutaconyl-ACP3 (2-ACP3), followed by ECH2 decarboxylation to generate 3-methylcrotonyl-ACP3 (3-ACP3) 15,19, a presumed precursor for (1R,2S)-2-methylcyclopropane-1-carboxyl-ACP3 (5-ACP3) (Fig. 1b). This initial study raised three important questions regarding the role of the Cur and Jam Hals, HMG enzyme cassettes, and ERs in the formation of cyclopropane *These authors contributed equally to this work. 1Life Sciences Institute, 2Department of Medicinal Chemistry, 3Department of Chemistry, 4Department of Biological Chemistry, 5Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA. 6Department of Chemistry and Center for Chemical Methodologies & Library Development, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA. 7Scripps Institution of Oceanography & Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.

All rights and vinyl chloride moieties: it is not clear (1) whether the CurF ER is involved in cyclopropyl ring formation, and based on its canonical function whether it can reduce 3-ACP3 to isovaleryl-ACP3 (4-ACP3) (Fig. 1b); (2) whether a chlorination step is involved in formation of the 5-ACP3 cyclopropane ring (Fig. 1b); and (3) how the unusual b,c C5C of the pendant vinyl chloride group is formed in the Jam path-way. As previously proposed, 3-methyl-3-butenoyl-ACP3 (6-ACP3) might be generated from 3-ACP3 by isomerization 2, or by differential regiochemical control of double-bond formation during ECH2 decar-boxylation19 (Fig. 1b). First, we tested whether CurF ER can saturate 3-ACP3, the previ-ously established product of Cur ECH2 15. The function of excised Cur ER was assessed by coupling it with the Cur ECH1 and ECH2 reac-tions. The substrates 1-ACPII and 1-ACP3 were prepared with HMG covalently linked to the phosphopantetheine arm20 of the ACP (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4), and mass changes were detected by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) methods. As reported15, Cur ECH1 catalysed the reversible dehyd-ration of 1-ACPII to generate 2-ACPII, and Cur ECH2 catalysed dec-arboxylation of 2-ACPII to generate 3-ACPII (Fig. 2b, c). Cur ECH1 showed substrate preference for (S)-HMG-ACPII over (R)-HMG-ACPII (Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013c), consistent with our previous results using the CoA-linked substrates15.

All rights NADPH, a 2-Damass addition was observed for 3-ACPII (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 6a), corresponding to saturation of the a,b enoyl thioester to generate 4-ACPII. To confirm the structure of the Cur ER reaction product tethered to ACP3, we cleaved it from the phospho-pantetheine arm with butylamine and analysed the corresponding butylamide derivative by gas chromatography (GC)-MS21 (Fig. 2i). We used 1-ACPII and 1-ACP3 as substrates for Cur ECH1, ECH2 and ER reactions, and their products were confirmed as 4 by correlation with authentic standards (Fig. 2i, upper trace). However, the relatively poor efficiency of Cur ER-catalysed reduction of 3-ACPII (see below) suggested that its native substrate remained to be identified. Given the above results, we reasoned that a chlorination stepmight be essential for cyclopropane ring formation. An important clue about the timing of chlorination at the b-branching carbon came from previous precursor-incorporation studies in curacin A biosyn-thesis (Supplementary Fig. 7). To identify the function of Cur Hal, it was purified anaerobically9,10 as an excised domain (Supplementary Fig. 3), treated with a mixture of metals and a-ketoglutarate, and shown by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to bind Fe21 preferentially (90%). Seven acyl-ACP substrates bearing the target pendant b-branching carbon were tested to establish the substrate identity for Cur Hal, including malonyl-ACPIV, acetyl-ACPIV, 1-ACPII, 2-ACPII, 3-ACPII, 4-ACPII and 6-ACPII (Fig. 1b). Consistent with the precursor-incorporation experiment noted above, we observed formation of the mono-chlorinated species exclusively on 1-ACPII to generate c-Cl-1-ACPII. The chlorinated product was confirmed by FTICR-MS and IRMPD analysis (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6a), and corroborated by GC-MS (see below, Fig. 3g). As expected, Cur Hal showed the same selectivity for (S)-HMG-ACPII (1-ACPII) as did Cur ECH1, andO2 and a-ketoglutarate dependence (Supplementary Fig. 5). Chlorination on a carboxylated c-carbon of HMG is unique for a-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haemHals, withprevious reports limited to unactivated substrates9\u201313. Next, we sought to investigate how the chlorination of 1-ACPII affects efficiency of the downstream reaction sequence with the HMG cassette enzymes. 1-ACPII was converted to c-Cl-1-ACPII by CurHal (Fig. 2e), and reacted sequentially with Cur ECH1, ECH2 and ER. ECH1 dehydrated c-Cl-1-ACPII and the c-Cl-2-ACPII product was decarboxylated by ECH2 to generate c-Cl-3-ACPII (Fig. 2f, g). The ECH1/ECH2-coupled dehydration and decarboxylation with c-Cl-1-ACPII was ,4-fold faster than with 1-ACPII (Supplementary Fig. 8), which might be due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the c-chlorine or tomore effective binding of the halogenated substrate in the enzyme active sites. Unexpectedly, when Cur ER was added with Cur ECH1 and ECH2 in the presence of c-Cl-1-ACPII, no saturation product was obtained. Instead, we observed a 34-Da mass reduction from c-Cl-3-ACPII (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 6a), demonstrating elimination of chlorine to yield 3-ACPII, 5-ACPII or 6-ACPII (Fig. 1b) as the putative product(s). To establish definitively the identity of the final product in the presence of bothHal andHMG-cassette enzymes, a one-pot reaction using Cur Hal-ACP3, ECH1, ECH2 and ER was performed, and the product was cleaved and analysed by GC-MS (Supplementary Methods). A single species was identified as the cis-2-methylcyclopropane-1-carboxyl compound (Fig. 2i, lower trace), demonstrating the formation of 5-ACP by an unprecedented ER-catalysed cyclopropanation reaction, presumably via an intramolecu-lar nucleophilic substitution. We next assessed whether Jam ER can catalyse cyclopropanation when presented with c-Cl-3-ACPII, owing to the similarity of Cur and Jam ERs (,65% sequence identity, Fig. 1a). Unexpectedly, Jam ER yielded only the saturated product, c-Cl-4-ACPII (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6b), indicating that it shows the activity of a canonical polyketide synthase ER domain. The distinct functions of Cur and Jam ERs motivated us to compare the catalytic efficiencies of Cur ER cyclopropanation against Jam ER saturation for the chlori-nated substrate, and the efficiencies of cyclopropanation for the chlori-nated substrate against saturation for the non-chlorinated substrate by Cur ER (Supplementary Fig. 9\u201311). This comparison confirmed that Jam ER has retained the canonical function as an a,b enoyl reductase, in contrast to the Cur ER as a cyclopropanase. The basis for vinyl chloride group formation in the Jam pathway remained to be established. Given the extraordinarily high similarity betweenCur and JamHals (92% sequence identity), we surmised that the two pathways diverge after the halogenation step. In the two assemblies, the Cur and Jam ECH2 domains have lowest sequence identities (59%) (Fig. 1a), and probably function as a key branch-point determinant. The functions of JamECH1 and ECH2were inves-tigated with Cur substrates starting from 1-ACP or c-Cl-1-ACPII to establish what controls introduction of the b,c vinyl chloride group. For both 1-ACPII and c-Cl-1-ACPII substrates, Jam ECH1 and ECH2 catalysed successive dehydration and decarboxylation steps as expected (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 12b, c, f, g). However, when Jam ER was included, only ,20% of the saturated product was detected for the non-chlorinated substrate (derived from 1-ACPII, Supplementary Fig. 12i). No product was observed for the corres-ponding chlorinated substrate (derived from c-Cl-1-ACPII, Supplementary Fig. 12j), indicating that the Jam ECH2 product is not a substrate for Jam ER. Thus, the Jam ECH2-catalysed decarbox-ylation product of c-Cl-2-ACPII was predicted to be c-Cl-6-ACPII (b,c C5C; Fig. 3d) with a vinyl chloride group, instead of c-Cl-3-ACPII (a,b C5C; Fig. 3a). Consistent with this prediction, Cur and Jam ECH2 decarboxylation products showed different ultraviolet absorption patterns between 250 and 280nm (Supplementary Fig. 13b), which distinguishes the isomeric a,b and b,c enoyl thioester functionality. To determine the structures of the decarboxylation products, one-pot reactions using Cur Hal-ACP3, Cur ECH1 and Cur or Jam ECH2s were performed as described above. The main product of Cur ECH2 contained primarily an a,b C5C in the E configuration, with trace g Obs.: 11757.8Calc.: 11757.9Obs.: 11757.8Calc.: 11757.9\u03b3-Cl-1-ACPII \u03b3-Cl-3-ACPII \u03b3-Cl-4-ACPII \u03b3-Cl-6-ACPII \u03b3-Cl-6-ACPII \u03b3-Cl-6-ACPII \u03b3-Cl-1-ACPII + + ECH2ECH1 CurCur Jam Jam ECH2ECH1 ERECH2ECH1 Cur Cur Cur ERECH2ECH1 Cur Cur Jam Jam ERECH2ECH1 Cur Jam Jam Jam ERECH2ECH15-ACPII \u201334 +2 976 980 984 988 976 980 984 988 S O Cl S O S O Cl S O Cl A C P II A C P II Cur ECH2ECH1 Cur Cur Cur ECH2ECH1 Jam Jam * * * S O OH O HO Hal ACP3 36 38 40 42 44 46 Retention time (min)4,000 0 8,000 SIM A b un d an ce Bu =Bu Bu Bu BuCl Cl Cl Cl N H N H N H N H OZ Z E O O O a b c d e f E m/zm/z Figure 3 | Comparison of ECH2s and ERs in Cur and Jam pathways. a\u2013f, Partial FTICRmass spectra (121 charge state of ACPII) for Cur and Jam ECH1, ECH2 and ER reactions with the c-Cl-1-ACPII substrate.

NATURE |Vol 459 |4 June 2009 LETTERS 733 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights amounts (,3%) of the b,c C5C isomer (Fig. 3g, upper trace). In contrast, Jam ECH2 showed high regiochemical control to generate exclusively the b,c C5C product, with,85% in the E configuration and,15% of the Z isomer (Fig. 3g, lower trace). The minor amount of Z conformation is probably due to the use of the Cur substrate, which is less bulky than the Jam substrate (Fig. 1a). Notably, Jam ECH2 decarboxylation had lower regiochemical control using the non-chlorinated substrate, and generated ,80% b,c C5C and ,20% a,b C5C products, which further explains the partial enoyl reduced product observed after Jam ECH1, ECH2 and ER reactions with this substrate (Supplementary Fig. 12i). Given the canonical function of ER to catalyse reduction of a,b enoyl thioesters, the selective formation of b,c C5C product by Jam ECH2 renders Jam ER superfluous in the biosynthesis of jamaicamides. In general, a,b C5C ECH2 products are energetically preferred and frequently identified or predicted in other pathways16,17,22\u201325, with the notable exception of pederin and its structural analogues26,27 (Supplementary Fig. 14). We sought to understand further the regiochemical control of ECH2-catalysed decarboxylation. The Cur ECH2 crystal structure 19 was modelled with the chlorinated substrate and site-directed muta-genesis experiments were performed to identify key residues for regio-chemical control (Supplementary Fig. 15). We compared the catalytic efficiencies of the wild type (WT) and mutants of Cur ECH2, and measured the ratios of the two possible decarboxylation products c-Cl-3-ACPII and c-Cl-6-ACPII (Supplementary Methods). The data revealed that positioning of a non-conserved Tyr 82 residue in a hyper-variable region of the enzyme active site is crucial for regioselective protonation after collapse of the presumed enolate intermediate (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 15a). This result suggests that ECH2 regiochemical control might be readily affected by mutations in this hypervariable region to provide functional group diversification. The Cur and Jam pathways enable us to witness the remarkable process of evolutionary diversification in secondarymetabolism. Both Cur and Jam contain Hal domains that were recruited and embedded in a modular polyketide synthase to impart new chemical diversity (Fig. 4a). Recent studies on this class of a-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haem Hals have reported them as being discrete enzymes in secondary metabolite pathways2,9\u201312, but this integrated domain represents an unprecedented example of pathway diversification. Cur and Jam are further diversified by the amino acid sequence vari-ation in downstream enzymes to yield different catalytic activities (Fig. 4a). Specifically, the Cur ER domain was shown to be a cyclo-propanase catalysing nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine atom leading to a highly strained and unusual functional group (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the Jam ER domain was found to retain reductase function for the Cur a,b enoylthioester substrate, but it is inactive against the corresponding b,c enoylthioester isomer. Thus, in addition to the cyclopropanation strategies of Zn21-dependent CmaC9,28 and the recently reported FAD-dependent dehydrogenase KtzA29 where chloride also serves as a leaving group, the NADPH-dependent Cur ER-catalysed cyclopropanation represents a new strategy for generat-ing a thioester enolate and subsequent ring formation. Structural insights to reveal Cur ER sequence variations that stabilize the a-carbanion while supporting closure of the highly strained cyclopro-pane are key to understanding its functional evolution. Further pathway diversification is reflected in select amino acid sequence changes that direct alternative double-bond regiochemistry in the Jamproducts (Fig. 4c).

All rights reveal their metamorphic properties for creating chemical diversity in biologically active natural products. METHODS SUMMARY All proteins used in the work were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. Specifically, the Cur Hal constructs were puri-fied anaerobically and reconstituted with Fe21 and a-ketoglutarate (refs 9, 10). FTICR-MSand IRMPDwere used to detectmass changes on acyl-ACPs. The acyl groups tethered to ACP phosphopantetheine arms were cleaved by butylamine aminolysis, and corresponding butylamide derivatives were subsequently ana-lysed by GC-MS and correlated with authentic standards for structure deter-mination. IRMPD-based quantification was developed to measure yields of the ER-mediated saturation and cyclopropanation reactions. Detailed experimental procedures are described in the Supplementary Methods.

        "Natural product chemical diversity is fuelled by the emergence and ongoing evolution of biosynthetic pathways in secondary meta-bolism1. However, co-evolution of enzymes for metabolic diver-sification is not well understood, especially at the biochemical level. Here, two parallel assemblies with an extraordinarily high sequence identity fromLyngbyamajuscula formab-branched cyclo-propane in the curacin A pathway (Cur), and a vinyl chloride group in the jamaicamide pathway (Jam). The components include a halo-genase, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl enzyme cassette for poly-ketide b-branching, and an enoyl reductase domain. The halogenase from CurA, and the dehydratases (ECH1s), decarboxylases (ECH2s) and enoyl reductase domains frombothCur and Jam,were assessed biochemically to determine the mechanisms of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride formation.Unexpectedly, the polyketide b-branching pathway was modified by introduction of a c-chlorination step on (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl mediated by Cur halogenase, a non-haem Fe(II), a-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme2. In a diver-gent scheme, Cur ECH2 was found to catalyse formation of the a,b enoyl thioester, whereas Jam ECH2 formed a vinyl chloride moiety by selectively generating the corresponding b,c enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chloroglutaconyl decarboxylation product. Finally, the enoyl reductase domain of CurF specifically catalysed an unprecedented cyclopropanation on the chlorinated product of Cur ECH2 instead of the canonical a,b C5C saturation reaction. Thus, the combination of chlorination and polyketide b-branching, coupled with mechanistic diversification of ECH2 and enoyl reduc-tase, leads to the formation of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride moieties. These results reveal a parallel interplay of evolutionary events inmultienzyme systems leading to functional groupdiversity in secondary metabolites.",
        "The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is \u2018diversity oriented\u20193,4, targeting the variable environment by producing a vast array of com-plex chemical structures. This productivity is largely fuelled by the rapid evolution of biosynthetic genes and functional alteration of the corresponding enzymes1,4. However, our current understanding of pathway diversification is largely based on genetic and bioinformatics approaches.",
        "The curacin and jamaicamide metabolites from Lyngbya majuscula are mixed-polyketide nonribosomal-peptide natural products with potent anticancer and sodiumchannel blocking activities, respectively5,6. The corresponding biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1a) provide an unusual opportunity to investigate the biosynthetic origin of chemical diversity. Within these dissimilar pathways, the parallel, highly conserved compo-nents catalyse formation of a cyclopropane ring for curacin and a vinyl chloride for jamaicamide5,7. Comparative biochemical studies on the variant functions and selectivities of these highly parallel biosynthetic components form the subject of this report.",
        "Two parallel Cur and Jam enzyme assemblies are incorporated into the early polyketide synthase modules, and are predicted to catalyse polyketide b-branching reactions in the growing chain elongation intermediates5,7. These catalytic domains and discrete enzymes span fromCurA toCurF and from JamE to JamJ, and are grouped into three subsets (Fig. 1a): (1) halogenases (Hals) embedded in CurA and JamE; (2) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) enzymecassettes containing a tandem acyl carrier protein (ACP) tridomain (ACP3) including ACPI, ACPII and ACPIII embedded in CurA and JamE, discrete CurB and JamFACPIVs,CurCand JamGketosynthase-like enzymes (KSs),CurD and JamHHMG-CoA synthase-like enzymes (HCSs), CurE and JamI ECH1s, and ECH2s embedded in CurF and JamJ; and (3) enoyl reduc-tase domains (ERs) embedded in CurF and JamJ (Fig. 1a). The sequence identities of the Cur and Jam Hals, ACP3s, ACPIVs, KSs, HCSs and ECH1s are extraordinarily high (,90%), whereas the ECH2s and ERs are substantially lower (,60% identity) (Fig. 1a). Our bioinformatic analysis suggests that a \u2018di-acyltransferase (AT) domain replacement\u2019 might have occurred to insert the parallel AT-Hal-ACPI-ACPII-ACPIII-ACPIV-KS-HCS-ECH1-ECH2-ER-KS-AT gene assembly into precursors of the modern Cur and Jam gene clusters by homologous recombination (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).",
        "Cur and JamHals were predicted to be a-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haem Hals (less than 20% sequence identity to characterized homologues)8\u201310 that catalyse halogenation of unactivated carbon atoms9\u201313 through a non-haem Fe(IV)5O intermediate14. HMG enzyme cassettes have been demonstrated to catalyse polyketide on-assembly-line b-branching to generate a pendant methyl or ethyl group from a polyketide b-carbonyl15\u201317. Cur and Jam ERs show ,50% sequence identity to other ERs in Cur and Jam polyketide synthase modules, and belong to the acyl-CoA reductase family that catalyses NADPH-dependent reduction of a,b enoyl thioester in acyl-CoAs or acyl-ACPs18.",
        "HMG b-branching includes a series of modifications on the b-carbonyl group of a polyketide intermediate typically tethered to the tandem ACPs15\u201317. As illustrated for CurA (Fig. 1b), CurB malonyl-ACPIV, CurC KS and CurD HCS lead to formation of (S)-HMG-ACP3 (1-ACP3). As shown previously, ECH1 catalyses dehyd-ration of 1-ACP3 to 3-methylglutaconyl-ACP3 (2-ACP3), followed by ECH2 decarboxylation to generate 3-methylcrotonyl-ACP3 (3-ACP3) 15,19, a presumed precursor for (1R,2S)-2-methylcyclopropane-1-carboxyl-ACP3 (5-ACP3) (Fig. 1b). This initial study raised three important questions regarding the role of the Cur and Jam Hals, HMG enzyme cassettes, and ERs in the formation of cyclopropane",

        "and vinyl chloride moieties: it is not clear (1) whether the CurF ER is involved in cyclopropyl ring formation, and based on its canonical function whether it can reduce 3-ACP3 to isovaleryl-ACP3 (4-ACP3) (Fig. 1b); (2) whether a chlorination step is involved in formation of the 5-ACP3 cyclopropane ring (Fig. 1b); and (3) how the unusual b,c C5C of the pendant vinyl chloride group is formed in the Jam path-way. As previously proposed, 3-methyl-3-butenoyl-ACP3 (6-ACP3) might be generated from 3-ACP3 by isomerization 2, or by differential regiochemical control of double-bond formation during ECH2 decar-boxylation19 (Fig. 1b). First, we tested whether CurF ER can saturate 3-ACP3, the previ-ously established product of Cur ECH2 15. The function of excised Cur ER was assessed by coupling it with the Cur ECH1 and ECH2 reac-tions. The substrates 1-ACPII and 1-ACP3 were prepared with HMG covalently linked to the phosphopantetheine arm20 of the ACP (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4), and mass changes were detected by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) methods. As reported15, Cur ECH1 catalysed the reversible dehyd-ration of 1-ACPII to generate 2-ACPII, and Cur ECH2 catalysed dec-arboxylation of 2-ACPII to generate 3-ACPII (Fig. 2b, c). Cur ECH1 showed substrate preference for (S)-HMG-ACPII over (R)-HMG-ACPII (Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013c), consistent with our previous results using the CoA-linked substrates15. With Cur ER and",

        "NADPH, a 2-Damass addition was observed for 3-ACPII (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 6a), corresponding to saturation of the a,b enoyl thioester to generate 4-ACPII. To confirm the structure of the Cur ER reaction product tethered to ACP3, we cleaved it from the phospho-pantetheine arm with butylamine and analysed the corresponding butylamide derivative by gas chromatography (GC)-MS21 (Fig. 2i). We used 1-ACPII and 1-ACP3 as substrates for Cur ECH1, ECH2 and ER reactions, and their products were confirmed as 4 by correlation with authentic standards (Fig. 2i, upper trace). However, the relatively poor efficiency of Cur ER-catalysed reduction of 3-ACPII (see below) suggested that its native substrate remained to be identified.",
        "Given the above results, we reasoned that a chlorination stepmight be essential for cyclopropane ring formation. An important clue about the timing of chlorination at the b-branching carbon came from previous precursor-incorporation studies in curacin A biosyn-thesis (Supplementary Fig. 7). To identify the function of Cur Hal, it was purified anaerobically9,10 as an excised domain (Supplementary Fig. 3), treated with a mixture of metals and a-ketoglutarate, and shown by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to bind Fe21 preferentially (90%). Seven acyl-ACP substrates bearing the target pendant b-branching carbon were tested to establish the substrate identity for Cur Hal, including malonyl-ACPIV, acetyl-ACPIV, 1-ACPII, 2-ACPII, 3-ACPII, 4-ACPII and 6-ACPII (Fig. 1b). Consistent with the precursor-incorporation experiment noted above, we observed formation of the mono-chlorinated species exclusively on 1-ACPII to generate c-Cl-1-ACPII. The chlorinated product was confirmed by FTICR-MS and IRMPD analysis (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6a), and corroborated by GC-MS (see below, Fig. 3g). As expected, Cur Hal showed the same selectivity for (S)-HMG-ACPII (1-ACPII) as did Cur ECH1, andO2 and a-ketoglutarate dependence (Supplementary Fig. 5). Chlorination on a carboxylated c-carbon of HMG is unique for a-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haemHals, withprevious reports limited to unactivated substrates9\u201313.",
        "Next, we sought to investigate how the chlorination of 1-ACPII affects efficiency of the downstream reaction sequence with the HMG cassette enzymes. 1-ACPII was converted to c-Cl-1-ACPII by CurHal (Fig. 2e), and reacted sequentially with Cur ECH1, ECH2 and ER. ECH1 dehydrated c-Cl-1-ACPII and the c-Cl-2-ACPII product was decarboxylated by ECH2 to generate c-Cl-3-ACPII (Fig. 2f, g). The ECH1/ECH2-coupled dehydration and decarboxylation with c-Cl-1-ACPII was ,4-fold faster than with 1-ACPII (Supplementary Fig. 8), which might be due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the c-chlorine or tomore effective binding of the halogenated substrate in the enzyme active sites. Unexpectedly, when Cur ER was added with Cur ECH1 and ECH2 in the presence of c-Cl-1-ACPII, no saturation product was obtained. Instead, we observed a 34-Da mass reduction from c-Cl-3-ACPII (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 6a), demonstrating elimination of chlorine to yield 3-ACPII, 5-ACPII or 6-ACPII (Fig. 1b) as the putative product(s). To establish definitively the identity of the final product in the presence of bothHal andHMG-cassette enzymes, a one-pot reaction using Cur Hal-ACP3, ECH1, ECH2 and ER was performed, and the product was cleaved and analysed by GC-MS (Supplementary Methods). A single species was identified as the cis-2-methylcyclopropane-1-carboxyl compound (Fig. 2i, lower trace), demonstrating the formation of 5-ACP by an unprecedented ER-catalysed cyclopropanation reaction, presumably via an intramolecu-lar nucleophilic substitution.",
        "We next assessed whether Jam ER can catalyse cyclopropanation when presented with c-Cl-3-ACPII, owing to the similarity of Cur and Jam ERs (,65% sequence identity, Fig. 1a). Unexpectedly, Jam ER yielded only the saturated product, c-Cl-4-ACPII (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6b), indicating that it shows the activity of a canonical polyketide synthase ER domain. The distinct functions of Cur and Jam ERs motivated us to compare the catalytic efficiencies of Cur ER cyclopropanation against Jam ER saturation for the chlori-nated substrate, and the efficiencies of cyclopropanation for the chlori-nated substrate against saturation for the non-chlorinated substrate by Cur ER (Supplementary Fig. 9\u201311). This comparison confirmed that Jam ER has retained the canonical function as an a,b enoyl reductase, in contrast to the Cur ER as a cyclopropanase.",
        "The basis for vinyl chloride group formation in the Jam pathway remained to be established. Given the extraordinarily high similarity betweenCur and JamHals (92% sequence identity), we surmised that the two pathways diverge after the halogenation step. In the two assemblies, the Cur and Jam ECH2 domains have lowest sequence identities (59%) (Fig. 1a), and probably function as a key branch-point determinant. The functions of JamECH1 and ECH2were inves-tigated with Cur substrates starting from 1-ACP or c-Cl-1-ACPII to establish what controls introduction of the b,c vinyl chloride group. For both 1-ACPII and c-Cl-1-ACPII substrates, Jam ECH1 and ECH2 catalysed successive dehydration and decarboxylation steps as expected (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 12b, c, f, g). However, when Jam ER was included, only ,20% of the saturated product was detected for the non-chlorinated substrate (derived from 1-ACPII, Supplementary Fig. 12i). No product was observed for the corres-ponding chlorinated substrate (derived from c-Cl-1-ACPII, Supplementary Fig. 12j), indicating that the Jam ECH2 product is not a substrate for Jam ER. Thus, the Jam ECH2-catalysed decarbox-ylation product of c-Cl-2-ACPII was predicted to be c-Cl-6-ACPII (b,c C5C; Fig. 3d) with a vinyl chloride group, instead of c-Cl-3-ACPII (a,b C5C; Fig. 3a). Consistent with this prediction, Cur and Jam ECH2 decarboxylation products showed different ultraviolet absorption patterns between 250 and 280nm (Supplementary Fig. 13b), which distinguishes the isomeric a,b and b,c enoyl thioester functionality.",
        "To determine the structures of the decarboxylation products, one-pot reactions using Cur Hal-ACP3, Cur ECH1 and Cur or Jam ECH2s were performed as described above. The main product of Cur ECH2 contained primarily an a,b C5C in the E configuration, with trace",

        "amounts (,3%) of the b,c C5C isomer (Fig. 3g, upper trace). In contrast, Jam ECH2 showed high regiochemical control to generate exclusively the b,c C5C product, with,85% in the E configuration and,15% of the Z isomer (Fig. 3g, lower trace). The minor amount of Z conformation is probably due to the use of the Cur substrate, which is less bulky than the Jam substrate (Fig. 1a). Notably, Jam ECH2 decarboxylation had lower regiochemical control using the non-chlorinated substrate, and generated ,80% b,c C5C and ,20% a,b C5C products, which further explains the partial enoyl reduced product observed after Jam ECH1, ECH2 and ER reactions with this substrate (Supplementary Fig. 12i). Given the canonical function of ER to catalyse reduction of a,b enoyl thioesters, the selective formation of b,c C5C product by Jam ECH2 renders Jam ER superfluous in the biosynthesis of jamaicamides. In general, a,b C5C ECH2 products are energetically preferred and frequently identified or predicted in other pathways16,17,22\u201325, with the notable exception of pederin and its structural analogues26,27 (Supplementary Fig. 14). We sought to understand further the regiochemical control of ECH2-catalysed decarboxylation. The Cur ECH2 crystal structure 19 was modelled with the chlorinated substrate and site-directed muta-genesis experiments were performed to identify key residues for regio-chemical control (Supplementary Fig. 15). We compared the catalytic efficiencies of the wild type (WT) and mutants of Cur ECH2, and measured the ratios of the two possible decarboxylation products c-Cl-3-ACPII and c-Cl-6-ACPII (Supplementary Methods). The data revealed that positioning of a non-conserved Tyr 82 residue in a hyper-variable region of the enzyme active site is crucial for regioselective protonation after collapse of the presumed enolate intermediate (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 15a). This result suggests that ECH2 regiochemical control might be readily affected by mutations in this hypervariable region to provide functional group diversification. The Cur and Jam pathways enable us to witness the remarkable process of evolutionary diversification in secondarymetabolism. Both Cur and Jam contain Hal domains that were recruited and embedded in a modular polyketide synthase to impart new chemical diversity (Fig. 4a). Recent studies on this class of a-ketoglutarate-dependent non-haem Hals have reported them as being discrete enzymes in secondary metabolite pathways2,9\u201312, but this integrated domain represents an unprecedented example of pathway diversification. Cur and Jam are further diversified by the amino acid sequence vari-ation in downstream enzymes to yield different catalytic activities (Fig. 4a). Specifically, the Cur ER domain was shown to be a cyclo-propanase catalysing nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine atom leading to a highly strained and unusual functional group (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the Jam ER domain was found to retain reductase function for the Cur a,b enoylthioester substrate, but it is inactive against the corresponding b,c enoylthioester isomer. Thus, in addition to the cyclopropanation strategies of Zn21-dependent CmaC9,28 and the recently reported FAD-dependent dehydrogenase KtzA29 where chloride also serves as a leaving group, the NADPH-dependent Cur ER-catalysed cyclopropanation represents a new strategy for generat-ing a thioester enolate and subsequent ring formation. Structural insights to reveal Cur ER sequence variations that stabilize the a-carbanion while supporting closure of the highly strained cyclopro-pane are key to understanding its functional evolution. Further pathway diversification is reflected in select amino acid sequence changes that direct alternative double-bond regiochemistry in the Jamproducts (Fig. 4c). These parallel yet distinct systems demonstrate the mutability of enzymes within complex metabolic pathways, and",
