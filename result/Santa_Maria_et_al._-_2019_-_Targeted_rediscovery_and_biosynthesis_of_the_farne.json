O\u2019Neill, and Bo Li*[a] Dedicated to Prof. Christopher T. Walsh on the occasion of his 75th birthday. The natural product pepticinnamin E potently inhibits protein farnesyl transferases and has potential applications in treating cancer and malaria. Pepticinnamin E contains a rare N-terminal cinnamoyl moiety as well as several nonproteinogenic amino acids, including the unusual 2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-N-methyl-L-phenylalanine. The biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E has remained uncharacterized because its original producing strain is no longer available. Here we identified a gene cluster (pcm) for this natural product in a new producer, Actinobacteria bacterium OK006, by means of a targeted rediscovery strategy. We demonstrated that the pcm cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E, a nonribosomal peptide/poly-ketide hybrid. We also characterized a key O-methyltransferase that modifies 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine. Our work has identified the gene cluster for pepticinnamins for the first time and sets the stage for elucidating the unique chemistry re-quired for biosynthesis. Living organisms synthesize an astounding number of natural products, many of which have important uses in medicine and biotechnology. Although tens of thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified from the genomes of bacte-ria, relatively few have been characterized in terms of the natu-ral products they produce. Additionally, although many bioac-tive natural products have been isolated, their biosynthetic gene clusters remain undetermined. Examples include the neu-rotoxin tetrodotoxin,[1] the psychoactive drug ibotenic acid,[2] and the anticancer agent acivicin,[3] isolated from marine ani-mals, mushrooms, and bacteria, respectively. The lack of knowl-edge relating to the biosynthesis of these natural products limits the ability to study and engineer these compounds. The pepticinnamins were discovered in 1992 as farnesyl-transferase inhibitors.[4] Farnesyl-transferase inhibitors have been explored both for cancer therapy and as potential treat-ments for malaria and trypanosomiasis.[5] Six pepticinnamin variants, A\u2013F, have been isolated; among them, pepticinna-min E is the most abundant and thoroughly characterized. Pepticinnamin E is composed of a cinnamoyl tail, a highly modified tripeptide core, and an ester-linked diketopiperazine unit (Scheme 1).[6] The tripeptide core contains three nonpro-teinogenic aromatic amino acids: d-tyrosine, N-methyl-2-chloro-4-O-methyl-3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (N-Me-2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA), and N-methyl-l-phenylalanine (N-Me-l-Phe). The diketopiperazine unit consists of a d-serine and a glycine. Total synthesis of pepticinnamin E and its epimer revealed that the second amino acid in the natural product possesses S ste-reochemistry and is N-Me-2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA.[7] Mode of action studies revealed that pepticinnamin E acts as a natural bisubstrate inhibitor of farnesyl transferases and several ana-logues induce apoptosis in tumor cells.[8] The unique structure of pepticinnamin E suggests that its biosynthesis requires unusual enzymatic chemistry. The 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA component, for example, is a rare nonproteino-genic amino acid in nonribosomal peptides. Diketopiperazine formation is an unusual strategy for release of peptide natural products from nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Identifying the biosynthetic gene cluster for a given natural product generally requires access to the producing microbe or the genome sequence of the producer. However, the original strain from which pepticinnamin was isolated\u2014Streptomyces sp. OH-4652\u2014has not been sequenced and is not readily ac-cessible, thus posing a significant challenge for studying the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E. To overcome this challenge, we set out to identify new pep-ticinnamin producers by bioinformatics. Many natural products have been identified from more than one bacterial strain, due to horizontal gene transfer of their biosynthetic gene clusters. This phenomenon has caused substantial natural product re-discovery problems.[9] We reasoned, though, that we could take advantage of this phenomenon and of the growing mi-crobial genome databases to identify the biosynthetic gene clusters for natural products for which the original producers are unavailable. Using this targeted rediscovery strategy, we identified a new bacterial producer for pepticinnamin E\u2014Acti-nobacteria bacterium OK006\u2014and determined the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for its biosynthesis. Additionally, we reconstituted the activity of the methyltransferase responsible for the formation of 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA and characterized the substrate scope of this enzyme. Analysis of the pepticinnamin E structure revealed that it possesses an N-terminal cinnamoyl lipid moiety similar to that present in the natural product skyllamycin A and identical to that found in the natural product WS9326A (Scheme 1).[10] The biosynthetic gene clusters for skyllamycin A and WS9326A have been identified and are both polyketide synthase (PKS)-[a] K.

Specifically, Sky28 (GenBank ac-cession No. AEA30 271.1) was used as a query for a BLASTP search against the Joint Genomic Institute\u2019s Integrated Microbi-al Genome Database. The top 500 hits were inspected for proximity of NRPS genes, and further analyzed by anti-SMASH 3.0 and MultiGeneBlast against the MiBiG database.[12] This analysis enabled us to identify a putative 45 kb gene clus-ter for pepticinnamin biosynthesis\u2014pcm\u2014in A. bacterium OK006, a Streptomyces strain isolated from the root endo-sphere of a poplar tree.[13] This cluster encodes a gene prod-uct\u2014Pcm9\u2014that is 58 % identical to Sky28 (Scheme 2 C). It also harbors a number of NRPS and PKS genes. The core PKS genes in this cluster share high sequence identity with those in the clusters for skyllamycin and WS9326 that are involved in Bo Li earned her Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2009.

Structures of PKS-NRPS hybrid natural products containing cinnamoyl moieties. Cinnamoyl moieties are highlighted in blue, and nonproteinogenic biosynthesis of the cinnamoyl moiety (Scheme 2 C, Table S1 in the Supporting Information). We conducted further analysis of the two NRPSs\u2014Pcm2 and Pcm30\u2014in this cluster using NRPSpredictor 2,[14] and identified a total of five modules: two in Pcm2 and three in Pcm30. Sub-strate prediction based on bioinformatics suggested that the adenylation (A) domains in modules 1\u20135 prefer tyrosine, tyro-sine, phenylalanine, serine, and glycine, respectively (Scheme 2 C, Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The pre-dicted substrate preference matches the composition of the core peptide in pepticinnamin E. Additionally, module 2 in Pcm2 and module 3 in Pcm30 each contain a methyltransfer-ase domain (Scheme 2 C), consistent with the N-methyl groups present in the peptide backbone of pepticinnamin E at the second and third amino acids. We also identified three potential tailoring enzymes for the formation of 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA in pepticinnamin E: Pcm1 (a flavin-dependent halogenase), Pcm11 (a biopterin-dependent hydroxylase), and Pcm10 [a methyltransferase dependent on S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)]. These enzymes are of particular interest because halogenation of aromatic residues typically occurs at the 3-and 4-postions rather than at the 2-position as found in 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA. Additionally, hydroxylations in bacterial nonribosomal peptide pathways are often catalyzed by cytochrome P450 or non-heme iron/a-ketoglutarate-depen-dent enzymes;[15] biopterin-dependent hydroxylases, essential for the metabolism of aromatic amino acids and the synthesis of neurotransmitters in mammals, are relatively rare in bacte-ria.[16] On the basis of these bioinformatic evidence, we hy-pothesized that this cluster encodes biosynthetic enzymes for pepticinnamin production. We set out to test this hypothesis and to characterize the unusual tailoring enzymes. Having identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster for pepticinnamin E from A. bacterium OK006, we first examined the ability of this strain to produce pepticinnamin E. The bacte-rium was cultured in different media to elicit pepticinnamin production, and the resulting cell pellets were extracted with methanol. The extracts were then analyzed by liquid chroma-tography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis. We identified peaks with mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 908.356 and 930.345, corresponding to [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ adducts, respectively, of pepticinnamin E. In-source mass fragmentation yielded product ions with m/z of 603.223 and 547.191, which correspond to the b and y ions, respective-ly, at the 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA residue (Figures 1 A and S1). 1H NMR analysis of isolated pepticinnamin E also supports the reported structure (Figure S2 and Table S3), but we did not de-termine the stereochemistry of the isolated product. These re-sults demonstrated that A. bacterium OK006 is a new producer of pepticinnamin E. To validate the hypothesis that the pcm cluster is responsi-ble for the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E, we disrupted pcm2 by generating insertional mutants, each with a single-crossover apramycin resistance cassette. Attempts at double-crossover mutants were unsuccessful. Growth and extraction of the mutant strains under the same conditions as used for the wild-type bacterium yielded no pepticinnamin E detectable by UV absorption or MS (Figure 1 B). This result confirms that pcm is the biosynthetic gene cluster for pepticinnamin E. Pcm10 shares 58 % sequence identity with SafC, a character-ized catechol 4-O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthe-sis of saframycin MX1.[17] Therefore, we hypothesized that Pcm10 might catalyze O-methylation of l-DOPA and of deriva-tives of l-DOPA. To characterize the function of Pcm10, we cloned, expressed, and purified a His-tagged version in E. coli. The activity of Pcm10 was reconstituted in a buffered solution containing SAM and l-DOPA at 28 8C. A methylated l-DOPA product was detected by LC-HRMS, and its production was abolished in assay mixtures containing boiled Pcm10. This result indicated that Pcm10 converts l-DOPA into methylated l-DOPA. To identify the position of methylation, the methylat-ed l-DOPA product from a 10 mL overnight Pcm10 reaction was purified and subjected to 1H NMR analysis (Figure S3). The 1H shifts are consistent with those reported for 4-methyl-l-DOPA,[18] but differ from those of 3-methyl-l-DOPA.[19] This result indicated that Pcm10 methylates l-DOPA at the 4-hy-droxy position, consistent with the structure of pepticinna-min E. No methyltransfer activity was observed when Pcm10 was incubated with l-tyrosine, thus suggesting that hydroxyl-ation of l-tyrosine occurs prior to 4-methylation. To probe the substrate scope of Pcm10, we tested catechol and its derivatives, including dopamine, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acid, as substrates for Pcm10. Pcm10 did not modify catechol, but converted &50 % of dopamine and more than 70 % of caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid into their methy-Figure 1. The pcm cluster is responsible for pepticinnamin E biosynthesis. lated products during the incubation period (Scheme 3, Fig-ures S4 and S5). The activity of Pcm10 toward these substrates is comparable with that towards l-DOPA as a substrate under the same conditions. The regiochemistry of the methylated products in the cases of dopamine, caffeic acid, or chlorogenic acid was not determined. The shapes of the product peaks for these non-native substrates suggest that Pcm10 may not be regioselective toward these substrates (Figure S4). These re-sults indicate that Pcm10 is a promiscuous methyltransferase of modified catechols. SafC can also methylate catechol deriva-tives and is regioselective for l-DOPA, but not the non-native substrates.[17] These observations are explained by a recent structural study that revealed the active site of SafC to be plas-tic; it can accommodate a variety of catechol substrates, and the regioselectivity of SafC is largely substrate-dependent.[20] We conducted additional bioinformatic analyses to charac-terize the timing of hydroxylation and other tailoring reactions in the generation of 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA. The amino acid pre-cursor is likely activated by the second A domain of Pcm2 (Pcm2-A2). Pcm2-A2 shares 56 % sequence identity with the previous A domain (Pcm2-A1) that likely activates Tyr1 of pep-ticinnamin E. It also possesses a 10-residue specificity code nearly identical to that in Pcm2-A1 and another Tyr-activating A domain in the NRPS NosD,[21] suggesting that l-Tyr is the pre-ferred substrate for Pcm2-A2. Further, phylogenetic analysis of Pcm1 revealed that it groups with flavin-dependent halogenas-es SgcC3 and BhaA,[22] which prefer thiolation-domain (T)-teth-ered substrates, rather than with those that prefer free sub-strates (Figure S6). Lastly, the promiscuity of Pcm10 toward modified catechols suggests that methylation through the action of Pcm10 could occur with substrates (l-DOPA or 2-chloro-l-DOPA) loaded onto Pcm2 as T-tethered thioesters. Therefore, in the biosynthesis of 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA, l-Tyr is likely first loaded onto the second T domain of Pcm2, followed by hydroxylation through the action of Pcm11, chlorination through that of Pcm1, and O-methylation through that of Pcm10. Modification of T-domain-tethered substrates has also been reported in many NRPS biosynthetic pathways.[23] This strategy might control the flux of the amino acid precursor into natural product biosynthesis and reduce the formation of unnecessary intermediates. From our experimental results and bioinformatic analyses, we propose a pathway for pepticinnamin E biosynthesis (Scheme 4). Each module is responsible for the activation and loading of the corresponding amino acid, condensation with the downstream amino acid, and methylation of the amide NH group in the cases of the second and third amino acids. Be-sides the canonical NRPS chemistry, a few domains in the path-way may catalyze unusual chemistry. Two out of the five amino acids in pepticinnamin E\u2014Tyr1 and Ser4\u2014exhibit d ste-reochemistry. Although d-amino acids in nonribosomal pep-tides often results from the epimerase activity of condensation (C) domains, the C domains in the pcm pathway exhibit no sig-nificant similarity to those with dual epimerase/condensation functions (Figure S7). In fact, phylogenetic analysis revealed that C domains in modules 2\u20135 all group with LCL domains that catalyze amide formation between two l-configured amino acids, whereas the first C domain groups with starter domains (Figure S7). Additionally, N-Me-Phe3 and Ser4 are con-nected through an ester linkage. A standalone C domain, SgcC5, in the C-1027 gene cluster has been shown to catalyze ester bond formation between the benzoxazolinate and the enediyne core.[24] Other C domains have also been associated with nonribosomal peptide chain extension through ester bonds in the pathways for kutzneride,[25] valinomycin,[26] and cereulide.[27] Thus, the fourth C domain (C4) in Pcm30 may di-rectly catalyze ester bond formation or facilitate the rearrange-ment from an amide to an ester. However, like in the case of SgcC5, no significant changes in the conserved residues are observed in that of Pcm30-C4. The ester linkage allows the amine moiety of Ser4 to condense with Gly5, forming the C-terminal diketopiperazine. Diketopiperazine formation may be catalyzed by the terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of Pcm30. However, sequence analysis of Pcm30-TE identified the con-served GxSxG motif but did not suggest any unusual features. Further, phylogenetic analysis revealed no distinct grouping with any subtypes of TE domains (Figure S8). The functions and mechanisms of the C and TE domains in the pepticinna-min pathway remain to be characterized. In summary, we have employed a bioinformatic approach to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of pepticinnamin E and to discover a new producing bacterium for this natural prod-uct. We also identified and characterized an O-methyltransfer-ase enzyme in the biosynthesis of the rare nonproteinogenic amino acid 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA and demonstrated that this enzyme is promiscuous toward a variety of catechol deriva-tives. Our work sets the stage for elucidating the biosynthetic chemistry of pepticinnamin E, especially the timing and mech-Scheme 3. Pcm10 is a promiscuous O-methyltransferase that modifies cate-anisms of biopterin-dependent hydroxylation, chlorination, and diketopiperazine formation. Experimental Section Cultivation of A. bacterium OK006 and extraction of pepticinna-min E : A. bacterium OK006 was cultivated on ISP Medium No. 4 (ISP4) plates (BD Difco) at 28 8C. Liquid cultures were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB, BD Difco) at 28 8C for 24 h with aeration. For production of pepticinnamin E, a sample of this TSB liquid culture (1 mL) was used to inoculate pepticinnamin production medium [d-glucose (20 g L@1), asparagine (10 g L@1), magnesium sulfate hep-tahydrate (0.2 g L@1), potassium phosphate dibasic (anhydrous, 0.5 g L@1), iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (0.02 g L@1), sodium chloride (5.84 g L@1), 200 mL], and grown for five days at 28 8C with shaking at 250 rpm. To extract pepticinnamin E, cultures were centrifuged at 4000 g for 1 h to harvest bacterial cells. The cell pellets were re-suspended in methanol and gently rocked for 2 h. After centrifuga-tion at 4500 g for 30 min, the methanol extract was filtered through 0.2 mm syringe filters and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The resulting extracts were dissolved in metha-nol for analysis by LC-HRMS. For LC-HRMS analysis, a sample (10 mL) was analyzed with an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity II Scheme 4. Proposed biosynthetic pathway to pepticinnamin E. LC system coupled to an Agilent Technologies 6520 accurate-mass Q-TOF instrument. Samples were separated on a Gemini NX-C18 column (Phenomenex, 110 a, 5 mm, 50 mm V 2 mm) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min@1 over a linear gradient of 2 to 98 % acetonitrile con-taining 0.1 % formic acid over 20 min. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was conducted in positive ion mode with the following parameters: gas temperature 350 8C, drying gas 12 L min@1, nebulizer 50 lb in@2, fragmentor 175 V, skimmer 65 V, ca-pillary cap 3500 V, octopole RF 750 V. Reconstitution of Pcm10 methyltransferase activity and analysis by LC-HRMS : The activity of Pcm10 was reconstituted as follows. Each 100 mL reaction mixture contained Tris (pH 8.3, 50 mm), NaCl (200 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), SAM (1.6 mm), and substrate (1 mm). Re-actions were initiated by addition of Pcm (104 mL) to a final con-centration of 9.2 mm, and the mixtures were incubated for 1.5 h at 28 8C and 750 rpm and quenched by the addition of 1 volume of trichloroacetic acid (10 %) to precipitate proteins in the assay. Reac-tion mixtures were stored at @20 8C prior to LC-HRMS analysis, at which point the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifuga-tion at 21 700 g for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted 1:2 in H2O, and the diluted sample (10 mL) was analyzed with an Agilent Tech-nologies 6520 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC-HRMS. Samples were sepa-rated on a Kinetex C18 column (Phenomenex, 100 a, 5 mm, 150 mm V 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min@1 over a linear gra-dient of 5 to 95 % acetonitrile containing 0.1 % formic acid over 25 min. ESI-MS was conducted in positive ion mode with the fol-lowing parameters: gas temperature 350 8C, drying gas 12 L min@1, nebulizer 50 lb in@2, fragmentor 175 V, skimmer 65 V, capillary cap 3500 V, octopole RF 750 V. Assay mixtures containing catechol as a substrate were analyzed by ESI-MS in negative ion mode with the following parameters: gas temperature 350 8C, drying gas 5 L min@1, nebulizer 20 lb in@2, fragmentor 175 V, skimmer 65 V, ca-pillary cap 3500 V, octopole RF 750 V. Analysis of the substrate scope of Pcm10 was performed under the same conditions with the different substrates (1 mm). After 3 h in-cubation, the reaction mixtures were quenched with 1 volume of trichloroacetic acid (10 %) and stored at @20 8C. Prior to HPLC anal-ysis, samples were centrifuged at 21 000 g for 5 min to remove the protein precipitants and neutralized with NaOH solution. A sample (20 mL) was injected onto a Kinetex C18 column (Phenomenex, 100 a, 5 mm, 150 mm V 4.6 mm) and analyzed by Shimadzu analyti-cal HPLC with use of a gradient of 2.5!20 % solvent B over 10 min for l-DOPA and l-Tyr, and a gradient of 2.5!50 % solvent B over 10 min for catechol, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and dopamine (solvent A: water containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: acetonitrile containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid). Substrate con-sumption and product formation in the reaction was calculated from the integrated peak areas of UV absorbance at 280 nm at spe-cific retention times.

        "The natural product pepticinnamin E potently inhibits protein farnesyl transferases and has potential applications in treating cancer and malaria. Pepticinnamin E contains a rare N-terminal cinnamoyl moiety as well as several nonproteinogenic amino acids, including the unusual 2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-N-methyl-L-phenylalanine. The biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E has remained uncharacterized because its original producing strain is no longer available. Here we identified a gene cluster (pcm) for this natural product in a new producer, Actinobacteria bacterium OK006, by means of a targeted rediscovery strategy. We demonstrated that the pcm cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E, a nonribosomal peptide/poly-ketide hybrid. We also characterized a key O-methyltransferase that modifies 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine. Our work has identified the gene cluster for pepticinnamins for the first time and sets the stage for elucidating the unique chemistry re-quired for biosynthesis.",
        "Living organisms synthesize an astounding number of natural products, many of which have important uses in medicine and biotechnology. Although tens of thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified from the genomes of bacte-ria, relatively few have been characterized in terms of the natu-ral products they produce. Additionally, although many bioac-tive natural products have been isolated, their biosynthetic gene clusters remain undetermined. Examples include the neu-rotoxin tetrodotoxin,[1] the psychoactive drug ibotenic acid,[2] and the anticancer agent acivicin,[3] isolated from marine ani-mals, mushrooms, and bacteria, respectively. The lack of knowl-edge relating to the biosynthesis of these natural products limits the ability to study and engineer these compounds.",
        "The pepticinnamins were discovered in 1992 as farnesyl-transferase inhibitors.[4] Farnesyl-transferase inhibitors have been explored both for cancer therapy and as potential treat-ments for malaria and trypanosomiasis.[5] Six pepticinnamin variants, A\u2013F, have been isolated; among them, pepticinna-min E is the most abundant and thoroughly characterized. Pepticinnamin E is composed of a cinnamoyl tail, a highly",
        "modified tripeptide core, and an ester-linked diketopiperazine unit (Scheme 1).[6] The tripeptide core contains three nonpro-teinogenic aromatic amino acids: d-tyrosine, N-methyl-2-chloro-4-O-methyl-3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (N-Me-2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA), and N-methyl-l-phenylalanine (N-Me-l-Phe). The diketopiperazine unit consists of a d-serine and a glycine. Total synthesis of pepticinnamin E and its epimer revealed that the second amino acid in the natural product possesses S ste-reochemistry and is N-Me-2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA.[7] Mode of action studies revealed that pepticinnamin E acts as a natural bisubstrate inhibitor of farnesyl transferases and several ana-logues induce apoptosis in tumor cells.[8] The unique structure of pepticinnamin E suggests that its biosynthesis requires unusual enzymatic chemistry. The 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA component, for example, is a rare nonproteino-genic amino acid in nonribosomal peptides. Diketopiperazine formation is an unusual strategy for release of peptide natural products from nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Identifying the biosynthetic gene cluster for a given natural product generally requires access to the producing microbe or the genome sequence of the producer. However, the original strain from which pepticinnamin was isolated\u2014Streptomyces sp. OH-4652\u2014has not been sequenced and is not readily ac-cessible, thus posing a significant challenge for studying the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E. To overcome this challenge, we set out to identify new pep-ticinnamin producers by bioinformatics. Many natural products have been identified from more than one bacterial strain, due to horizontal gene transfer of their biosynthetic gene clusters. This phenomenon has caused substantial natural product re-discovery problems.[9] We reasoned, though, that we could take advantage of this phenomenon and of the growing mi-crobial genome databases to identify the biosynthetic gene clusters for natural products for which the original producers are unavailable. Using this targeted rediscovery strategy, we identified a new bacterial producer for pepticinnamin E\u2014Acti-nobacteria bacterium OK006\u2014and determined the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for its biosynthesis. Additionally, we reconstituted the activity of the methyltransferase responsible for the formation of 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA and characterized the substrate scope of this enzyme. Analysis of the pepticinnamin E structure revealed that it possesses an N-terminal cinnamoyl lipid moiety similar to that present in the natural product skyllamycin A and identical to that found in the natural product WS9326A (Scheme 1).[10] The biosynthetic gene clusters for skyllamycin A and WS9326A have been identified and are both polyketide synthase (PKS)-",

        "NRPS hybrids (Scheme 2 A and B).[11] It has been proposed that the formation of the benzene ring in the cinnamoyl moiety of skyllamycin A is catalyzed either by the putative oxidoreduc-tase Sky4 or by the phytoene-dehydrogenase-like enzyme Sky28.[11a] Therefore, we used Sky28 as a biosynthetic \u201chook\u201d to identify gene clusters that might encode enzymes for the syn-thesis of the cinnamoyl moiety. Specifically, Sky28 (GenBank ac-cession No. AEA30 271.1) was used as a query for a BLASTP search against the Joint Genomic Institute\u2019s Integrated Microbi-al Genome Database. The top 500 hits were inspected for proximity of NRPS genes, and further analyzed by anti-SMASH 3.0 and MultiGeneBlast against the MiBiG database.[12]",
        "This analysis enabled us to identify a putative 45 kb gene clus-ter for pepticinnamin biosynthesis\u2014pcm\u2014in A. bacterium OK006, a Streptomyces strain isolated from the root endo-sphere of a poplar tree.[13] This cluster encodes a gene prod-uct\u2014Pcm9\u2014that is 58 % identical to Sky28 (Scheme 2 C).

        "We conducted further analysis of the two NRPSs\u2014Pcm2 and Pcm30\u2014in this cluster using NRPSpredictor 2,[14] and identified a total of five modules: two in Pcm2 and three in Pcm30. Sub-strate prediction based on bioinformatics suggested that the adenylation (A) domains in modules 1\u20135 prefer tyrosine, tyro-sine, phenylalanine, serine, and glycine, respectively (Scheme 2 C, Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The pre-dicted substrate preference matches the composition of the core peptide in pepticinnamin E. Additionally, module 2 in Pcm2 and module 3 in Pcm30 each contain a methyltransfer-ase domain (Scheme 2 C), consistent with the N-methyl groups present in the peptide backbone of pepticinnamin E at the second and third amino acids.",
        "We also identified three potential tailoring enzymes for the formation of 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA in pepticinnamin E: Pcm1 (a flavin-dependent halogenase), Pcm11 (a biopterin-dependent hydroxylase), and Pcm10 [a methyltransferase dependent on S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)]. These enzymes are of particular interest because halogenation of aromatic residues typically occurs at the 3-and 4-postions rather than at the 2-position as found in 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA. Additionally, hydroxylations in bacterial nonribosomal peptide pathways are often catalyzed by cytochrome P450 or non-heme iron/a-ketoglutarate-depen-dent enzymes;[15] biopterin-dependent hydroxylases, essential for the metabolism of aromatic amino acids and the synthesis of neurotransmitters in mammals, are relatively rare in bacte-ria.[16] On the basis of these bioinformatic evidence, we hy-pothesized that this cluster encodes biosynthetic enzymes for pepticinnamin production. We set out to test this hypothesis and to characterize the unusual tailoring enzymes.",
        "Having identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster for pepticinnamin E from A. bacterium OK006, we first examined the ability of this strain to produce pepticinnamin E. The bacte-rium was cultured in different media to elicit pepticinnamin production, and the resulting cell pellets were extracted with methanol. The extracts were then analyzed by liquid chroma-tography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis. We identified peaks with mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 908.356 and 930.345, corresponding to [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ adducts, respectively, of pepticinnamin E. In-source mass fragmentation yielded product ions with m/z of 603.223 and 547.191, which correspond to the b and y ions, respective-ly, at the 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA residue (Figures 1 A and S1). 1H NMR analysis of isolated pepticinnamin E also supports the reported structure (Figure S2 and Table S3), but we did not de-termine the stereochemistry of the isolated product. These re-sults demonstrated that A. bacterium OK006 is a new producer of pepticinnamin E.",
        "To validate the hypothesis that the pcm cluster is responsi-ble for the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E, we disrupted pcm2 by generating insertional mutants, each with a single-crossover apramycin resistance cassette. Attempts at double-crossover mutants were unsuccessful. Growth and extraction of the mutant strains under the same conditions as used for the wild-type bacterium yielded no pepticinnamin E detectable by UV",
        "absorption or MS (Figure 1 B). This result confirms that pcm is the biosynthetic gene cluster for pepticinnamin E. Pcm10 shares 58 % sequence identity with SafC, a character-ized catechol 4-O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthe-sis of saframycin MX1.[17] Therefore, we hypothesized that Pcm10 might catalyze O-methylation of l-DOPA and of deriva-tives of l-DOPA. To characterize the function of Pcm10, we cloned, expressed, and purified a His-tagged version in E. coli. The activity of Pcm10 was reconstituted in a buffered solution containing SAM and l-DOPA at 28 8C. A methylated l-DOPA product was detected by LC-HRMS, and its production was abolished in assay mixtures containing boiled Pcm10. This result indicated that Pcm10 converts l-DOPA into methylated l-DOPA. To identify the position of methylation, the methylat-ed l-DOPA product from a 10 mL overnight Pcm10 reaction was purified and subjected to 1H NMR analysis (Figure S3). The 1H shifts are consistent with those reported for 4-methyl-l-DOPA,[18] but differ from those of 3-methyl-l-DOPA.[19] This result indicated that Pcm10 methylates l-DOPA at the 4-hy-droxy position, consistent with the structure of pepticinna-min E. No methyltransfer activity was observed when Pcm10 was incubated with l-tyrosine, thus suggesting that hydroxyl-ation of l-tyrosine occurs prior to 4-methylation. To probe the substrate scope of Pcm10, we tested catechol and its derivatives, including dopamine, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acid, as substrates for Pcm10. Pcm10 did not modify catechol, but converted &50 % of dopamine and more than 70 % of caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid into their methy-",
        "Figure 1. The pcm cluster is responsible for pepticinnamin E biosynthesis.",
        "lated products during the incubation period (Scheme 3, Fig-ures S4 and S5). The activity of Pcm10 toward these substrates is comparable with that towards l-DOPA as a substrate under the same conditions. The regiochemistry of the methylated products in the cases of dopamine, caffeic acid, or chlorogenic acid was not determined. The shapes of the product peaks for these non-native substrates suggest that Pcm10 may not be regioselective toward these substrates (Figure S4). These re-sults indicate that Pcm10 is a promiscuous methyltransferase of modified catechols. SafC can also methylate catechol deriva-tives and is regioselective for l-DOPA, but not the non-native substrates.[17] These observations are explained by a recent structural study that revealed the active site of SafC to be plas-tic; it can accommodate a variety of catechol substrates, and the regioselectivity of SafC is largely substrate-dependent.[20]",
        "We conducted additional bioinformatic analyses to charac-terize the timing of hydroxylation and other tailoring reactions in the generation of 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA. The amino acid pre-cursor is likely activated by the second A domain of Pcm2 (Pcm2-A2). Pcm2-A2 shares 56 % sequence identity with the previous A domain (Pcm2-A1) that likely activates Tyr1 of pep-ticinnamin E. It also possesses a 10-residue specificity code nearly identical to that in Pcm2-A1 and another Tyr-activating A domain in the NRPS NosD,[21] suggesting that l-Tyr is the pre-ferred substrate for Pcm2-A2. Further, phylogenetic analysis of Pcm1 revealed that it groups with flavin-dependent halogenas-es SgcC3 and BhaA,[22] which prefer thiolation-domain (T)-teth-ered substrates, rather than with those that prefer free sub-strates (Figure S6). Lastly, the promiscuity of Pcm10 toward modified catechols suggests that methylation through the action of Pcm10 could occur with substrates (l-DOPA or 2-",
        "chloro-l-DOPA) loaded onto Pcm2 as T-tethered thioesters. Therefore, in the biosynthesis of 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA, l-Tyr is likely first loaded onto the second T domain of Pcm2, followed by hydroxylation through the action of Pcm11, chlorination through that of Pcm1, and O-methylation through that of Pcm10. Modification of T-domain-tethered substrates has also been reported in many NRPS biosynthetic pathways.[23] This strategy might control the flux of the amino acid precursor into natural product biosynthesis and reduce the formation of unnecessary intermediates. From our experimental results and bioinformatic analyses, we propose a pathway for pepticinnamin E biosynthesis (Scheme 4). Each module is responsible for the activation and loading of the corresponding amino acid, condensation with the downstream amino acid, and methylation of the amide NH group in the cases of the second and third amino acids. Be-sides the canonical NRPS chemistry, a few domains in the path-way may catalyze unusual chemistry. Two out of the five amino acids in pepticinnamin E\u2014Tyr1 and Ser4\u2014exhibit d ste-reochemistry. Although d-amino acids in nonribosomal pep-tides often results from the epimerase activity of condensation (C) domains, the C domains in the pcm pathway exhibit no sig-nificant similarity to those with dual epimerase/condensation functions (Figure S7). In fact, phylogenetic analysis revealed that C domains in modules 2\u20135 all group with LCL domains that catalyze amide formation between two l-configured amino acids, whereas the first C domain groups with starter domains (Figure S7). Additionally, N-Me-Phe3 and Ser4 are con-nected through an ester linkage. A standalone C domain, SgcC5, in the C-1027 gene cluster has been shown to catalyze ester bond formation between the benzoxazolinate and the enediyne core.[24] Other C domains have also been associated with nonribosomal peptide chain extension through ester bonds in the pathways for kutzneride,[25] valinomycin,[26] and cereulide.[27] Thus, the fourth C domain (C4) in Pcm30 may di-rectly catalyze ester bond formation or facilitate the rearrange-ment from an amide to an ester. However, like in the case of SgcC5, no significant changes in the conserved residues are observed in that of Pcm30-C4. The ester linkage allows the amine moiety of Ser4 to condense with Gly5, forming the C-terminal diketopiperazine. Diketopiperazine formation may be catalyzed by the terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of Pcm30. However, sequence analysis of Pcm30-TE identified the con-served GxSxG motif but did not suggest any unusual features. Further, phylogenetic analysis revealed no distinct grouping with any subtypes of TE domains (Figure S8). The functions and mechanisms of the C and TE domains in the pepticinna-min pathway remain to be characterized. In summary, we have employed a bioinformatic approach to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of pepticinnamin E and to discover a new producing bacterium for this natural prod-uct. We also identified and characterized an O-methyltransfer-ase enzyme in the biosynthesis of the rare nonproteinogenic amino acid 2-Cl-4-O-Me-l-DOPA and demonstrated that this enzyme is promiscuous toward a variety of catechol deriva-tives. Our work sets the stage for elucidating the biosynthetic chemistry of pepticinnamin E, especially the timing and mech-",

Each 100 mL reaction mixture contained Tris (pH 8.3, 50 mm), NaCl (200 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), SAM (1.6 mm), and substrate (1 mm). Re-actions were initiated by addition of Pcm (104 mL) to a final con-centration of 9.2 mm, and the mixtures were incubated for 1.5 h at 28 8C and 750 rpm and quenched by the addition of 1 volume of trichloroacetic acid (10 %) to precipitate proteins in the assay. Reac-tion mixtures were stored at @20 8C prior to LC-HRMS analysis, at which point the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifuga-tion at 21 700 g for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted 1:2 in H2O, and the diluted sample (10 mL) was analyzed with an Agilent Tech-nologies 6520 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC-HRMS. Samples were sepa-rated on a Kinetex C18 column (Phenomenex, 100 a, 5 mm, 150 mm V 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min@1 over a linear gra-dient of 5 to 95 % acetonitrile containing 0.1 % formic acid over 25 min. ESI-MS was conducted in positive ion mode with the fol-lowing parameters: gas temperature 350 8C, drying gas 12 L min@1, nebulizer 50 lb in@2, fragmentor 175 V, skimmer 65 V, capillary cap 3500 V, octopole RF 750 V. Assay mixtures containing catechol as a substrate were analyzed by ESI-MS in negative ion mode with the following parameters: gas temperature 350 8C, drying gas 5 L min@1, nebulizer 20 lb in@2, fragmentor 175 V, skimmer 65 V, ca-pillary cap 3500 V, octopole RF 750 V. Analysis of the substrate scope of Pcm10 was performed under the same conditions with the different substrates (1 mm). After 3 h in-cubation, the reaction mixtures were quenched with 1 volume of trichloroacetic acid (10 %) and stored at @20 8C. Prior to HPLC anal-ysis, samples were centrifuged at 21 000 g for 5 min to remove the protein precipitants and neutralized with NaOH solution. A sample (20 mL) was injected onto a Kinetex C18 column (Phenomenex, 100 a, 5 mm, 150 mm V 4.6 mm) and analyzed by Shimadzu analyti-cal HPLC with use of a gradient of 2.5!20 % solvent B over 10 min for l-DOPA and l-Tyr, and a gradient of 2.5!50 % solvent B over 10 min for catechol, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and dopamine (solvent A: water containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: acetonitrile containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid). Substrate con-sumption and product formation in the reaction was calculated from the integrated peak areas of UV absorbance at 280 nm at spe-cific retention times.",
