However, the enzyme was found to be predominantly in the form of inclusion bodies. This protein presents a challenging target forrefolding, both due to the size (768kDa) and quaternary structure (12\u00a364 kDa). Successful refolding conditions have been establishedwhich result in an increase in the Wnal yield of active bromoperoxidase from 0.5mg to 40mg per litre of culture. The refolded protein hasbeen characterised and compared to the native enzyme and was shown to be stable at temperatures of 80\u00b0C, over a pH range 5.5\u201310 andin organic solvents such as ethanol, acetonitrile, methanol, and acetone. The novel refolding approach reported in this paper opens up thefull potential of this versatile enzyme for use in large scale biotransformation studies.\u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, inclusion bodies can present a realadvantage once refolding conditions have been establishedas high protein yields can often be achieved and puriWca-tion can be simpler due to the removal of many of the hostE. coli proteins remaining in the soluble fraction.Biotransformation approaches have been used success-fully for the production of pharmaceuticals and their inter-mediates where traditional chemical synthesis has provedto be problematic [4]. Such approaches are also particularlyvaluable as an alternative to chemical manufacture whenconventional synthesis generates potentially harmful by-products. The production of halogenated compounds is amatter of environmental concern and the use of biohalo-genation could markedly reduce the amount of halogenpollutants produced. For example, synthetic brominationtypically yields \u00bb50% bromine incorporation, with theremaining bromine forming waste compounds. Using a bio-transformation approach employing haloperoxidases 266 E.E. Coupe et al. / Protein Expression and PuriWcation 52 (2007) 265\u2013272markedly reduce these levels in wastewater and underpinthe production of drugs such as Vancomycin, Maracen A,and cryptophycins (all halo-containing compounds), whilstreducing the environmental impact of these processes.Haloperoxidases (E.C. 1.11.1.10) are a member of theoxidoreductase sub-family, peroxidase, which catalyse thein vitro oxidation of halides by hydrogen peroxide (usuallyin the presence of haem or vanadium). They are of indus-trial and pharmaceutical interest because of their ability tohalogenate compounds such as acetogenins (anti-microbialactivity), and indoles (anti-inXammatory and anti-canceractivities) [5]. Haloperoxidases have also been shown tohalogenate Xavanones [6], terpenes [7], and various aromat-ics and alkenes [8,9]. They are able to catalyse the oxidationof organic sulWdes enantioselectively [10], as well as per-form epoxidation reactions [11], which are of signiWcantinterest from an industrial perspective. Due to their greaterstability, vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (VHPO)are of particular interest and importance.The vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase from Coral-lina oYcinalis (CoVBPO) has been studied both biochemi-cally [12] and structurally [13] from wild-type protein. TheCoVBPO is found to have a large dodecameric (12\u00a364kDa)structure formed by six identical subunits [13] showing stabil-ity over a pH range of 5\u201310 [14] and at temperatures up to90\u00b0C making it an attractive enzyme for commercial bioca-talysis. It is also active in solvents such as ethanol, methanoland propan-1-ol [12,15]. The ability to clone and express therecombinant protein is important for its commercial applica-tion and the production of suYcient mutant protein for stud-ies to help elucidate its mechanism of action.The native wild-type VBPO enzyme is expressed in lowyields in C. oYcinalis and recombinant expression of VBPO\u2019sin Saccharomyces cerevisiae or E. coli is predominantly in theform of insoluble inclusion bodies [16,17], thereby necessitat-ing refolding. The size and quaternary structure of CoVBPOmake it an ambitious target for refolding studies. Presentedhere, are the results of successful cloning, over-expressionand protein refolding experiments, which have increased theyield of the active enzyme produced from 0.5 to 40mg/L ofE. coli. The stability of the recombinant protein has beeninvestigated against a range of parameters including temper-ature, pH and diVerent solvents, particularly with respect toits potential use as an industrial biocatalyst.In this paper, we describe the isolation and characterisa-tion of three forms of CoVBPO: nVBPO which has beenisolated directly from the algal species C. oYcinalis, sVBPOproduced in a soluble form by E. coli and rVBPO which hasbeen expressed by E. coli as inclusion bodies and subse-quently refolded.Materials and methodsExtraction of genomic DNA from C. oYcinalisCorallina oYcinalis was collected from Ladram Bay inDevon, UK. One gram of C. oYcinalis fronds were crushedusing a pestle and mortar pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Thealgal material was ground to a Wne powder and added to8 mL of CTAB buVer buVer (2% (w/v) hexadecyltrimethy-lammonium bromide, 100mM Tris-Base, 10mM EDTA,700 mM NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) None-mercaptoethanol) and incu-bated (65\u00b0C, 30min) with frequent inversion of the sampletube. Eight millilitres of chloroisoamylalcohol (CIA) wereadded and the sample incubated (room temperature,15 min) with agitation. The samples were centrifuged(5 min, 8000g, 4\u00b0C) and the aqueous layer removed. TheCIA extraction was then repeated, and the DNA precipi-tated with ethanol for storage.Cloning and expression of vbpo from C. oYcinalisPrimers for the PCR ampliWcation of the vbpo weredesigned based on the published Corallina pilulifera sequence[16], which showed high homology to the C. oYcinalis aminoacid sequence deduced by X-ray crystallography [13]. Thecoding sequence was ampliWed by PCR with oligonucleotidesVBPOF1 5None-CGT CAT GCT CAT GTG GCC-3None and thereverse primer VBPOR1 5None-GTC CAG TTA AAA TTAGAT GTG G-3None using genomic C. oYcinalis DNA as a tem-plate. The fragment was cloned into pGem-T Easy(Promega) and transformed into E. coli JM109. Positive col-onies were selected by blue/white selection on LB/Amp(100Noneg/mL) plates and 10mL overnight cultures grown. Thevbpo containing plasmid was extracted and fragment identiW-cation conWrmed by DNA sequencing. Restriction sites wereadded by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers VBPOF25None-GCG CAT ATG GGT ATT CCA GCT GAC AAC CTCCAA AG-3None and the reverse primer VBPOR2 5None-CCA GCGGCC GCT TAG ATC TGG ATT GTA GTT CCA TC-3None(restriction sites are underlined). The fragment was clonedinto pGem-T Easy (Promega) and transformed into E. coliJM109. Positive colonies were again selected by blue/whiteselection on LB/Amp (100Noneg/mL) plates and 10mL over-night cultures grown. The plasmid was extracted anddigested overnight with NdeI/NotI at 37\u00b0C. The vbpo frag-ment was gel extracted and cloned into the NdeI and NotIrestriction sites of pET22b, and a pET28a expression vector(Stratagene), which had been modiWed to be ampicillin resis-tant. The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)(Invitrogen) and positive colonies selected by ampicillin resis-tance (100Noneg/mL) on LB agar plates.Induction studiesA starter culture (20mL) was grown overnight and usedto inoculate 100mL of LB culture medium aliquoted into500 mL Erlenmeyer Xasks and agitated at 240rpm (InforsMultitron shaker). Ampicillin (50Noneg/mL) was added pre-inoculation. Protein expression was induced at either OD6000.5 or 1 with 0.5mM or 1M IPTG. The cultures were incu-bated at 19\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C and the cells harvested bycentrifugation (8000g, 4\u00b0C, 20min) for analysis of proteinexpression by E.E. Coupe et al. / Protein Expression and PuriWcation 52 (2007) 265\u2013272267 Expression of VBPOA starter culture (20mL) was grown overnight at 37\u00b0C and used to inoculate 1L cultures of LB medium dis-pensed into 2L Erlenmeyer Xasks agitated at 190rpm (Infors Multitron shaker). Ampicillin (50Noneg/mL) wasadded pre-inoculation. Protein expression was inducedwith 0.5mM IPTG when the OD600 had reached 1 and thecultures were incubated for a further three hours at 37\u00b0C prior to harvesting by centrifugation using conditionsshown above.PuriWcation of native VBPO (nVBPO)The nVBPO was puriWed from the algal source using anadaptation of the published method [12]. A 250g sampleof C. oYcinalis was ground to a powder under liquidnitrogen using a pre-cooled pestle and mortar. The result-ing Wne powder was suspended in BuVer 1 (50mM Tris\u2013H2SO4, pH 8.3) and Wltered through a double layer ofMiracloth\u2122 (Calbiochem). The Wltrate was centrifuged(30 min, 8000g, 4\u00b0C) and ammonium sulfate fractionationwas performed at 30% (w/v) and 60% (w/v) saturation.Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at8000g. The pellet from the 60% precipitation was resus-pended in the minimum volume of BuVer 1 and dialysedovernight against 1000\u00a3 volume of the same buVer. Thesample was then applied to a DEAE Sephadex column(Pharmacia) in BuVer 1 and the protein eluted using a lin-ear gradient to BuVer 1 containing 500mM KBr. Activefractions were pooled and concentrated by 70% (w/v)ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pellet was resus-pended in BuVer 1 and dialysed against 1000\u00a3 volume ofthe same buVer. The lysate was loaded onto a MonoQ col-umn (Pharmacia) in BuVer 1 and the nVBPO eluted usinga linear gradient to BuVer 1 containing 1M KBr. Theactive fractions were pooled and the purity analysed bySDS\u2013PAGE [18]. The puriWed nVBPO was stored at 4\u00b0C in BuVer 1.Quantitative assessment of VBPO activity and protein concentration Protein concentrations were determined using a standardapproach [19]. Bromoperoxidase activity was assessed bymonitoring the bromination of monochlorodimedone(MCD) spectrophotometrically at 290nm. The assay wascarried out at 25\u00b0C in 50mM MES, pH 6.50, containing200 mM KBr and 0.1mM MCD (MCD assay buVer). Thereaction was initiated by the addition of 1mM H2O2 and thedecrease in MCD absorption over 1min was recorded.VBPO was incubated with 1mM Na3VO4 overnight prior toactivity assays. Twenty microliters of 0.1mg/mL VBPO wasused in the assay unless otherwise stated. Activity resultswere expressed in enzyme units (U), representing the initialvelocity of the reaction in terms of Nonemol of substrate con-verted per minute.PuriWcation of soluble recombinant VBPO (sVBPO)The VBPO expressed in a soluble form in E. coli waspuriWed for comparative studies. The E. coli pellet was son-icated (3s bursts, 50A, 6min) in BuVer 1 and centrifuged(4 \u00b0C, 30min, 8000g). Ammonium sulfate fractionation wasperformed at 30% (w/v), centrifuged and the pellet dis-carded. The supernatant was brought to 60% saturationand precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation(8000g) and puriWed as previously described for thenVBPO. The puriWed sVBPO was stored at 4\u00b0C. Preparation of VBPO inclusion bodiesThe VBPO expressed in an insoluble form in E. coli(without a 6His-tag) was extracted as inclusion bodies anddenatured for use in refolding studies. The E. coli pellet wassuspended in 4mL/g BuVer 2 (100mM Tris\u2013H2SO4, pH 8.0,500 mM NaCl, 5mM None-mercaptoethanol, 5mM EDTA,200 Noneg/mL lysozyme, 0.1NoneL/mL benzonase) and sonicated.The sonicate was centrifuged (8000g, 30min, 4\u00b0C), thesupernatant discarded and the resulting pellet suspended in4\u20136 mL of BuVer 3 (100mM Tris\u2013H2SO4, pH 8.0, 5mM None-mercaptoethanol, 1M urea, 1% Triton X-100). Centrifuga-tion was carried out as before and the wash repeated. Thepellet was suspended in 4mL/g of BuVer 4 (100mM Tris\u2013H2SO4, pH 8.0, 5mM None-mercaptoethanol) and again pel-leted by centrifugation. The inclusion body preparationwas solubilised in the minimum volume of BuVer 5(100 mM Tris\u2013H2SO4, pH 8.0, 8.0M urea) and stirred atroom temperature for 30min. The remaining cell debris wasremoved by centrifugation (100,000g, 1h, 4\u00b0C) and thesupernatant Wltered (0.2Nonem) and used for refolding studies.Typical yields were in the region of 65mg/L culture.Refolding of VBPO by aYnity chromatographyThe His-tagged VBPO enzyme expressed as inclusionbodies (approximately 60mg/mL) was solubilised in BuVerA (0.2M Tris\u2013H2SO4, pH 8.3, 0.5M NaCl) with either 8M urea or 6M guanidine hydrochloride to 10mg/mL Wnalconcentration. 5mL total volume was loaded on to a NickelaYnity column (Sigma). The column was then washed with1 column volume BuVer B (0.2M Tris\u2013H2SO4, pH 8.3,0.5 M NaCl, 1mM None-mercaptoethanol, 30mM imidazole)with the corresponding denaturant. Two diVerent protocolswere then used:Method 1 (gradient): The concentration of the denatur-ant was decreased over 5 column volumes and the pro-tein eluted with 500mM imidazole.Method 2 (stepwise): The concentration of the denatur-ant was decreased by 1M every 0.5 column volumes.Protein was eluted with 500mM imidazole.Protein eluted by imidazole was concentrated by ammo-nium sulfate precipitation (80% (w/v)) and dialysed 268 E.E. Coupe et al. / Protein Expression and PuriWcation 52 (2007) 265\u2013272BuVer A overnight prior to centrifugation (8000g, 20min) to remove any aggregates. Activity assays and protein esti-mations were carried out as previously described.Refolding of VBPO by dialysisThe VBPO inclusion bodies from a 1L culture (approxi-mately 60mg) were solubilised in 10mL BuVer A with 8M urea and dialysed following three diVerent protocols.Method 3 (rapid): The denatured VBPO was dialysedagainst 500\u00a3 volumes of BuVer A at 4\u00b0C for 24h. ThebuVer was replaced after 12h. The sample was centri-fuged (8000g, 30min) and the supernatant assayed forprotein concentration and haloperoxidase activity.Method 4 (gradual): The denatured protein was dialysedagainst 500\u00a3 volumes of BuVer A with 6M urea at 4\u00b0C for 12h. The buVer was then replaced with 500\u00a3 vol-umes of BuVer A with 4M urea, 2M urea and no urea at12 h intervals. The sample was centrifuged and assayedas for Method 3.Method 5 (rapid bulk): A 10mL sample was injected into5 L of a rapidly stirring BuVer A. Ammonium sulfateprecipitation (80%) was then carried out to concentratethe sample and the resulting pellet resuspended in 10mL BuVer A, prior to overnight dialysis against BuVer A toremove salt from the sample. Assays were carried out aswith Method 3.Refolding of VBPO (rVBPO)One liter of refolding buVer (500mM urea, 250mM NDSB-201, 55mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 pH 7.5, 1mM Na3VO4, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM GSH, 0.1mM GSSG,100 mM NaCl, and 100mM KCl) was cooled to 4\u00b0C. A10 mL sample of the inclusion body preparation was gener-ated using BuVer 5 (100mM Tris\u2013H2SO4, pH 8.0, 8M urea).The sample was pumped (100NoneL/min) into the refoldingbuVer, which was rapidly stirred (4\u00b0C). After refolding theprotein was concentrated to 2mL (10kDa Amicon Wlter)and dialysed overnight into BuVer 1. The sample wasapplied to a MonoQ column (Pharmacia) in BuVer 1 andeluted using a linear gradient to BuVer 1 containing 1M KBr. Active fractions were pooled and analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE. The refolded VBPO (rVBPO) was stored (4\u00b0C) foruse in characterisation studies. With the exception ofrVBPO used in temperature stability studies, the samplewas incubated for 20min at 50\u00b0C prior to anion exchangechromatography. This step was not required for sVBPO ornVBPO. Initial characterisation of three preparations of VBPOIn all cases, the maximum activity of VBPO at diVerenttemperatures was investigated by carrying out the stan-dard assay following bromination of Monochlorodime-done (MCD) at 20\u201370\u00b0C in 5\u00b0C increments. 20NoneL of theenzyme was added to the assay buVer and equilibrated atthe appropriate temperature for 5min prior to the addi-tion of H2O2. In order to assess the temperature stabilityof the three enzyme preparations, incubations were per-formed for 20, 40 or 60min at 20\u201390\u00b0C in 10\u00b0C incre-ments. The enzymes were allowed to equilibrate to roomtemperature prior to the activity assay being performed.Samples that had been incubated at 80\u00b0C were alsoassayed after the addition of 1mM NaVO4. The NaVO4was added after cooling and samples incubated for30 min. For the investigation of pH stability, 20NoneL ofeach preparation were incubated overnight in 80NoneL ofbuVer in a pH range of 5.5\u201310 prior to equilibration in980 NoneL MCD assay buVer for 1h. The buVers (50mM Wnalconcentration) used were MES (pH 5.5\u20137.0), Tris\u2013H2SO4(pH 7.0\u20139.0) and CHES (pH 8.5\u201310.0). The assay was initi-ated by the addition of H2O2. The pH optima of theenzymes were assessed by carrying out the MCD assay ina range of buVers from pH 5.5\u201310.0. The buVers were thesame as those used for pH stability but with the additionof 200mM KBr and 0.1mM MCD. The assay was carriedout as described previously. For solvent stability evalua-tion, the three enzymes preparations were incubated over-night in 20, 40, 60 or 80% (v/v) solvent prior to assay.Solvents investigated were ethanol, acetonitrile, methanol,and acetone.Circular dichroism analysis of VBPOThe secondary structure of nVBPO and rVBPO werecompared using CD spectroscopy, Samples were puriWed aspreviously described and dialysed into 15mM Tris\u2013H2SO4buVer (pH 8) overnight and concentrated to 0.2mg/mL. CD experiments were performed on a Jasco J-810 spec-tropolarimeter at 20\u00b0C in a cell of pathlength 0.02cm andwere corrected by use of a buVer blank. The scan speed was50 nm/min, the response time 0.5s. In each case, 8 scanswere accumulated, averaged and smoothed using Jascosoftware. Spectra were converted to molar ellipticity unitsusing a value of 108 for the mean residue weight of the pro-tein. Results Nucleotide and protein sequence of vbpo from C. oYcinalisSequencing information showed that vbpo was presentas a continuous gene with no introns. Two vbpo genes werefound in C. oYcinalis (CoVBPO1 and CoVBPO2), bothshowing over 90% identity to the predicted amino acidsequence based on crystallographic studies [13] and N-ter-minal and peptide sequencing.Sequences were aligned using ClustalW [20] andsequence identities to other haloperoxidases isolated fromCorallina species were greater than 90%. Indeed, CoVBPO1was 91% identical to the predicted amino acid compositionfrom the crystal structure [13] and CoVBPO2 showed E.E. Coupe et al. / Protein Expression and PuriWcation 52 (2007) 265\u2013272269 identity. The similarity between CoVBPO1 and CoVBPO2was 90% with the main diVerences being in the amino acidsforming helices 14\u201316, as had been previously reported forVBPO isolated from C. pilulifera [16] to which CoVBPOshowed over 90% homology. VBPO2 from C. oYcinalis wassubsequently used in all expression and characterisationstudies. Expression of VBPO in E. coliAnalysis by SDS\u2013PAGE gels showed \u00bb90% of VBPOwas expressed as inclusion bodies. DiVerent expressionconditions were evaluated by varying time of induction,post-induction temperature and the concentration ofIPTG. However, none of the conditions used showed anysigniWcant improvement in soluble protein expression(data not shown). In all cases, the analysis of the insolublefraction by SDS\u2013PAGE showed a signiWcant protein bandat approximately 65kDa. The identity of this bandwas conWrmed to be VBPO by MALDI-TOF mass spec-trometry. Refolding and puriWcation of rVBPOAYnity column refolding, both stepwise and by gradi-ent removal of denaturant, resulted in a maximum yieldof 12mg of active rVBPO from 72mg denatured VBPO(16% recovery). Refolding by gradual dialysis resulted ina yield of 8mg of active rVBPO from 68mg denaturedVBPO (12% recovery) and refolding by rapid dialysis andrapid bulk dialysis a 15% recovery. After puriWcation, thebatch refolding method resulted in a 40mg yield of activerVBPO from 68mg of denatured VBPO representing a59% recovery.PuriWcation of nVBPO and sVBPOThe protein was puriWed as shown (see Materials andmethods) resulting in near homogeneity as demonstratedby SDS\u2013PAGE (results not shown). Typical yields were8 mg nVBPO from 1kg wet weight of C. oYcinalis and0.5 mg of recombinant sVBPO isolated from a 1L micro-bial culture.AVect of temperature on VBPOThe VBPO protein was active up to 70\u00b0C, which wasthe upper limit of the spectrophotometer used, for bothrVBPO and nVBPO samples. The increase was linear inthe region of 450U/mg (20\u00b0C) to 5000U/mg (70\u00b0C). ForsVBPO, the maximum activity (5000U/mg) was at 65\u00b0C, with 60% of the maximum activity being lost at 70\u00b0C (data not shown).The results from a 1h heat treatment experiment areshown below (Fig.1). Approximately 50% of the activitywas retained up to 60\u00b0C. All three samples retained oneWfth of the initial activity after incubation at 70\u00b0C for 1h. The only signiWcant anomaly was an increase in activityafter incubation at 50\u00b0C for sample rVBPO, where itsactivity is 50% higher than sVBPO and nVBPO, althoughthe sample showed a similar proWle at higher temperatures.In all cases, incubation of the 80\u00b0C heat-treated enzymewith 1mM Na3VO4 resulted in 95% of maximum activitybeing regained.Variation of activity of VBPO with pHThe pH optimum for rVBPO and nVBPO was pH 7.0,with sVBPO activity being slightly higher at pH 7.5(Fig. 2). In all cases, the activity was in the region of550 U/mg. All enzymes remained active over the pH range5.5\u201310.0. Solvent stability of VBPOThe aVect of a range of solvents upon all three enzymepreparations was investigated. In all cases, VBPO activitywas observed in the presence of 80% (v/v) solvent. sVBPOshowed an increase in activity in the presence of acetonitrile,which was not observed with nVBPO or rVBPO (Fig.3).

Discussion Sequencing of vbpoThe presence of two isoforms of vbpo within C. oYcinaliswas not unexpected. This observation has also been madein two other algal species, the red seaweed C. pilulifera [16]and the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum [21,22]. Thetwo isoforms observed in A. nodosum were shown to havediVerent cellular locations [23], one inside the thallus andthe second on the thallus surface. In C. pilulifera thesequence variations occur mainly in the amino acids thatmake up helices 14\u201316, as is the case with the closely relatedC. oYcinalis. VBPO2 from C. oYcinalis was chosen for usein all studies due to the slightly higher identity to the pre-dicted amino acid sequence from the crystal structure [13].Expression of VBPOAs previously reported, expression of VBPO in the solubleform was shown to be minimal [16] with yields of 0.3mg/L ofthe recombinant protein obtained from both E. coli and S.cerevisae. Changes in vector/host combination showed noimprovement on the soluble protein yield previously reportedin the literature [24]. Attempts to improve the soluble proteinexpression by evaluating diVerent induction regimes changingpost-induction temperature, induction concentration and timeof induction did not signiWcantly improve the amount of solu-ble protein obtained. The poor yield of sVBPO was insuYcientto support industrial scale biotransformation reactions. Basedon these observations, a standard induction protocol was fol-lowed and the insoluble protein was refolded in order to maxi-mise the yield of available enzyme.Refolding of VBPORefolding of the VBPO while bound to an aYnity col-umn supported the production of active VBPO but onlyFig. 4.

Coupe et al. / Protein Expression and PuriWcation 52 (2007) 265\u2013272271 resulted in a 16% recovery. This may have been due to thefact that the N-terminal helix of the protein is found fromthe crystal structure to pack into a central cavity and maynot be possible with the His-tag present at the N-terminalof the recombinant protein. It may also be possible that theinteractions necessary for dimer formation and stabilisa-tion were not possible while the sample remained bound tothe column. Cleavage of the His-tag to elute the proteinfrom the aYnity column was attempted but no increase inthe yield of active protein was observed. Consequently, theN-terminally His-tagged protein was not used for subse-quent refolding studies. Refolding by gradual and rapiddialysis of the untagged form of the protein resulted in theformation of precipitate, indicative of mis-folded protein,although a small percentage of VBPO did show someactivity. Subsequently, the addition of diVerent buVering systemsand additives was used in an attempt to assist in the proteinrefolding process. Initial results showed active rVBPO wasproduced in buVers containing both Tris and phosphate. Itis known that phosphate will bind to the apoenzyme inplace of vanadate at the active site [25] which may help therefolding process. An excess of phosphate is known toinhibit VBPO activity [26] and it was assumed that thephosphate could be exchanged for vanadate during therefolding process. However, when phosphate was omittedfrom the refolding process and when it was substituted forthe native vanadate there was an increase in protein precip-itation and the subsequent yield of active rVBPO decreased.The crystal structure also shows the presence of a boundMg2+ ion in the VBPO protein so MgCl2 was also added inan attempt to aid refolding and its addition did decreaseprecipitation. The Wnal refolding buVer (500mM Urea,250 mM NDSB-201, 55mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.5,1 mM Na3VO4, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM GSH, 0.1mM GSSG,100 mM NaCl, and 100mM KCl) supported an 80-foldincrease (from 0.5 to 40mg/L) in yield compared to the sol-uble protein produced by the same construct.Stability of rVBPO compared to s/nVBPODuring characterisation studies, it was observed thatsVBPO behaved diVerently to nVBPO. Studies into VBPOactivity at diVerent temperatures showed that sVBPO had alower temperature optimum, suggesting that the thermosta-bility of sVBPO was reduced and that the enzyme in someway varied from the nVBPO. This diVerence is also high-lighted by the aVect of pH and the behaviour of the sVBPOin the presence of solvents. This observation suggests thatalthough a soluble, active conformation has been achievedby sVBPO, there may be slight diVerences between thenVBPO and sVBPO structures. The only signiWcant diVer-ence between rVBPO and nVBPO was the increase in activ-ity observed with rVBPO after incubation at 50\u00b0C. Thissuggests that some minor adjustments to the tertiary/qua-ternary structure were taking place during this heat stepwhich was subsequently included in the puriWcation proce-dure of the rVBPO. No signiWcant diVerences were seenbetween the rVBPO and nVBPO enzymes indicating thatthere was a close relationship between these structures aswas also conWrmed by the circular dichroism studies.In summary, a novel, high yielding refolding method hasbeen developed resulting in an 80-fold increase in the yieldof rVBPO compared to previously reported methods. Thisnew approach, supporting the production of large amountsof the recombinant bromoperoxidase enzyme, removes amajor bottleneck in the application of this versatile enzymefor use in industrial scale biotransformation reactions. Theproduction of suYcient amount of mutant enzyme willallow both biochemical and structural analysis of theseproteins to help understand the catalytic mechanism of thisdodecameric vanadium-dependant enzyme.Acknowledgments This work was funded by the Biotechnology and Biolog-ical Sciences Research Council, UK and GlaxoSmithKlineas part of a CASE studentship to Elizabeth Coupe.

        "The dodecameric vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase from Corallina oYcinalis has been cloned and over-expressed in Escherichiacoli. However, the enzyme was found to be predominantly in the form of inclusion bodies. This protein presents a challenging target forrefolding, both due to the size (768kDa) and quaternary structure (12\u00a364 kDa). Successful refolding conditions have been establishedwhich result in an increase in the Wnal yield of active bromoperoxidase from 0.5mg to 40mg per litre of culture. The refolded protein hasbeen characterised and compared to the native enzyme and was shown to be stable at temperatures of 80\u00b0C, over a pH range 5.5\u201310 andin organic solvents such as ethanol, acetonitrile, methanol, and acetone. The novel refolding approach reported in this paper opens up thefull potential of this versatile enzyme for use in large scale biotransformation studies.\u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights",

Many host strain and vec-tor combinations have been developed and, under optimalconditions, up to 50% of the protein produced can be thedesired product. However, in many cases heterologousexpression of foreign proteins in E. coli results in the pro-duction of insoluble inclusion bodies as a result of proteinmis-folding. In situations where invivo techniques fail toimprove soluble expression, appropriate refolding condi-tions must be found, often by trial and error. Over the yearsthere have been many notable successes in protein refoldingas reviewed [1] and the Weld is expanding with more investi-gations being made into the eVects of additives, such as thezwitterionic detergents NDSB (non-detergent sulfobeta-ines) and redox agents such as GSH/GSSG1 (reduced",

They are of indus-trial and pharmaceutical interest because of their ability tohalogenate compounds such as acetogenins (anti-microbialactivity), and indoles (anti-inXammatory and anti-canceractivities) [5]. Haloperoxidases have also been shown tohalogenate Xavanones [6], terpenes [7], and various aromat-ics and alkenes [8,9]. They are able to catalyse the oxidationof organic sulWdes enantioselectively [10], as well as per-form epoxidation reactions [11], which are of signiWcantinterest from an industrial perspective. Due to their greaterstability, vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (VHPO)are of particular interest and importance.The vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase from Coral-lina oYcinalis (CoVBPO) has been studied both biochemi-cally [12] and structurally [13] from wild-type protein. TheCoVBPO is found to have a large dodecameric (12\u00a364kDa)structure formed by six identical subunits [13] showing stabil-ity over a pH range of 5\u201310 [14] and at temperatures up to90\u00b0C making it an attractive enzyme for commercial bioca-talysis. It is also active in solvents such as ethanol, methanoland propan-1-ol [12,15]. The ability to clone and express therecombinant protein is important for its commercial applica-tion and the production of suYcient mutant protein for stud-ies to help elucidate its mechanism of action.The native wild-type VBPO enzyme is expressed in lowyields in C. oYcinalis and recombinant expression of VBPO\u2019sin Saccharomyces cerevisiae or E. coli is predominantly in theform of insoluble inclusion bodies [16,17], thereby necessitat-ing refolding. The size and quaternary structure of CoVBPOmake it an ambitious target for refolding studies. Presentedhere, are the results of successful cloning, over-expressionand protein refolding experiments, which have increased theyield of the active enzyme produced from 0.5 to 40mg/L ofE. coli. The stability of the recombinant protein has beeninvestigated against a range of parameters including temper-ature, pH and diVerent solvents, particularly with respect toits potential use as an industrial biocatalyst.In this paper, we describe the isolation and characterisa-tion of three forms of CoVBPO: nVBPO which has beenisolated directly from the algal species C. oYcinalis, sVBPOproduced in a soluble form by E. coli and rVBPO which hasbeen expressed by E. coli as inclusion bodies and subse-quently",

Thetwo isoforms observed in A. nodosum were shown to havediVerent cellular locations [23], one inside the thallus andthe second on the thallus surface. In C. pilulifera thesequence variations occur mainly in the amino acids thatmake up helices 14\u201316, as is the case with the closely relatedC. oYcinalis.

This may have been due to thefact that the N-terminal helix of the protein is found fromthe crystal structure to pack into a central cavity and maynot be possible with the His-tag present at the N-terminalof the recombinant protein. It may also be possible that theinteractions necessary for dimer formation and stabilisa-tion were not possible while the sample remained bound tothe column. Cleavage of the His-tag to elute the proteinfrom the aYnity column was attempted but no increase inthe yield of active protein was observed. Consequently, theN-terminally His-tagged protein was not used for subse-quent refolding studies.

Initial results showed active rVBPO wasproduced in buVers containing both Tris and phosphate. Itis known that phosphate will bind to the apoenzyme inplace of vanadate at the active site [25] which may help therefolding process. An excess of phosphate is known toinhibit VBPO activity [26] and it was assumed that thephosphate could be exchanged for vanadate during therefolding process. However, when phosphate was omittedfrom the refolding process and when it was substituted forthe native vanadate there was an increase in protein precip-itation and the subsequent yield of active rVBPO decreased.The crystal structure also shows the presence of a boundMg2+ ion in the VBPO protein so MgCl2 was also added inan attempt to aid refolding and its addition did decreaseprecipitation.

This diVerence is also high-lighted by the aVect of pH and the behaviour of the sVBPOin the presence of solvents. This observation suggests thatalthough a soluble, active conformation has been achievedby sVBPO, there may be slight diVerences between thenVBPO and sVBPO structures. The only signiWcant diVer-ence between rVBPO and nVBPO was the increase in activ-ity observed with rVBPO after incubation at 50\u00b0C.
