In this regard, both synthetic and cellular chemistry provide access to an extremely broad range of compounds, but the struc-tural space occupied by molecules made by humans as compared to those made by nature are often orthogonal. While living systems use the unparalleled selectivity of enzymes to construct molecules with a limited set of functional groups, synthetic methods instead utilize an extensive range of strategies for bond formation. As such, the development of approaches to bridge synthetic and cellular chemis-try can help us to gain access to new structures and classes of com-pounds by combining the exquisite selectivity of enzymes with the breadth of functional groups used for synthetic transformations1\u20133. The introduction of halogens (X = F, Cl, Br, I) into a functional group-dense scaffold is especially useful, serving both to tune bio-activity4,5 and to act as a reactive handle for the formation of new chemical bonds for diversification and modification of late-stage synthetic intermediates6,7. While the role of halogens in biosynthetic transformations is still being elucidated8\u201311, their value in a variety of synthetic transformations and the design of synthetic routes is well accepted12. As a result, both synthetic and enzymatic approaches to the formation of carbon\u2013halogen bonds are currently areas of major interest6\u20138,13\u201315. The selective modification of unactivated sp3 C\u2013H bonds is par-ticularly difficult, as it is challenging to identify catalysts that are sufficiently powerful to activate these bonds while maintaining regio-and stereoselectivity16. Remarkably, nature has evolved a set of non-heme FeII/\u03b1-ketoglutarate (FeII/\u03b1KG)-dependent halogenase enzymes that can achieve this task, using a high-valent metal\u2013oxo intermediate to generate a substrate radical that can rebound with the bound halide ligand17\u201319. However, only a handful of these radi-cal halogenases have been characterized and are notable for their complex substrates13. The SyrB2 family has been found to main-tain a strict requirement for carrier-protein-tethered substrates20, whereas the WelO5 family halogenates late-stage indole alkaloid natural products21. As these types of intermediates are not readily modified using downstream enzymatic pathways, the discovery of new enzymes that act on simple and modular building blocks would greatly expand the biosynthetic potential of radical halogenation. We recently discovered a radical halogenase, BesD, that chlorinates the free amino acid lysine, making it the first of the \u03b1KG-dependent radical halogenases reported to chlorinate an amino acid without the requirement for a carrier protein9.In this work, we solved the crystal structure of BesD in com-plex with its substrate lysine to better understand the basis for direct halogenation of amino acids. We have also identified additional members of this new family of radical halogenases that chlorinate different polar and non-polar amino acids with varied regioselec-tivity by investigating the unexplored sequence space around the FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenase, BesD. Additional active site muta-genesis and bioinformatic analysis provide further insight into the reaction mechanism of these enzymes and how they catalyze selec-tive chlorination. Taking advantage of the central role of amino acid building blocks in the cellular production of metabolites, natural products and macromolecules22\u201324, we demonstrate that the halo-genated amino acid products can be further converted enzymati-cally to a range of compound classes such as nitrogen heterocycles, amines, keto acids and peptides. Taken together, this work greatly expands the utility of radical halogenases and highlights the prom-ise of the BesD halogenase family in the biological production of diverse halogenated compounds.Results Structural characterization of BesD. The FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases are part of the large and highly diverse cupin super-family, which contains members that catalyze a host of different reactions, including hydroxylation, halogenation, olefin epoxida-tion and stereoinversion on a broad range of substrates25. As such, the prediction and discovery of new activities using bioinformatic approaches has been limited by the sequence variability of family A family of radical halogenases for the engineering of amino-acid-based productsMonica E.

Chang\u200a\u200a1,2,4,5* The integration of synthetic and biological catalysis enables new approaches to the synthesis of small molecules by combining the high selectivity of enzymes with the reaction diversity offered by synthetic chemistry. While organohalogens are valued for their bioactivity and utility as synthetic building blocks, only a handful of enzymes that carry out the regioselective halogena-tion of unactivated Csp3NoneHI bonds have previously been identified. In this context, we report the structural characterization of BesD, a recently discovered radical halogenase from the FeII/\u03b1-ketogluturate-dependent family that chlorinates the free amino acid lysine. We also identify and characterize additional halogenases that produce mono-and dichlorinated, as well as bromi-nated and azidated, amino acids. The substrate selectivity of this new family of radical halogenases takes advantage of the cen-tral role of amino acids in metabolism and enables engineering of biosynthetic pathways to afford a wide variety of compound classes, including heterocycles, diamines, \u03b1-keto acids and peptides.NAtuRE CHEMiCAL BioLoGY | VOL 15 | OCTOBER 2019 | 1009\u20131016 | www.nature.com/naturechemicalbiology1009 Articles NaTure ChemICal BIologymembers. In this case, BesD has very low identity to the carrier-protein-dependent halogenase SyrB2 (7% identity) and the indole alkaloid halogenase WelO5 (11% identity), and thus displays higher sequence similarity to predicted but uncharacterized FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent hydroxylases (\u226446% identity) than to other known halogenases (Supplementary Fig. 1). A query of the superfamily database revealed that BesD groups in a different protein family within the cupin superfamily as compared to previously reported FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases26.To gain a better mechanistic understanding of BesD, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of BesD with lysine, Fe, chlorine and \u03b1KG bound in the active site (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). BesD was crystallized anaerobically with lysine and \u03b1KG, and soaked with FeII. The X-ray structure was solved at a resolution of 1.95 \u00c5 by Fe-SAD phasing. The structure contains four BesD mono-mers in the asymmetric unit, all of which possess the \u03b2-sandwich topology that is characteristic of Fe/\u03b1KG enzymes18. Each monomer contains a single Fe coordinated by His137, His204, chloride and \u03b1KG in a distorted square pyramidal geometry in the active site, which contains the HXG/A motif that is characteristic of haloge-nases. The binding site for lysine in BesD is largely polar, with a network of hydrogen bonds for binding to the carboxylate (Arg74, His134 and Trp238), \u03b1-amine (Asp140) and \u03b5-amine (Glu120, Asn219 and Thr221) of the substrate (Fig. 1c,d). In addition, Trp239 on the C terminus of the protein stacks over the aliphatic side chain of lysine, closing over the substrate at the entrance of the active site. The structure also revealed a water network between Thr221 and the chloride ligand.The crystal structure highlighted differences in substrate bind-ing between BesD and the carrier-protein-dependent amino acid halogenases. In BesD, the positioning of the lysine substrate appears to be strongly determined by a two-point interaction between the free carboxylate of lysine and the guanidinium group of an active site arginine (Arg74). By contrast, in SyrB2, the carboxylate of the threonine substrate is ligated to a phosphopantetheine (Ppant) arm, which both tethers threonine to the carrier protein (SyrB1) through a thioester linkage and masks the carboxylate. It has been proposed that the Thr\u2013Ppant arm enters the active site through a tunnel and that interactions with threonine and the Ppant arm, as well as SyrB1, are likely important for positioning the substrate in the active site for catalysis27,28. Another notable difference is that BesD appears to have a covering lid that holds lysine in the active site for cataly-sis. This substrate-binding mode is more reminiscent of the indole alkaloid halogenase, WelO5, in which the substrate is held into place by a helix that closes over the active site19.Catalytic selectivity in BesD. Understanding how radical haloge-nases catalyze halogenation selectively over the closely related hydroxylation reaction remains an active area of investigation. FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenases are closely related both evolutionarily and mechanistically to the larger and more well-studied class of FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent hydroxylases29,30.

For hydroxylases, rebound of the substrate radical with the resulting hydroxo group is the only possible pathway, as the coordination site occupied by a halide in halogenases is filled by the Asp or Glu ligand from the HXD/E motif. In halogenases, however, rebound with either the halogen or the hydroxyl radical is possible, leading to potential reaction partitioning between haloge-nation and hydroxylation, respectively32 (Supplementary Fig. 2). In the case of BesD, substitution of the active site glycine of the HXG motif to an aspartate eliminates halogenation activity and results in only hydroxylation9. Indeed, it has been shown that halogenases can carry out a low level of off-pathway hydroxylation, especially when challenged with non-native substrates33. Efforts to engineer halogenases from hydroxylases have also been difficult, suggesting that second-sphere interactions are important in controlling reac-tion partitioning34.Combining insights from our structure with previous studies of FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent enzymes17, we can propose a mechanism for halogenation by BesD. Halogenases must orient the FeIV\u2013oxo inter-mediate such that it is suitably positioned to perform hydrogen atom abstraction while disfavoring rebound of the resulting FeIII\u2013OH intermediate in favor of FeIII\u2013Cl rebound. Our structure captured under anaerobic conditions most likely represents a snapshot of the active site before oxygen binding. By analogy to other FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent enzymes in the literature18,19, the putative vacant site for oxygen binding appears to be trans to His137, on the opposite side of the His204\u2013Cl\u2013\u03b1KG plane from the substrate carbon that is tar-geted for hydrogen atom abstraction (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3). If the oxo moiety remains trans to His137 upon formation of the FeIV\u2013oxo intermediate, and if the substrate position does not change, the distance between the oxo moiety and site of hydrogen atom abstraction (C4 of lysine) would be ~5.0 \u00c5 on the basis of the FeII\u2013C4(lysine) distance (4.8 \u00c5) and the estimated FeIV\u2013oxo bond length (1.6 \u00c5)31. While the precise structures of the reaction inter-mediates are unknown, this distance is longer than that calculated from density-functional theory studies on SyrB2 (ref. 31). It is also possible that conformational change of the substrate or a shift19,35 of the oxo ligand toward the position trans to His204 before, during or after decarboxylation of \u03b1KG may be needed to facilitate hydrogen Cl H204 H137 T221 N219 H204 H137 Y195 R215 3.8 \u00c5\u03b1KG Lysine 4.0 \u00c5a c b + O2Succinate, -OH\u03b1KG, H2OCl OOC O O O FeII His137 H2O ClHis204 Asn219 \u2013H2O R3C Cl + R3CH R3C H \u2013CO2 CO2 OOC O O O FeII His137 Cl His204 Asn219 OOC O O O FeIII His137 O Cl His204 Asn219 O R3C H OOC O O FeII His137 O Cl His204 R3C HOOC O O FeIV His137 O Cl His204 R3C HOOC O O FeIII His137 HO Cl His204 R3C \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013 \u2013 Fig. 2 | Proposed mechanism of halogenation by BesD. a, The ligand complex displays a vacant site for oxygen binding that is distal to the substrate.

The Fe is coordinated by His137, His204, chloride and \u03b1KG in a distorted square pyramidal geometry (gray box). On the basis of the crystal structure in this study, the putative vacant site for oxygen binding appears to be trans to His137, on the opposite side of the His204\u2013Cl\u2013\u03b1KG plane from the substrate carbon that is targeted for hydrogen atom abstraction. In this class of enzymes, binding of the substrate followed by oxygen leads to decarboxylation of \u03b1KG via attack of the distal oxygen on C2 of \u03b1KG. It is possible that conformational change of the substrate or a shift of the oxo ligand toward the position trans to His204 before, during, or after decarboxylation of aKG may be needed to facilitate hydrogen atom abstraction. Finally, rebound of the suitably positioned halogen would yield the chlorinated product. Note that the precise positions of the oxo species in the proposed intermediates are unknown.NAtuRE CHEMiCAL BioLoGY | VOL 15 | OCTOBER 2019 | 1009\u20131016 | www.nature.com/naturechemicalbiology1011 Articles NaTure ChemICal BIologyatom abstraction to bring the substrate and Fe-center geometries within the required range31. Finally, rebound of a suitably positioned halogen would yield the chlorinated product (Fig. 2c).To further investigate catalytic selectivity in BesD, we performed alanine scan mutagenesis of active site residues in BesD. Protein variants were expressed, purified and incubated with lysine before product analysis by LC\u2013MS (Supplementary Fig. 4). Most alanine variants abolished all activity (both halogenation and hydroxyl-ation). However, three variants yielded interesting profiles (Fig. 3). Strikingly, H134A increased overall enzyme activity and abolished enzyme selectivity, resulting in decreased halogenation to hydrox-ylation ratios. The N219A variant also abolished selectivity for halogenation, albeit with reduced activity as compared to wild-type BesD. Interestingly, the T221A substitution had no effect on activ-ity or halogenation selectivity despite the conservation of a polar amino acid at position 221 in halogenases (Fig. 3c).Analysis of the BesD crystal structure in conjunction with sequence conservation of these residues suggested that His134 and Asn219 play important roles in the second-sphere interactions that control reaction partitioning. His134, which is highly conserved, is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of lysine in the BesD struc-ture and thus presumably plays an important role in orienting lysine relative to the iron complex. The loss in halogenation selectivity upon mutation of His134 is consistent with studies that implicate the precise positioning of the substrate within the active site to favor halogen rebound over hydroxyl rebound33,36. At 2.9 \u00c5 away from \u03b1KG, Asn219 may serve to orient \u03b1KG through hydrogen bond-ing such that the vacant putative oxygen-binding site is located far from the substrate. Additionally, Asn219 could be involved in orienting the FeIII\u2013OH intermediate to differentially favor halogen rebound, analogous to the proposed role of Ser189 in WelO519, if the oxo ligand does shift toward the substrate to facilitate hydro-gen atom abstraction (Supplementary Fig. 3). Upon examining the sequence conservation of key active site residues in predicted halogenase and hydroxylase sequences with homology to BesD, we found that Asn219 was highly conserved in the halogenase homo-logs while greater variability was displayed by hydroxylase homo-logs (Supplementary Fig. 5). This conservation of Asn219 further supports the importance of second-sphere interactions in the BesD amino acid halogenase family.Discovery of new amino acid halogenases. To explore the sequence space around BesD, we performed a sequence-based homology search (BLAST E-value of e-5) to identify other potential halogenase candidates. The related hydroxylases were filtered from the data-set on the basis of the presence of the characteristic HXD/E motif, as halogenases are known to possess an HXG/A motif instead to allow for halide coordination to Fe during catalysis18. To maximize sampling of functional diversity, we generated a sequence similar-ity network (SSN)37 to group the homologous enzymes into eight new putative isofunctional groups, which we termed clusters A\u2013H (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7, and Supplementary Data). Genes adjacent to putative halogenase coding sequences were analyzed with the Enzyme Function Initiative\u2019s Genome Neighborhood Tools to identify conserved genomic contexts associated with these enzymes37. This analysis revealed numerous genes encoding pro-teins predicted to be involved in amino acid metabolism, such as amino acid transporters, LysR family transcriptional regulators, serine hydroxymethyl transferases, and ATP-grasp-dependent carboxy-amine ligases (Supplementary Fig. 8).

We cloned, heterologously expressed and purified rep-resentative halogenase homologs from clusters A\u2013H and tested the proteins for activity against a panel of amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 9). The products were analyzed by LC\u2013MS, revealing newly accessible chlorinated amino acid products and identifying sub-strates for enzymes within the clusters (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 2\u20134).Among the characterized halogenases, we discovered members with different regioselectivities. BesD and enzymes from cluster A halogenate lysine at the \u03b3-carbon to produce 4-Cl-lysine (1). However, HalB from Streptomyces iranensis (SiHalB) yielded a prod-uct with the same exact mass and characteristic chlorinated isotope pattern as 4-Cl-lysine, but with a different retention time (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 10). Through NMR analysis of the methyl esterified product, we identified the product of SiHalB as 5-Cl-lysine (2; Supplementary Note 1). Although they are 43% identical, SiHalB and BesD have distinct regioselectivities, highlighting the capa-bility of FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent enzymes to perform regioselective halogenation under mild conditions. We also found halogenases that perform both mono-and dichlorination of lysine (Fig. 4c). When lysine was incubated with BesD, only monochlorinated 4-Cl-lysine was observed. However, in addition to monochlorina-tion of lysine, Legionella anisa HalC (LaHalC) could also carry out dichlorination to produce 4,4-dichlorolysine (4; Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Note 1) while HalB from Streptomyces wuyuanensis (SwHalB) yielded 5,5-dichlorolysine (3; Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Note 1). Dichlorination has been observed in radical carrier-protein-dependent halogenases as well13.In addition to differing regioselectivities, other BesD family members were identified that could act on other amino acid sub-strates. Enzymes from cluster D exhibited chain-length preference and halogenated the five-carbon substrate ornithine preferentially over the six-carbon substrate lysine. In particular, the Pseudomonas kilonensis HalD (PkHalD) was found to prefer ornithine (kcat/KM = 330 \u00b1 70 mM-1min-1) as a substrate by 25-fold over lysine (kcat/KM = 13.2 \u00b1 3.6 mM-1min-1) (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14, and Supplementary Note 1). Finally, cluster E was found to contain aliphatic amino acid halogenases. When we assayed P. sp. Root562 HalE (PrHalE), we observed no activity on the amino acids lysine and ornithine. However, when we incubated PrHalE with the aliphatic amino acids leucine, isoleucine and norleucine, we observed the expected mass and isotopic patterns for chlorinated products of those amino acids (6\u20138; Fig. 4e, Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16, and Supplementary Note 1). We additionally observed a dichlorinated species (9) when norleucine was used as a substrate. Further characterization by NMR indicated that PrHalE chlorinates leucine and isoleucine (CH2) at the \u03b3-position and norleucine at the \u03b4-position (Supplementary Note 1).Remarkably, halogenases from clusters A\u2013H have evolved to accommodate different amino acids, with regioselectivity for specific sites on those substrates, while maintaining fidelity for halogenation over the competing side reaction of hydroxylation. To further explore the structural basis for these differences, the sequences of halogenases A\u2013E were aligned (Supplementary Fig. 17). As expected, the carboxylate-and amine-binding residues Arg74, His134 and Asp140 are highly conserved, regardless of substrate preference. However, it was surprising to note that the \u03b5-amine-binding residues of BesD (Glu120, Asn219 and Thr221) were [M + H]+m/z = 215.03490 5 10 15 20 25 Time (min)LaHalC SwHalB 4 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 Time (min)BesD SiHalB [M + H]+m/z = 181.07382 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 Time (min)5 5 [M + H]+m/z = 167.0582PkHalD BesD 0 5 10 15 Time (min)6 8 7 [M + H]+m/z = 166.0629PrHalE PrHalE PrHalE O O \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 NH3 H3N O O NH3 H3N O O NH3 H3N O O NH3 H3N Cl Cl Cl Cl ClCl 21 43 O O NH3 H3N Cl 5 O O NH3 Cl 6 O O NH3 Cl Cl O O NH3 Cl O O NH3Cl 987 BesD HalB HalC HalEHalD a b c d e \u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013 Fig. 4 | Amino acid halogenase diversity. a, BesD homologs and products of enzymatic amino acid halogenation. b, Regioselective monohalogenation is observed with 4-Cl-lysine (1, m/z\u2009=\u2009181.0738) or 5-Cl-lysine (2, m/z\u2009=\u2009181.0738) produced by BesD or SiHalB, respectively. c, Regioselective dihalogenation is also observed with 5,5-dichlorolysine (3, m/z\u2009=\u2009215.0349) or 4,4-dichlorolysine (4, m/z\u2009=\u2009215.0349) produced by SwHalB or LaHalC, respectively. d, Ornithine is a substrate for both PkHalD and BesD (4-Cl-ornithine, 5, m/z\u2009=\u2009167.0582). e, The non-polar amino acids leucine, isoleucine and norleucine are substrates for PrHalE (4-Cl-leucine, 6, m/z\u2009=\u2009166.0629; 4-Cl-isoleucine, 7, m/z\u2009=\u2009166.0629; 5-Cl-norleucine, 8, m/z\u2009=\u2009166.0629).

The greatest disparity in sequence occurs at Trp238 and Trp239, which are located at the C-terminal end of the protein. Sequence alignment revealed that the C-terminal regions of haloge-nases A\u2013E are highly variable, differing by as many as ten amino acids in length and resulting in unreliable alignments of that region. Structural analysis of BesD showed that the C terminus closes over the substrate in the active site of the protein, occluding it from sol-vent (Supplementary Fig. 18). The C terminus of BesD addition-ally interacts with a corresponding internal loop near the active site (residues 117\u2013119), which also varies among the halogenase clus-ters. Combined with the structure, the sequence analysis suggested that the C terminus and the corresponding loop could be important determinants of substrate selectivity.Biosynthetic applications of amino acid halogenases. Amino acids are key building blocks for metabolism, serving as the source for many metabolites and natural products, as well as ribosomally and non-ribosomally synthesized peptides and proteins. Therefore, the discovery of the BesD family of halogenases raises the possibil-ity that halogens and other functional groups could be incorporated into these classes of compounds through engineering of down-stream biosynthetic transformations. We first examined the ability to expand the repertoire of the amino acid halogenases to carry out bromination and azidation by replacement of the Cl-ligand with Br-and N3-, respectively38. When NaCl was replaced with NaBr and NaN3, SwHalB catalyzed the corresponding bromination and azida-tion reactions as observed by LC\u2013MS (Fig. 5a). Thus, a variety of functional handles can be installed onto amino acid substrates to diversify amino acid building blocks using SwHalB simply by pro-viding an alternate ligand for the Fe complex. In particular, bromine and azide functional groups serve as handles for substitution reac-tions39 and as precursors to amines40 and nitrogen-containing het-erocycles41, respectively.Amino acids also participate in a broad range of metabolic path-ways and can be directly transformed into a variety of new com-pound classes (Fig. 5b). For example, heterocycles are key structural components in a number of bioactive molecules and drugs42 and can be made by oxidative cyclization by lysine cyclodeaminase (RapL)43 and ornithine cyclodeaminase (OCD)44 to form pipecolate and proline, respectively. To test whether the cyclodeaminase enzymes were sufficiently promiscuous to generate chlorinated heterocycles, we cloned, expressed and purified RapL and OCD (Supplementary Fig. 19). Coupled reactions with lysine or ornithine halogenases and RapL or OCD, respectively, yielded chlorinated compounds with the predicted masses and isotope patterns of chloropipecolate (10), dichloropipecolate (11) and chloroproline (12) (Supplementary Fig. 20 and 21). Thus, the newly discovered amino acid halogenases can be further enzymatically elaborated to form five-and six-mem-bered chlorinated heterocycles.Owing to the utility of diamines as precursors for polymers such as nylon45, we next sought to access chlorinated diamines through coupled enzymatic reactions. Lysine decarboxylase (LDC) catalyzes the pyrodoxal-5\u2032-phosphate (PLP)-dependent decarboxylation of lysine to 1,5-pentanediamine46. LDC from Escherichia coli was heterologously expressed and purified to evaluate its tolerance of a chlorinated substrate. To generate a chlorinated diamine, LDC was added to a reaction following the enzymatic synthesis of 5,5-dichlo-rolysine by SwHalB. A mass consistent with a dichlorinated diamine (13) was observed by LC\u2013MS (Supplementary Fig. 22). We addi-tionally accessed chlorinated \u03b1-keto acids through IlvE, an aliphatic amino acid aminotransferase. IlvE from E. coli has been shown to catalyze transamination of leucine, isoleucine and norleucine into their corresponding \u03b1-keto acids47. Incubation of enzymatically synthesized chloronorleucine with IlvE yielded products with the predicted mass and isotope pattern of chlorinated \u03b1-keto acids (14 and 15) as observed by LC\u2013MS (Supplementary Fig. 23).Finally, we investigated whether chlorolysine synthesized by BesD homologs could be incorporated into peptides with an in\u00a0vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) system48. Following incu-bation of amino acids with PfHalA or SwHalB, transcription and translational machinery from the PURExpress IVTT kit, along with a plasmid encoding a nine-amino-acid peptide, were added to the Time (min)Time (min)XLys = Lys0 1 2 3 4 [M + H]+m/z = 1137.5391Halogenase0 1 2 3 4 [M + H]+m/z = 1171.5010None HalA HalB XLys = Cl-Lysa b c 0 5 10 15 20 25 + Br+ N3+ H2Om/z = 225.0233m/z = 188.1142[M + H]+Time (min)m/z = 225.0233m/z = 188.1142+ H2OO O NH Cl O O NH O O NHCl Cl Cl 11 12 O OCl Cl O OCl 14 NH2 H2N 13 O O Cl Cl 15 10 H N H O Met Glu Thr Arg Ser XLys Asn Met Leu O O NH3 H3N O O NH3 H3N O2, X\u2013\u03b1KG,FeII X = Br, N3SwHalB X \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\u2013 Fig. 5 | Engineering downstream pathways with amino acid halogenases. a, Bromination and azidation can be carried out with BesD halogenases. Bromolysine (m/z\u2009=\u2009225.0233) and azidolysine (m/z\u2009=\u2009188.1142) are produced by SwHalB using NaBr or NaN3, respectively.

Compounds 10 and 11 are the products of incubating lysine with SwHalB and lysine cyclodeaminase; compound 12 is the product of incubating ornithine with PkHalD and ornithine cyclodeaminase; compound 13 is the product of incubating lysine with SwHalB and lysine decarboxylase; and compounds 14 and 15 are the products of incubating norleucine with PrHalE and the aliphatic amino acid transaminase, IlvE. At least three experimental replicates were carried out. c, PfHalA or SwHalB could be used to generate Cl-lysine in\u00a0situ followed by IVTT initiated by addition of PURExpress kit components along with a plasmid encoding the METRSKNML peptide. The EIC shows the production of peptides containing lysine (m/z\u2009=\u20091137.5391) or Cl-lysine (m/z\u2009=\u20091171.5010).

When the amino acids were preincubated with either halogenase, a product corresponding to the exact mass of the chlorinated peptide was detected by LC\u2013MS (Fig. 5c). Therefore, the halogenases from the BesD family can be coupled with IVTT systems to generate chlorinated peptides from 4-Cl-lysine and 5-Cl-lysine. Discussion Enzymes serve as highly useful catalysts, whose ability to achieve high selectivity and turnover numbers under mild conditions have advanced the development of streamlined syntheses of a broad range of compounds3. One particularly interesting reaction carried out by enzymes is the selective activation of C\u2013H bonds to replace them with halogen substituents, which enables the functionaliza-tion of small molecules as semisynthetic intermediates for a broad range of downstream reaction pathways or to tune the bioactivity of lead compounds. The discovery of FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent haloge-nases that can operate directly on simple amino acids expands the scope of known radical halogenation chemistry. Furthermore, this halogenase family opens the door to the biosynthetic engineering of a large number of small molecule and macromolecular targets derived from amino acid building blocks.Characterization of the radical halogenases in the BesD fam-ily has shown that these enzymes accept both polar and non-polar amino acids, demonstrate regioselective halogenation of Csp3NoneHI  bonds and carry out both mono-and dichlorination. Structural stud-ies of BesD further provide valuable insight into its substrate selec-tivity and the potential mechanisms by which reaction partitioning between halogenation and hydroxylation is achieved. In addition to showing that bromination and azidation are catalyzed by the BesD family, we have demonstrated that downstream enzymatic pathways can be constructed to utilize halogenase-modified intermediates to produce different classes of compounds, including nitrogen hetero-cycles, diamines, keto acids and ribosomally synthesized peptides. Altogether, these results highlight the potential to integrate this family of halogenases directly into engineered biological reaction pathways and expand our ability to access a wide variety of new compounds.online contentAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, statements of code and data availability and associated accession codes are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-019-0355-x.

To select halogenase homologs for functional screening, the sequence of BesD (WP_014151497) was used as a query for BLAST against the non-redundant protein database with a cutoff value of e-5, yielding 261 hits. BLAST hits were aligned using MUSCLE49 and visualized in AliView50, and the sequence position of the HXD/E or HXG/A motif was identified manually. A Biopython script was used to parse the list of alignments to segregate the halogenases (HXG/A) for storage in a separate file, yielding 105 sequences, which were retrieved using BatchEntrez (NCBI). From the list of halogenases, redundant sequences of 98% identity were removed using CD-HIT51. The remaining halogenase sequences with homology to BesD were input into the EFI-EST web tool37 (https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-est), using option C to read FASTA files with headers. After initial processing, sequences below 150 amino acids in length were excluded from the sequence similarity network. Using Cytoscape v.3.6.1, the network was adjusted by deleting edges with low alignment scores until the halogenases identified for Bes biosynthesis9 were separated into an isofunctional cluster, which occurred at an alignment score value of 88, which corresponds to a sequence identity of ~56%. The EFI-GNT web tool37 (https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-gnt) was used to identify adjacent genes that were shared among 50% of the halogenase sequences in each cluster, revealing genes associated with amino acid metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 8).Phylogenetic analysis of BesD homologs. The list of halogenases for phylogenetic analysis was obtained as described above. Halogenase sequences were aligned using MUSCLE. The MEGAX interface was then used to analyze the alignment by maximum likelihood on the basis of the JTT matrix-based model52, and uncertainty in the topology of the resulting tree was evaluated with 500 bootstrap replicates. Bioinformatic analysis of active site conservation among halogenases versus hydroxylases. Separate lists of halogenases (HXG/A motif) and hydroxylases (HXD/E motif) were obtained as described above. Redundant sequences with at least 90% identity to other sequences under consideration were removed using CD-HIT, leaving 48 halogenases and 97 hydroxylases. Next, the halogenase and hydroxylase lists were separately analyzed with LOGOS53 (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi) to generate a graphical representation of sequence conservation within each dataset.Bioinformatic analysis of the variability of the C termini of BesD halogenase homologs. As above, a list of BesD halogenase homologs within a cutoff value of e-5 was obtained. From the list of 105 halogenases, redundant sequences of 90% identity were removed using CD-HIT, leaving 48 sequences. These remaining halogenases were input into LOGOS to generate a graphical representation of sequence conservation throughout the halogenases.Bacterial strains. E. coli DH10B-T1R was used for plasmid construction. BL21(DE3)\u2013Star harboring the pRARE2 plasmid was used for heterologous protein production of all halogenases. Streptomyces cattleya NRRL 8057 (ATCC 35852) was obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection. The following strains were purchased from DSMZ: Pseudomonas orientalis (DSMZ 17489), Pseudomonas trivialis (DSMZ 14937), Pseudomonas sp. Root562 (DSMZ 102504) and Pseudomonas fulva (DSMZ 17717). Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was a gift from the Keasling laboratory (University of California, Berkeley).Construction of plasmids for protein expression. Gibson assembly was used to carry out plasmid construction using E. coli DH10B-T1R as the cloning host. PCR amplifications were carried out with Phusion polymerase or Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table 5. The intermediate cloning plasmid, pET16-His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH, was constructed by amplification of IMPDH from E. coli genomic DNA followed by insertion into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16b.

The halogenases WP_016975823 (P. fluorescens HalA), WP_044582715 (S. iranensis HalB), WP_046063366 (P. kilonensis HalD), WP_047703910 (P. mediterranea HalH) were obtained as gBlocks and amplified with primers from Supplementary Table 1 before Gibson insertion into NdeI/BamHI-digested His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH. The remaining halogenases in Supplementary Table 1 and the lysine cyclodeaminase RapL were obtained as gBlocks containing the overhangs required for direct Gibson insertion into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16-His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH. To clone mutants of S. lavenduligriseus BesD (SlBesD), SlBesD was amplified in two pieces from the pET16-His-SlBesD plasmid. The first piece was amplified with Sl-BesD-F and the reverse primers indicated in Supplementary Table 1. The second piece was amplified with the forward primers indicated in Supplementary Table 1 and either Sl-BesD-R (for R74A, E120A, H134A and D140A) or pET16-anneal-R (for N219A, T221A, W238A and W239A). Then both pieces were inserted into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16-His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH to yield the mutant constructs. pSV272.1-His6-MBP-PfRoot562 HalE was constructed by genomic DNA amplification with the primers indicated in Supplementary Table 1 followed by insertion into SfoI/EcoRI-digested pSV272.1. IVTT-PepC was cloned by vector amplification of the DHFR plasmid from the PURExpress IVTT kit (E640S, NEB) using the PepC-F/R primer set, followed by Gibson assembly. Following plasmid construction, all cloned inserts were sequenced at Quintara Biosciences or the Barker Hall Sequencing Facility at the University of California, Berkeley.Expression of His10-tagged and His6-MBP-tagged proteins. E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells harboring the pRARE2 plasmid were transformed with the appropriate protein-expression plasmid. An overnight TB culture of the freshly transformed cells was used to inoculate TB (1 l) containing the appropriate antibiotics (50 \u03bcg ml-1 carbenicillin or kanamycin with 50 \u03bcg ml-1 chloramphenicol) in a 2.8-l baffled shake flask to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) = 0.05. The cultures were grown at 37 \u00b0C at 200 rpm to OD600 of between 0.6 and 0.8 at which point, cultures were cooled on ice for 20 min, followed by induction of protein expression with IPTG (0.25 mM) and overnight growth at 16 \u00b0C. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 9,800g for 7 min at 4 \u00b0C and stored at -80 \u00b0C.Purification of His10-tagged and His6-MBP-tagged proteins. Frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended at 5 ml g-1 cell paste in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20 mM \u03b2ME and 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, pH 7.5) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The cell paste was homogenized and then lysed by passage through a French pressure cell (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 9,000 psi or by sonication with a Misonix Sonicator 3000 (power = 7.5, 5 s on, 25 s off, 2 min total process time, 0.5-inch tip). The lysate was then centrifuged at 13,500g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. DNA was precipitated in the soluble fraction with 0.15% (wt/vol) polyethyleneimine and stirring at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The precipitated DNA was then removed by centrifugation at 13,500g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The soluble lysate was incubated with Ni-NTA (0.5 ml of resin per gram of cell paste) for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C, resuspended and loaded onto a column by gravity flow. The column was washed with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 20 mM \u03b2ME and 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, pH 7.5) for 15\u201320 column volumes. The column was then eluted with elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 20 mM \u03b2ME and 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, pH 7.5). Fractions containing the target protein were pooled according to absorbance at 280 nm and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra spin concentrator (10-kDa MWCO; Millipore). Protein was then exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM sodium chloride, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) using PD-10 desalting columns. Note NAtuRE CHEMiCAL BioLoGY | Articles NaTure ChemICal BIologythat for the PLP-dependent enzymes IlvE and LDC, 20 \u00b5M PLP was present in all the purification and storage buffers. Final protein concentrations before storage are reported in Supplementary Note 2. All proteins were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.Preparation of proteins for crystallization. For the BesD halogenase from S. cattleya, the protein was dialyzed following elution from the Ni-NTA column (3 \u00d7 1:50 dilution) against dialysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) for 1.5 h to remove imidazole. After the third round of dialysis, protein was incubated with Prescission protease (1 mg protease to 50 mg protein) and dialyzed (3 \u00d7 1:50 dilution) overnight against dialysis buffer. Cleaved and dialyzed protein was passed through Ni-NTA (2 ml) to remove Prescission and the His10 tag. The eluent was then diluted to a final salt concentration of 20 mM NaCl using buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap-Q column for ion exchange with a AKTA Purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted using a gradient from 0 to 100% buffer A to buffer B (50 mM HEPES, 1 M NaCl, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) over 40 min. The protein sample was concentrated to 2 ml and loaded onto a Superdex 75 16/60-pg (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with SEC Buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The protein eluent was concentrated to 15 mg ml-1 and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 5% (vol/vol) before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at -80 \u00b0C.Crystallization and structure determination. Crystals of BesD from S. cattleya were obtained by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method by combining equal volumes of protein solution (10 mg ml-1 BesD, lysine (1.5 mM) and \u03b1KG (3 mM, pH 7)) and reservoir solution (MES (pH 6.5, 100 mM), sodium chloride (0.6 mM) and 20% (vol/vol) PEG 4000). Thick rectangular plate crystals grew in 4 d. Crystals were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 100 \u00b5l of seed buffer (MES (pH 6.5, 100 mM), sodium chloride (0.6 mM) and 40% (vol/vol) PEG 4000) at 4 \u00b0C and vortexed for 30 s with 10 \u00d7 1-mm diameter zirconia\u2013silica beads to produce a micro-seed solution. The seed solution was stored at -80 \u00b0C for future use. Fe-bound BesD crystals were prepared in a Coy anaerobic chamber by micro-seeding equal volumes of protein solution (10 mg ml-1 BesD, lysine (1.5 mM), \u03b1KG (3 mM, pH 7)) and reservoir solution (MES (pH 6.5, 100 mM), sodium chloride (0.6 mM) and 20% (vol/vol) PEG 4000). Thick rectangular rods grew within 2 weeks. Crystals were soaked anaerobically in a solution containing (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2\u00b76H2O (1 mM), \u03b1KG (1 mM), sodium ascorbate (1 mM), lysine (1 mM) and glycerol (20% (vol/vol)) for 30 min before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at Beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) at a wavelength of 1.11 \u00c5.Data were processed with XDS54 and scaled and merged with Aimless55 within the CCP4 suite56. The anomalous signal from the Fe atoms was sufficient for obtaining initial phases using the CRANK2 pipeline57. Bucaneer58 was used to build an initial model of the structure, which was refined iteratively in COOT59 and Phenix60. Ligands were added to the model using COOT and refined in Phenix. The overall B factors of the protein are higher than that of the ligands owing to partially disordered regions of the protein. However, the B factors of the ligands are similar to those of the surrounding protein residues in the active site. Omit maps for the ligand complex including Fe, Cl, \u03b1KG, lysine, His137 and His204 were generated using the Phenix Map function. Fe, Cl, \u03b1KG, lysine, His137 and His204 were selected for removal from refinement before calculation of the maps. No map is visible around those ligands at the -3\u03c3 contour level. The structure was analyzed in Pymol, which was also used to create figures.General procedure for high-resolution HPLC\u2013MS analysis of polar metabolites with hydrophilic interaction LC.

        "mcchang@berkeley.eduThe expansion of chemical diversity drives the discovery of small molecules and macromolecules with new function. In this regard, both synthetic and cellular chemistry provide access to an extremely broad range of compounds, but the struc-tural space occupied by molecules made by humans as compared to those made by nature are often orthogonal. While living systems use the unparalleled selectivity of enzymes to construct molecules with a limited set of functional groups, synthetic methods instead utilize an extensive range of strategies for bond formation. As such, the development of approaches to bridge synthetic and cellular chemis-try can help us to gain access to new structures and classes of com-pounds by combining the exquisite selectivity of enzymes with the breadth of functional groups used for synthetic transformations1\u20133. The introduction of halogens (X = F, Cl, Br, I) into a functional group-dense scaffold is especially useful, serving both to tune bio-activity4,5 and to act as a reactive handle for the formation of new chemical bonds for diversification and modification of late-stage synthetic intermediates6,7. While the role of halogens in biosynthetic transformations is still being elucidated8\u201311, their value in a variety of synthetic transformations and the design of synthetic routes is well accepted12. As a result, both synthetic and enzymatic approaches to the formation of carbon\u2013halogen bonds are currently areas of major interest6\u20138,13\u201315.",
        "The selective modification of unactivated sp3 C\u2013H bonds is par-ticularly difficult, as it is challenging to identify catalysts that are sufficiently powerful to activate these bonds while maintaining regio-and stereoselectivity16. Remarkably, nature has evolved a set of non-heme FeII/\u03b1-ketoglutarate (FeII/\u03b1KG)-dependent halogenase enzymes that can achieve this task, using a high-valent metal\u2013oxo intermediate to generate a substrate radical that can rebound with the bound halide ligand17\u201319. However, only a handful of these radi-cal halogenases have been characterized and are notable for their complex substrates13. The SyrB2 family has been found to main-tain a strict requirement for carrier-protein-tethered substrates20, whereas the WelO5 family halogenates late-stage indole alkaloid natural products21. As these types of intermediates are not readily modified using downstream enzymatic pathways, the discovery of new enzymes that act on simple and modular building blocks would greatly expand the biosynthetic potential of radical halogenation. We recently discovered a radical halogenase, BesD, that chlorinates the free amino acid lysine, making it the first of the \u03b1KG-dependent radical halogenases reported to chlorinate an amino acid without the requirement for a carrier",
        "protein9.In this work, we solved the crystal structure of BesD in com-plex with its substrate lysine to better understand the basis for direct halogenation of amino acids. We have also identified additional members of this new family of radical halogenases that chlorinate different polar and non-polar amino acids with varied regioselec-tivity by investigating the unexplored sequence space around the FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent halogenase, BesD. Additional active site muta-genesis and bioinformatic analysis provide further insight into the reaction mechanism of these enzymes and how they catalyze selec-tive chlorination. Taking advantage of the central role of amino acid building blocks in the cellular production of metabolites, natural products and macromolecules22\u201324, we demonstrate that the halo-genated amino acid products can be further converted enzymati-cally to a range of compound classes such as nitrogen heterocycles, amines, keto acids and peptides.

        "halogenases26.To gain a better mechanistic understanding of BesD, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of BesD with lysine, Fe, chlorine and \u03b1KG bound in the active site (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). BesD was crystallized anaerobically with lysine and \u03b1KG, and soaked with FeII. The X-ray structure was solved at a resolution of 1.95 \u00c5 by Fe-SAD phasing. The structure contains four BesD mono-mers in the asymmetric unit, all of which possess the \u03b2-sandwich topology that is characteristic of Fe/\u03b1KG enzymes18. Each monomer contains a single Fe coordinated by His137, His204, chloride and \u03b1KG in a distorted square pyramidal geometry in the active site, which contains the HXG/A motif that is characteristic of haloge-nases. The binding site for lysine in BesD is largely polar, with a network of hydrogen bonds for binding to the carboxylate (Arg74, His134 and Trp238), \u03b1-amine (Asp140) and \u03b5-amine (Glu120, Asn219 and Thr221) of the substrate (Fig. 1c,d). In addition, Trp239 on the C terminus of the protein stacks over the aliphatic side chain of lysine, closing over the substrate at the entrance of the active site. The structure also revealed a water network between Thr221 and the chloride",
        "ligand.The crystal structure highlighted differences in substrate bind-ing between BesD and the carrier-protein-dependent amino acid halogenases. In BesD, the positioning of the lysine substrate appears to be strongly determined by a two-point interaction between the free carboxylate of lysine and the guanidinium group of an active site arginine (Arg74). By contrast, in SyrB2, the carboxylate of the threonine substrate is ligated to a phosphopantetheine (Ppant) arm, which both tethers threonine to the carrier protein (SyrB1) through a thioester linkage and masks the carboxylate. It has been proposed that the Thr\u2013Ppant arm enters the active site through a tunnel and that interactions with threonine and the Ppant arm, as well as SyrB1, are likely important for positioning the substrate in the active site for catalysis27,28. Another notable difference is that BesD appears to have a covering lid that holds lysine in the active site for cataly-sis. This substrate-binding mode is more reminiscent of the indole alkaloid halogenase, WelO5, in which the substrate is held into place by a helix that closes over the active",

        "BIologyand \u03b1KG, both hydroxylases and halogenases generate a high-valent FeIV\u2013oxo species, which can abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate31. For hydroxylases, rebound of the substrate radical with the resulting hydroxo group is the only possible pathway, as the coordination site occupied by a halide in halogenases is filled by the Asp or Glu ligand from the HXD/E motif. In halogenases, however, rebound with either the halogen or the hydroxyl radical is possible, leading to potential reaction partitioning between haloge-nation and hydroxylation, respectively32 (Supplementary Fig. 2). In the case of BesD, substitution of the active site glycine of the HXG motif to an aspartate eliminates halogenation activity and results in only hydroxylation9. Indeed, it has been shown that halogenases can carry out a low level of off-pathway hydroxylation, especially when challenged with non-native substrates33. Efforts to engineer halogenases from hydroxylases have also been difficult, suggesting that second-sphere interactions are important in controlling reac-tion",
        "partitioning34.Combining insights from our structure with previous studies of FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent enzymes17, we can propose a mechanism for halogenation by BesD. Halogenases must orient the FeIV\u2013oxo inter-mediate such that it is suitably positioned to perform hydrogen atom abstraction while disfavoring rebound of the resulting FeIII\u2013OH intermediate in favor of FeIII\u2013Cl rebound. Our structure captured under anaerobic conditions most likely represents a snapshot of the active site before oxygen binding. By analogy to other FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent enzymes in the literature18,19, the putative vacant site for oxygen binding appears to be trans to His137, on the opposite side of the His204\u2013Cl\u2013\u03b1KG plane from the substrate carbon that is tar-geted for hydrogen atom abstraction (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3). If the oxo moiety remains trans to His137 upon formation of the FeIV\u2013oxo intermediate, and if the substrate position does not change, the distance between the oxo moiety and site of hydrogen atom abstraction (C4 of lysine) would be ~5.0 \u00c5 on the basis of the FeII\u2013C4(lysine) distance (4.8 \u00c5) and the estimated FeIV\u2013oxo bond length (1.6 \u00c5)31. While the precise structures of the reaction inter-mediates are unknown, this distance is longer than that calculated from density-functional theory studies on SyrB2 (ref. 31). It is also possible that conformational change of the substrate or a shift19,35 of the oxo ligand toward the position trans to His204 before, during or after decarboxylation of \u03b1KG may be needed to facilitate hydrogen",

        "2c).To further investigate catalytic selectivity in BesD, we performed alanine scan mutagenesis of active site residues in BesD. Protein variants were expressed, purified and incubated with lysine before product analysis by LC\u2013MS (Supplementary Fig. 4). Most alanine variants abolished all activity (both halogenation and hydroxyl-ation). However, three variants yielded interesting profiles (Fig. 3). Strikingly, H134A increased overall enzyme activity and abolished enzyme selectivity, resulting in decreased halogenation to hydrox-ylation ratios. The N219A variant also abolished selectivity for halogenation, albeit with reduced activity as compared to wild-type BesD. Interestingly, the T221A substitution had no effect on activ-ity or halogenation selectivity despite the conservation of a polar amino acid at position 221 in halogenases (Fig.",
        "3c).Analysis of the BesD crystal structure in conjunction with sequence conservation of these residues suggested that His134 and Asn219 play important roles in the second-sphere interactions that control reaction partitioning. His134, which is highly conserved, is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of lysine in the BesD struc-ture and thus presumably plays an important role in orienting lysine relative to the iron complex. The loss in halogenation selectivity upon mutation of His134 is consistent with studies that implicate the precise positioning of the substrate within the active site to favor halogen rebound over hydroxyl rebound33,36. At 2.9 \u00c5 away from \u03b1KG, Asn219 may serve to orient \u03b1KG through hydrogen bond-ing such that the vacant putative oxygen-binding site is located far from the substrate. Additionally, Asn219 could be involved in orienting the FeIII\u2013OH intermediate to differentially favor halogen rebound, analogous to the proposed role of Ser189 in WelO519, if the oxo ligand does shift toward the substrate to facilitate hydro-gen atom abstraction (Supplementary Fig. 3). Upon examining the sequence conservation of key active site residues in predicted halogenase and hydroxylase sequences with homology to BesD, we found that Asn219 was highly conserved in the halogenase homo-logs while greater variability was displayed by hydroxylase homo-logs (Supplementary Fig. 5). This conservation of Asn219 further supports the importance of second-sphere interactions in the BesD amino acid halogenase",
        "family.Discovery of new amino acid halogenases. To explore the sequence space around BesD, we performed a sequence-based homology search (BLAST E-value of e-5) to identify other potential halogenase candidates. The related hydroxylases were filtered from the data-set on the basis of the presence of the characteristic HXD/E motif, as halogenases are known to possess an HXG/A motif instead to allow for halide coordination to Fe during catalysis18. To maximize sampling of functional diversity, we generated a sequence similar-ity network (SSN)37 to group the homologous enzymes into eight new putative isofunctional groups, which we termed clusters A\u2013H (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7, and Supplementary Data).

We also found halogenases that perform both mono-and dichlorination of lysine (Fig. 4c). When lysine was incubated with BesD, only monochlorinated 4-Cl-lysine was observed. However, in addition to monochlorina-tion of lysine, Legionella anisa HalC (LaHalC) could also carry out dichlorination to produce 4,4-dichlorolysine (4; Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Note 1) while HalB from Streptomyces wuyuanensis (SwHalB) yielded 5,5-dichlorolysine (3; Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Note 1).

In particular, the Pseudomonas kilonensis HalD (PkHalD) was found to prefer ornithine (kcat/KM = 330 \u00b1 70 mM-1min-1) as a substrate by 25-fold over lysine (kcat/KM = 13.2 \u00b1 3.6 mM-1min-1) (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14, and Supplementary Note 1). Finally, cluster E was found to contain aliphatic amino acid halogenases. When we assayed P. sp. Root562 HalE (PrHalE), we observed no activity on the amino acids lysine and ornithine. However, when we incubated PrHalE with the aliphatic amino acids leucine, isoleucine and norleucine, we observed the expected mass and isotopic patterns for chlorinated products of those amino acids (6\u20138; Fig. 4e, Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16, and Supplementary Note 1). We additionally observed a dichlorinated species (9) when norleucine was used as a substrate. Further characterization by NMR indicated that PrHalE chlorinates leucine and isoleucine (CH2) at the \u03b3-position and norleucine at the \u03b4-position (Supplementary Note",
        "1).Remarkably, halogenases from clusters A\u2013H have evolved to accommodate different amino acids, with regioselectivity for specific sites on those substrates, while maintaining fidelity for halogenation over the competing side reaction of hydroxylation. To further explore the structural basis for these differences, the sequences of halogenases A\u2013E were aligned (Supplementary Fig. 17). As expected, the carboxylate-and amine-binding residues Arg74, His134 and Asp140 are highly conserved, regardless of substrate preference. However, it was surprising to note that the \u03b5-amine-binding residues of BesD (Glu120, Asn219 and Thr221) were",

Sequence alignment revealed that the C-terminal regions of haloge-nases A\u2013E are highly variable, differing by as many as ten amino acids in length and resulting in unreliable alignments of that region. Structural analysis of BesD showed that the C terminus closes over the substrate in the active site of the protein, occluding it from sol-vent (Supplementary Fig. 18). The C terminus of BesD addition-ally interacts with a corresponding internal loop near the active site (residues 117\u2013119), which also varies among the halogenase clus-ters. Combined with the structure, the sequence analysis suggested that the C terminus and the corresponding loop could be important determinants of substrate",
        "selectivity.Biosynthetic applications of amino acid halogenases. Amino acids are key building blocks for metabolism, serving as the source for many metabolites and natural products, as well as ribosomally and non-ribosomally synthesized peptides and proteins. Therefore, the discovery of the BesD family of halogenases raises the possibil-ity that halogens and other functional groups could be incorporated into these classes of compounds through engineering of down-stream biosynthetic transformations. We first examined the ability to expand the repertoire of the amino acid halogenases to carry out bromination and azidation by replacement of the Cl-ligand with Br-and N3-, respectively38. When NaCl was replaced with NaBr and NaN3, SwHalB catalyzed the corresponding bromination and azida-tion reactions as observed by LC\u2013MS (Fig. 5a). Thus, a variety of functional handles can be installed onto amino acid substrates to diversify amino acid building blocks using SwHalB simply by pro-viding an alternate ligand for the Fe complex. In particular, bromine and azide functional groups serve as handles for substitution reac-tions39 and as precursors to amines40 and nitrogen-containing het-erocycles41,",
        "respectively.Amino acids also participate in a broad range of metabolic path-ways and can be directly transformed into a variety of new com-pound classes (Fig. 5b). For example, heterocycles are key structural components in a number of bioactive molecules and drugs42 and can be made by oxidative cyclization by lysine cyclodeaminase (RapL)43 and ornithine cyclodeaminase (OCD)44 to form pipecolate and proline, respectively. To test whether the cyclodeaminase enzymes were sufficiently promiscuous to generate chlorinated heterocycles, we cloned, expressed and purified RapL and OCD (Supplementary Fig. 19). Coupled reactions with lysine or ornithine halogenases and RapL or OCD, respectively, yielded chlorinated compounds with the predicted masses and isotope patterns of chloropipecolate (10), dichloropipecolate (11) and chloroproline (12) (Supplementary Fig. 20 and 21). Thus, the newly discovered amino acid halogenases can be further enzymatically elaborated to form five-and six-mem-bered chlorinated",
        "heterocycles.Owing to the utility of diamines as precursors for polymers such as nylon45, we next sought to access chlorinated diamines through coupled enzymatic reactions. Lysine decarboxylase (LDC) catalyzes the pyrodoxal-5\u2032-phosphate (PLP)-dependent decarboxylation of lysine to 1,5-pentanediamine46. LDC from Escherichia coli was heterologously expressed and purified to evaluate its tolerance of a chlorinated substrate. To generate a chlorinated diamine, LDC was added to a reaction following the enzymatic synthesis of 5,5-dichlo-rolysine by SwHalB. A mass consistent with a dichlorinated diamine (13) was observed by LC\u2013MS (Supplementary Fig. 22). We addi-tionally accessed chlorinated \u03b1-keto acids through IlvE, an aliphatic amino acid aminotransferase. IlvE from E. coli has been shown to catalyze transamination of leucine, isoleucine and norleucine into their corresponding \u03b1-keto acids47. Incubation of enzymatically synthesized chloronorleucine with IlvE yielded products with the predicted mass and isotope pattern of chlorinated \u03b1-keto acids (14 and 15) as observed by LC\u2013MS (Supplementary Fig.",

One particularly interesting reaction carried out by enzymes is the selective activation of C\u2013H bonds to replace them with halogen substituents, which enables the functionaliza-tion of small molecules as semisynthetic intermediates for a broad range of downstream reaction pathways or to tune the bioactivity of lead compounds. The discovery of FeII/\u03b1KG-dependent haloge-nases that can operate directly on simple amino acids expands the scope of known radical halogenation chemistry. Furthermore, this halogenase family opens the door to the biosynthetic engineering of a large number of small molecule and macromolecular targets derived from amino acid building",

To select halogenase homologs for functional screening, the sequence of BesD (WP_014151497) was used as a query for BLAST against the non-redundant protein database with a cutoff value of e-5, yielding 261 hits. BLAST hits were aligned using MUSCLE49 and visualized in AliView50, and the sequence position of the HXD/E or HXG/A motif was identified manually. A Biopython script was used to parse the list of alignments to segregate the halogenases (HXG/A) for storage in a separate file, yielding 105 sequences, which were retrieved using BatchEntrez (NCBI). From the list of halogenases, redundant sequences of 98% identity were removed using CD-HIT51. The remaining halogenase sequences with homology to BesD were input into the EFI-EST web tool37 (https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-est), using option C to read FASTA files with headers. After initial processing, sequences below 150 amino acids in length were excluded from the sequence similarity network. Using Cytoscape v.3.6.1, the network was adjusted by deleting edges with low alignment scores until the halogenases identified for Bes biosynthesis9 were separated into an isofunctional cluster, which occurred at an alignment score value of 88, which corresponds to a sequence identity of ~56%. The EFI-GNT web tool37 (https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-gnt) was used to identify adjacent genes that were shared among 50% of the halogenase sequences in each cluster, revealing genes associated with amino acid metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 8).Phylogenetic analysis of BesD homologs. The list of halogenases for phylogenetic analysis was obtained as described above. Halogenase sequences were aligned using MUSCLE. The MEGAX interface was then used to analyze the alignment by maximum likelihood on the basis of the JTT matrix-based model52, and uncertainty in the topology of the resulting tree was evaluated with 500 bootstrap replicates. Bioinformatic analysis of active site conservation among halogenases versus hydroxylases. Separate lists of halogenases (HXG/A motif) and hydroxylases (HXD/E motif) were obtained as described above. Redundant sequences with at least 90% identity to other sequences under consideration were removed using CD-HIT, leaving 48 halogenases and 97 hydroxylases. Next, the halogenase and hydroxylase lists were separately analyzed with LOGOS53 (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi) to generate a graphical representation of sequence conservation within each dataset.Bioinformatic analysis of the variability of the C termini of BesD halogenase homologs. As above, a list of BesD halogenase homologs within a cutoff value of e-5 was obtained. From the list of 105 halogenases, redundant sequences of 90% identity were removed using CD-HIT, leaving 48 sequences. These remaining halogenases were input into LOGOS to generate a graphical representation of sequence conservation throughout the halogenases.Bacterial strains. E. coli DH10B-T1R was used for plasmid construction. BL21(DE3)\u2013Star harboring the pRARE2 plasmid was used for heterologous protein production of all halogenases. Streptomyces cattleya NRRL 8057 (ATCC 35852) was obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection. The following strains were purchased from DSMZ: Pseudomonas orientalis (DSMZ 17489), Pseudomonas trivialis (DSMZ 14937), Pseudomonas sp. Root562 (DSMZ 102504) and Pseudomonas fulva (DSMZ 17717). Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was a gift from the Keasling laboratory (University of California, Berkeley).Construction of plasmids for protein expression. Gibson assembly was used to carry out plasmid construction using E. coli DH10B-T1R as the cloning host. PCR amplifications were carried out with Phusion polymerase or Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table 5. The intermediate cloning plasmid, pET16-His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH, was constructed by amplification of IMPDH from E. coli genomic DNA followed by insertion into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16b. The halogenases WP_014151497 (S. cattleya BesD), WP_057723975 (P. orientalis HalA), WP_057008702 (P. trivialis HalD), WP_056854138 (P. sp. Root562 HalE) and WP_028687259 (P. fulva HalE), as well as LDC WP_001020973 (E. coli), aminotransferase 1104250A (IlvE, E. coli) and OCD WP_010954390 (P. putida KT2440) were amplified from genomic DNA of the corresponding organisms and inserted into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16-His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH. The halogenases WP_016975823 (P. fluorescens HalA), WP_044582715 (S. iranensis HalB), WP_046063366 (P. kilonensis HalD), WP_047703910 (P. mediterranea HalH) were obtained as gBlocks and amplified with primers from Supplementary Table 1 before Gibson insertion into NdeI/BamHI-digested His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH. The remaining halogenases in Supplementary Table 1 and the lysine cyclodeaminase RapL were obtained as gBlocks containing the overhangs required for direct Gibson insertion into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16-His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH. To clone mutants of S. lavenduligriseus BesD (SlBesD), SlBesD was amplified in two pieces from the pET16-His-SlBesD plasmid. The first piece was amplified with Sl-BesD-F and the reverse primers indicated in Supplementary Table 1. The second piece was amplified with the forward primers indicated in Supplementary Table 1 and either Sl-BesD-R (for R74A, E120A, H134A and D140A) or pET16-anneal-R (for N219A, T221A, W238A and W239A). Then both pieces were inserted into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16-His-PrescissionCutSite-IMPDH to yield the mutant constructs. pSV272.1-His6-MBP-PfRoot562 HalE was constructed by genomic DNA amplification with the primers indicated in Supplementary Table 1 followed by insertion into SfoI/EcoRI-digested pSV272.1. IVTT-PepC was cloned by vector amplification of the DHFR plasmid from the PURExpress IVTT kit (E640S, NEB) using the PepC-F/R primer set, followed by Gibson assembly. Following plasmid construction, all cloned inserts were sequenced at Quintara Biosciences or the Barker Hall Sequencing Facility at the University of California, Berkeley.Expression of His10-tagged and His6-MBP-tagged proteins. E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells harboring the pRARE2 plasmid were transformed with the appropriate protein-expression plasmid. An overnight TB culture of the freshly transformed cells was used to inoculate TB (1 l) containing the appropriate antibiotics (50 \u03bcg ml-1 carbenicillin or kanamycin with 50 \u03bcg ml-1 chloramphenicol) in a 2.8-l baffled shake flask to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) = 0.05. The cultures were grown at 37 \u00b0C at 200 rpm to OD600 of between 0.6 and 0.8 at which point, cultures were cooled on ice for 20 min, followed by induction of protein expression with IPTG (0.25 mM) and overnight growth at 16 \u00b0C. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 9,800g for 7 min at 4 \u00b0C and stored at -80 \u00b0C.Purification of His10-tagged and His6-MBP-tagged proteins. Frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended at 5 ml g-1 cell paste in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20 mM \u03b2ME and 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, pH 7.5) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The cell paste was homogenized and then lysed by passage through a French pressure cell (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 9,000 psi or by sonication with a Misonix Sonicator 3000 (power = 7.5, 5 s on, 25 s off, 2 min total process time, 0.5-inch tip). The lysate was then centrifuged at 13,500g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. DNA was precipitated in the soluble fraction with 0.15% (wt/vol) polyethyleneimine and stirring at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The precipitated DNA was then removed by centrifugation at 13,500g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The soluble lysate was incubated with Ni-NTA (0.5 ml of resin per gram of cell paste) for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C, resuspended and loaded onto a column by gravity flow. The column was washed with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 20 mM \u03b2ME and 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, pH 7.5) for 15\u201320 column volumes. The column was then eluted with elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 20 mM \u03b2ME and 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, pH 7.5). Fractions containing the target protein were pooled according to absorbance at 280 nm and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra spin concentrator (10-kDa MWCO; Millipore). Protein was then exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM sodium chloride, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) using PD-10 desalting columns. Note",

        "BIologythat for the PLP-dependent enzymes IlvE and LDC, 20 \u00b5M PLP was present in all the purification and storage buffers. Final protein concentrations before storage are reported in Supplementary Note 2. All proteins were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.Preparation of proteins for crystallization. For the BesD halogenase from S. cattleya, the protein was dialyzed following elution from the Ni-NTA column (3 \u00d7 1:50 dilution) against dialysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) for 1.5 h to remove imidazole. After the third round of dialysis, protein was incubated with Prescission protease (1 mg protease to 50 mg protein) and dialyzed (3 \u00d7 1:50 dilution) overnight against dialysis buffer. Cleaved and dialyzed protein was passed through Ni-NTA (2 ml) to remove Prescission and the His10 tag. The eluent was then diluted to a final salt concentration of 20 mM NaCl using buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap-Q column for ion exchange with a AKTA Purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted using a gradient from 0 to 100% buffer A to buffer B (50 mM HEPES, 1 M NaCl, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) over 40 min. The protein sample was concentrated to 2 ml and loaded onto a Superdex 75 16/60-pg (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with SEC Buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The protein eluent was concentrated to 15 mg ml-1 and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 5% (vol/vol) before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at -80 \u00b0C.Crystallization and structure determination. Crystals of BesD from S. cattleya were obtained by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method by combining equal volumes of protein solution (10 mg ml-1 BesD, lysine (1.5 mM) and \u03b1KG (3 mM, pH 7)) and reservoir solution (MES (pH 6.5, 100 mM), sodium chloride (0.6 mM) and 20% (vol/vol) PEG 4000). Thick rectangular plate crystals grew in 4 d. Crystals were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 100 \u00b5l of seed buffer (MES (pH 6.5, 100 mM), sodium chloride (0.6 mM) and 40% (vol/vol) PEG 4000) at 4 \u00b0C and vortexed for 30 s with 10 \u00d7 1-mm diameter zirconia\u2013silica beads to produce a micro-seed solution. The seed solution was stored at -80 \u00b0C for future use. Fe-bound BesD crystals were prepared in a Coy anaerobic chamber by micro-seeding equal volumes of protein solution (10 mg ml-1 BesD, lysine (1.5 mM), \u03b1KG (3 mM, pH 7)) and reservoir solution (MES (pH 6.5, 100 mM), sodium chloride (0.6 mM) and 20% (vol/vol) PEG 4000). Thick rectangular rods grew within 2 weeks. Crystals were soaked anaerobically in a solution containing (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2\u00b76H2O (1 mM), \u03b1KG (1 mM), sodium ascorbate (1 mM), lysine (1 mM) and glycerol (20% (vol/vol)) for 30 min before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at Beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) at a wavelength of 1.11",
        "\u00c5.Data were processed with XDS54 and scaled and merged with Aimless55 within the CCP4 suite56. The anomalous signal from the Fe atoms was sufficient for obtaining initial phases using the CRANK2 pipeline57. Bucaneer58 was used to build an initial model of the structure, which was refined iteratively in COOT59 and Phenix60. Ligands were added to the model using COOT and refined in Phenix. The overall B factors of the protein are higher than that of the ligands owing to partially disordered regions of the protein. However, the B factors of the ligands are similar to those of the surrounding protein residues in the active site. Omit maps for the ligand complex including Fe, Cl, \u03b1KG, lysine, His137 and His204 were generated using the Phenix Map function. Fe, Cl, \u03b1KG, lysine, His137 and His204 were selected for removal from refinement before calculation of the maps. No map is visible around those ligands at the -3\u03c3 contour level. The structure was analyzed in Pymol, which was also used to create figures.General procedure for high-resolution HPLC\u2013MS analysis of polar metabolites with hydrophilic interaction LC. Samples containing polar metabolites were analyzed using an Agilent 1290 UPLC on a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC (5 \u03bcm, 2.1 \u00d7 100 mm; EMD-Millipore) using the following buffers: buffer A (90% acetonitrile, 10% water and 10 mM ammonium formate) and buffer B (90% water, 10% acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium formate). A linear gradient from 95% to 60% buffer A over 17 min followed by a linear gradient from 60% to 33% buffer A over 8 min was then applied at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min-1. Mass spectra were acquired in positive-ionization mode using an Agilent 6530 QTOF (Agilent).In\u00a0vitro screening of BesD homolog activity. Reactions (50 \u00b5l) contained the l-alanine, l-arginine, l-asparagine, l-aspartate, l-cysteine, l-glutamine, l-glutamate, l-glycine, l-histidine, l-isoleucine, l-leucine, l-lysine, l-methionine, l-phenylalanine, l-proline, l-serine, l-threonine, l-tryptophan, l-valine, l-ornithine and dl-norleucine (0.5 mM each), as well as sodium \u03b1KG (5 mM), sodium ascorbate (1 mM), (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2\u00b76H2O (1 mM) and sodium chloride (5 mM) in 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). Reactions were initiated by addition of purified halogenase variants (10 \u00b5M final concentration) and allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature before quenching in 2 volumes of methanol with 1% (vol/vol) formic acid. Samples were then analyzed by LC\u2013MS on an Agilent 1290 UPLC-6530 QTOF using the protocol for polar metabolite analysis described above. Following identification of substrates from the amino acid pool, the reactions were repeated with individual amino acids lysine, ornithine, leucine, isoleucine and norleucine tested separately (0.5 mM each). In the case of the aliphatic halogenases that chlorinate leucine, isoleucine and norleucine, the enzymes were reassayed against each of the three amino acids separately (0.5 mM each) to confirm activity, as the substrates and products of these isomers have the same exact mass.In\u00a0vitro halogenation assay of BesD mutants.
