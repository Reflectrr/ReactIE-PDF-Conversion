After suc-cessful expression of the enzyme in Escherichia coli, two rounds of screening and selection, saturationmutagenesis of a \u201chot spot,\u201d and rational recombination, a triple mutant (P395D/L241V/T343A) was obtained that showed a 100-fold increase in activity at pH 8 (kcat None 100 sNone1). The increased Km values for BrNone (3.1 mM) and H2O2 (16NoneM) are smaller than those found for vanadiumbromoper-oxidases that are reasonably active at this pH. In addition the bro-minating activity at pH 5 was increased by a factor of 6 (kcat None 575 sNone1), and the chlorinating activity at pH 5 was increased by a factor of 2 (kcat None 36 sNone1), yielding the \u201cbest\u201d vanadium haloper-oxidase known thus far. The mutations are in the first and second coordination sphere of the vanadate cofactor, and the catalytic effects suggest that fine tuning of residues Lys-353 and Phe-397, alongwith addition of negative charge or removal of positive charge near one of the vanadate oxygens, is very important. Lys-353 and Phe-397were previously assigned to be essential in peroxide activa-tion and halide binding. Analysis of the catalytic parameters of the mutant vanadium bromoperoxidase from the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum also adds fuel to the discussion regarding factors governing thehalidespecificityofvanadiumhaloperoxidases.This studypresents the first example of directed evolution of a vanadium enzyme. Haloperoxidases catalyze the oxidation of halides to hypohalous acids (see Equation 1), an industrially interesting reaction; these enzymes can be used to halogenate various organic compounds (1, 2) (see Equation 2). In addition they may provide an alternative biocide in antifouling applications (3\u20135) or may be used as a component in disinfectants and in detergent formulations for bleaching purposes (6\u20138). Equations 1 and 2 illustrate the reactions occuring. H2O2 None X None None H None 3 HOX None H2O (Eq. 1) HOX None AH3 AX None H2O (Eq. 2) where X is clorine, bromine, or iodine, and A is an organic nucleophilic acceptor. Presently two classes of enzymes are known that efficiently catalyze the oxidation of a halide by hydrogen peroxide, the vanadium haloper-oxidases and the heme peroxidases. The heme peroxidases have a sig-nificant disadvantage of rapid inactivation during turnover because of an oxidative reaction of the heme groupwith the peroxide substrate and the formed hypohalous acids. Vanadium haloperoxidases (VHPOs),2 which contain vanadate (VO43None) as a prosthetic group, do not suffer from this disadvantage (9); in addition they are much more resistant toward heat, detergent, and solvent denaturation (10). Themajor draw-back of all haloperoxidases including the stable VHPOs is that they are mainly active at mildly acidic pH values, whereas for many applications activity at mildly alkaline pH values is required. An example of this is their potential use as an antifouling agent in marine paints (3\u20135), an application inspired by their putative role in vivo.Many brown seaweeds contain vanadium haloperoxidases that are present on the plant surface (11), and apart from the direct antimicrobial activity ofHOBr andHOCl it was demonstrated that these hypohalous acids react rapidly with homoserine lactone derivatives produced by bacteria as communica-tion signals (quorum sensing) thus preventing biofilm formation on the surface of these seaweeds (12). Current antifouling technologies are often very environmentally unfriendly, but still being used because of the absence of good alternatives. Crystal structures of VHPOs have shown peculiar vanadium chem-istry: the enzymes shuttle between a trigonal bipyramidal structure (native) and a distorted tetragonal structure (peroxo-intermediate) (see Fig. 1). Despite considerable additional data (kinetic, genetic, muta-tional, and spectroscopic) onVHPOs fromdifferent organisms (16\u201318), several questions about these enzymes remain to be answered. Espe-cially the factors governing the halide specificity and pH optima are not fully understood. Fig. 2 shows a picture emerging from three previously published proposals (14, 15, 19) on the differences between vanadium chloroperoxidases (VCPOs) and vanadium bromoperoxidases (VBPOs). It was suggested that binding of the halide in VCPO is assisted by residues Phe-397 and Trp-350 via their NoneNone ring edge (19). The VBPOs have a histidine in the position corresponding to Phe-397 and the VBPOs from the marine algae Corallina officinalis and Corallina pilulifera have an arginine in the position of Trp-350 (17), thereby sug-gesting that differences in specificity may be partially explained by amino acid variations at these two positions. In addition to differences in direct binding of the halide, it was suggested that in the VBPO from the seaweedAscophyllumnodosum the bound peroxide is deprotonated by His-411 (Fig. 2), thereby reducing the oxidative strength of these enzymes and their affinity for the halide (14). The assigned full positive charge on the protonated peroxide oxygen in VCPOwas also suggested * This work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), The Netherlands Technology Foundation (STW), the Dutch National Research School Combination (NRSC-Catalysis), and DSM Research.

THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOL. 281, NO. 14, pp. 9738 \u20139744, April 7, 2006 \u00a9 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Printed in the U.S.A. 9738 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281 \u2022 NUMBER 14 \u2022 APRIL 7, 2006 This is an Open Access article under theCC BY to give rise to the very strong uncompetitive inhibition by azide seen in VCPO, being absent in wild-type VBPOs (20). A VBPOmutant from C. pilulifera that essentially has become a VCPO was also strongly inhib-ited by azide (21). The His-411 of VBPO from A. nodosum also forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytically important Lys-341, and it was suggested that this decreases the polarizing effect of this histidine on the bound peroxide (15). A clear explanation for the pH profiles in these enzymes is lacking, but interestingly, the optima of the VBPOs are shifted to more neutral pH values (5.5\u20136.0) as compared with the VCPOs (pH 4.5\u20135.0). Attempts to rationally modify the properties of these enzymes by site-directed mutagenesis have only met limited suc-cess. Two variants ofVCPO from the fungusCurvularia inaequaliswith a reduced positive charge near the vanadate cofactor (R360A and R490A) showed higher brominating activity at alkaline pH; however these mutants inactivated during turnover and lost most of their ability to oxidize chloride (22). The most successful attempt to date has been a site-directedmutagenesis study in which substantial chlorinating activ-ity (40 sNone1) was introduced in a VBPO from the marine algae C. pilulif-era (mutants R397W and R397F); however the reported Km values for ClNone of two mutants were very high (None700 mM) (22). In this study we have used directed evolution techniques to improve the activity of VCPO from C. inaequalis at mildly alkaline pH. This enzyme is evolutionarily related to thementioned seaweed peroxidases, and a recombinant system for producing VCPO is available. Kinetic studies have shown that although the enzyme effectively oxidizes bro-mide (kcat None 100 sNone1) at pH 5 it has a kcat of only 1 sNone1 at the slightly alkaline pH of seawater (pH 8) (22). In this study we obtained a VCPO triple mutant exhibiting 100-fold higher activity at pH 8, as well as an increase in the brominating and chlorinating activity at pH 5 by factors of 6 and 2, respectively. Apart from potential applications of this mutant, the results generatemore fuel to the discussion about the role of various catalytic residues in these enzymes. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression of VCPO in Escherichia coli\u2014We expressed VCPO in a TOP10 E. coli host expression system (Invitrogen) for efficient expres-sion and screening of mutants. The cDNA encoding the VCPO gene was amplified from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression plasmid pTNT14 (22) using the forward primer 5None-CTGAGCTAGCCATAT-GGGGTCCGTTACACCCATCC-3None (NheI site underlined) and the reverse primer 5None-AAGGTACCCTACGGCGCCTCCTTGACTAC-CGG-3None (KpnI site underlined) using Pfu turbo polymerase (Invitro-gen). Following digestion with NheI and KpnI restriction enzymes the DNAwas ligated into pBADgIIIB (Invitrogen) restricted with the same enzymes. This construct includes the gIII signal sequence to facil-itate VCPO secretion into the E. coli periplasm. E. coliTOP10 cells were transformed with the construct pBADVCPO and plated onto LB agar (100 NonegNonemlNone1 ampicillin). Single colonies were tested for expression by checking the phenol red bromination activity at pH 5.0. Optimum expression of VCPOwas obtained by growing cells at 37 \u00b0C to anA600 nm of 0.6\u20130.8, cooling cells to 25 \u00b0C and inducing with 0.02% L-arabinose, and growing for another 20\u201324 h. The expression of VCPO in E. coli yielded an enzyme production of 10 mgNoneliterNone1 culture. The recombi-nant E. coli VCPO showed similar kinetic parameters to the previously recombinant enzyme that was expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae (22), including the pH dependence of the bromide oxidation (pH 4\u20139 (not shown)). Random Mutagenesis, Saturation Mutagenesis, and Site-directed Mutagenesis\u2014The protein sequence space was explored by using the error-prone (ep)PCR (25, 26) as the mutagenesis method, using either the GeneMorphTM I or II kit (Stratagene). epPCRwas performed on 1.3 Kb, thereby leaving out the 0.5 Kb 5None-end that codes for the N-terminal of the enzyme. This region is far removed from the catalytic core and is thought to be involved in the stability of VCPO. The primers used were the forward primer 5None-CCTCAACGATCCTCGAGGTGCTTCGC-3None (XhoI site underlined) and the reverse primer 5None-CCATATGGTAC-CCTACGGCGCCTCCTTGACTACCGG-3None (KpnI site underlined). An average frequency of 1.6 base changes per kilobase was verified by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech AG) of 10 independent colonies. The amplified DNA was subcloned into the XhoI-KpnI digested pBAD-VCPO and transformed back into E. coli TOP10 cells. From an esti-mated library size of 2 None 104, 5000 colonies were robotically picked and FIGURE 1. Minimal scheme of the catalytic cycle of vanadium chloroperoxidase from transferred to the 96-well format and grown in LB to prepare cells for glycerol stocks. For the second generation library, a similar procedure for library construction and preparation was followed, and 8000 colo-nies were screened. Saturationmutagenesis at Pro-395 residue was per-formed using the QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide designs were based on the following set of primers, sense primer 5None-CAACGACATTCCATTCAAGNNNCCTTTCCCAGCTTACCC-3None and antisense primer 5None-GGGTAAGCTGGGAAAGGNNNCTT-GAATGGAATGTCGTTGG-3None using the optimal codon requirement (at positions underlined) for E. coli expression. The QuikChangeTM kit was also used to construct the site-directed control mutants using the oligonucleotides, L241V (sense) 5None-CGCAGAGCGAGCACTTCGTG-GCCGACCCACCGGGCC-3None, L241V(antisense)5None-GGCCCGGTGG-GTCGGCCACGAAGTGCTCGCTCTGCG-3None; T343A (sense) 5None-CGTCGACGTCGCTTGCGCAGACGCTGGTATCTTTTCC-3None, T343A(antisense) 5None-GGAAAAGATACCAGCGTCTGCGCAAGC-GACGTCGACG-3None; R360C (sense) 5None-GGGAGTTCGAATTCTGGT-GCCCACTATCTGGTGTGCG-3None, R360C(antisense) 5None-CGCACAC-CAGATAGTGGGCACCAGAATTCGAACTCCC-3None; A399S (sense) 5None-CCATTCAAGCCTCCTTTCCCATCTTACCCATCTGGTCAC-GCGACC-3None, A399S(antisense) 5None-GGTCGCGTGACCAGATGGG-TAAGATGGGAAAGGAGGCTTGAATGG-3None (codons for amino acid are underlined, and mutagenesis position are in italics). High Throughput Expression of VCPO Mutants\u2014Cell growth and enzyme expression was performed in 2-ml volume, 96-well format polypropylene deep well plates (Greiner Bio-One). Using a 96-pin col-ony replicator, frozen cells were transferred to the deep well plates con-taining 1 ml of liquid LB medium with 100 NonegNoneml None1 ampicillin and 0.02% L-arabinose and covered with Breath Seal porous films (Greiner Bio-One). The cells were grown using an INFORS Microtron plate shaker for 24 h at 25 \u00b0C at 560 rpm. The plates were chilled to 4 \u00b0C and centrifuged at 3500 rpm (Beckmann S5700). The media were removed, the cells were washedwith 50mMTris-SO4, pH 8.3, lysed by resuspend-ing and incubating in 100 Nonel of lysis buffer (50 NonegNonemlNone1 Lysozyme, 40 Kunitz unitsNonemlNone1 DNase, 4 mM MgSO4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 100 mM Tris-SO4, pH 8.0) for 10 min, followed by a freeze-thaw cycle. The suspensions were then transferred to V-bottom microtiter plates and centrifuged as before. The supernatants were removed to fresh flat bot-tom microtiter plates, and aliquots were used for screening assays. High Throughput Assay and Kinetic Analysis of the Most Promising Mutants\u2014For the initial high throughput screening of mutants a phe-nol red-based assay was used (10). This assay exhibits a color change from deep pink to purple (bromphenol blue) upon bromination at pH 8.0. The assay conditions used for the initial screen were 1 mM BrNone (the concentration in seawater (27)), 10 mM H2O2, 100 NoneM vanadate (the enzyme is expressed as an apo-protein), 50 NoneM phenol red, and 100 mM Tris SO4, pH 8.0. The hydrogen peroxide concentration in the initial screen was 10 times higher than that used in a standard VCPO assay to compensate for potential depletion of H2O2 by endogenous catalase in the cell lysates (28, 29). Enzyme dilutions and assays were performed by a Roboseq SE automated liquid handling system (MWG Biotech AG) and rates of phenol red bromination followed by a 96-well plate reader at 590 nm (Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Labtech). Aliquots of enzyme lysates (10 Nonel) were transferred to flat bottom microtiter plates, and a 90-Nonel phenol red solution (100 mM Tris SO4, pH 8.0, 100 NoneM vanadate (sodium salt), 10 mM H2O2, 1 mM KBr, 50 NoneM phenol red) was added, and plates were vortexed at 500 rpm for 10 s. VCPO variants exhibiting increased phenol red bromination in the initial screen were sequenced and also reassayed using 50 NoneM monochlorodimedone (MCD) (2-chloro-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dimedon), a more effective bromide accep-tor (30, 31), to calculate precise turnover numbers. This reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by following the absorbance decrease at 290 nm (NoneNone None 20 mMNone1cmNone1). From these mutants the four most active mutants were grown on a large scale and purified and reassayed with the MCD assay. Enzyme samples were transferred to quartz cuvettes (100mMTris SO4, pH8.0, 100NoneMvanadate (sodium salt), 1mM H2O2, 1 mM BrNone, 50 NoneM MCD). The halogenation rates were followed using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Purification of Enzymes and Mutants\u2014S. cerevisiae VCPO was pro-duced and purified as described before (22). Purification ofE. coliVCPO was similar to the S. cerevisiae VCPO; disruption of the yeast cells by glass beadswas replaced by sonication of theE. coli cells. In addition, the last FPLC step from the S. cerevisiae VCPO purification was omitted because it did not result in further purification of the E. coli VCPO. VBPO from the seaweed A. nodosum was harvested and purified as described before (32). RESULTS E. coli Expression System and Generation of Mutants\u2014For our directed evolution, expression of VCPO in an E. coli host was desirable. Our VCPO was successfully expressed, yielding an enzyme production of 10 mgNoneliterNone1 culture, sufficient for convenient high throughput screening. In the past expression of vanadium haloperoxidases in E. coli was cumbersome and only low levels of protein expression were obtained due to inclusion body formation (0.1\u20130.3 mg/liter culture for VBPO from C. officinalis (23)) and a very low yield for VBPO from C. pilulifera (24). We optimized our system by inducing the cells at 25 \u00b0C, similar to the study of recombinant VBPO fromC. officinalis (23); however our yield of soluble active protein was much higher. For the Corallina VBPOs the more difficult expression is probably because of the fact that they are dodecameric enzymes as opposed to the mono-mericVCPO. For the dimeric VBPO fromA. nodosum expression is also difficult because of the presence of inter-and intramolecular disulfide bonds. Error-prone PCR mutagenesis was then successfully used to create VCPOmutant libraries and DNA sequence analysis revealed 1.1 amino acid changes on average per mutant. Screening of 5 None 103 mutants in round one and 8 None 103 in round two was performed using a phenol red-based assay (1 mM BrNone, pH 8.0) to identify variant enzymes with enhanced bromination activity. Table 1 summarizes the results of two rounds of screening, saturation mutagenesis of hot spot residue Pro-395, and rational recombination of selected mutants. Analysis of Mutants\u2014Ultimately the best mutant generated was the triple mutant P395D/L241V/T343A with a 40-times-increased bromi-nating activity under our screening conditions (1mMBrNone). Fig. 3 depicts the peroxo-intermediate of the enzyme showing that the mutated resi-dues are in close proximity to the VCPO active site residues. Pro-395 showed up as a hot spot in the first generation; a P395T mutant and a P395H/A399S double mutant were found (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows that Pro-395 borders the active site channel and neighbors Phe-397, a resi-due that is believed to be a part of the halide-binding site (19). Mutation of Pro-395 may influence both the electrostatics in the vicinity of Phe-397 (influencing its NoneNone/NoneNone distribution) and the orientation of Phe-397, either directly or via increased backbone flexibility. Ala-399 is also close to Phe-397; however a A399S control mutant only showed a small increase in activity compared with wild type. In addition, a generated P395H mutant had a similar activity as the P395H/A399S mutant, excluding an important role for the A399S mutation. The other mutant from the first generation, R360C/I391V, indicated a second hot spot. An R360A mutant previously generated by site-di-Directed Evolution of Vanadium Chloroperoxidase 9740 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281 \u2022 NUMBER 14 \u2022 APRIL 7, 2006 rectedmutagenesis also exhibited a higher activity at alkaline conditions (22). An R360C control mutant was identical to the R360C/I391V var-iant (not shown), excluding an important role for the I391V mutation. Arg-360 has an important role in binding the vanadate cofactor, and, interestingly, also stabilizes the position of Phe-397 by forming a hydro-gen bond to its carbonyl group, as shown in Fig. 5. In fact, the crystal structure of R360A mutant shows that the torsion angle of the Phe-397 ring changes as a result of the mutation (34). Thus both mutated resi-dues from the first round of screening (Pro-395 andArg-360)may influ-ence the position or orientation of Phe-397. This residue was previously suggested to support halide binding via its NoneNone ring edge (Fig. 2, left panel), as also observed in haloalkane dehalogenases (35). In this respect it is interesting to note that in our final mutant a higher bromide con-centration is required than in the wild type to reach a maximal activity (Table 2). Unfortunately, the R360C/I391Vmutant inactivates during turnover (as was also previously observed for the R360A mutant (22)), possibly because of loss of cofactor during turnover, eliminating application of this mutation. Therefore a Pro-395 mutant (P395T) was chosen as the starting point for a second round of epPCR. Simultaneously, the Pro-395 position was investigated by saturation mutagenesis of this residue. From the 19 Pro-395 saturationmutants constructed, P395D and P395E were most active, both exhibiting a 10-fold higher activity than wild type. This result suggests that introducing a negative charge at this position leads to a higher activity at pH 8, possibly by influencing pKa values and/or the position of essential catalytic groups. The second round of epPCR (Table 1) generated twomutants with further increases in activity, P395T/L241V (19-fold) and P395T/T343A (14-fold). A site-directed mutant carrying only the L241V mutation showed a 7-fold enhancement as compared with the wild-type enzyme, whereas a T343A single mutant showed a 4-fold increase, indicating that these mutations are synergistic with the P395T mutation. In the x-ray struc-ture of the native enzyme (13) Leu-241 is found in van derWaals contact with Glu-352, a residue next to the catalytically crucial Lys-353 (Fig. 3). This lysine forms a strong hydrogen bond (2.67 \u00c5) to one of the peroxo-oxygen atoms of the peroxo-intermediate, and it is generally believed that this hydrogen bond induces bond polarization necessary for het-erolytic cleavage of the side-on-bound peroxide. Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies have confirmed that this residue is crucial for activ-ity (22). Fig. 3 shows that Thr-343 is reasonably close to the vanadate cofactor; however the rationale behind the effect of theT343Amutation is not clear. After the second round and the saturation mutagenesis, a combina-torial study was carried out in which the interesting mutations were recombined. The purified mutants P395T/L241V/T343A and P395D/ L241V/T343A showed a 20-and 40-fold enhancement, respectively. Kinetic Characterization of the Mutant P395D/L241V/T343A\u2014We performed a more detailed kinetic study of the best mutant (P395D/ L241V/T343A) (Table 2) and compared it with VBPO fromA. nodosum that naturally evolved at pH 8 and 1 mM BrNone. Our results show that by increasing the BrNone concentration the brominating activity can be fur-ther increased. At 100 mM BrNone the activity is 2.5-fold higher than the same mutant at 1 mM BrNone and thus 100-fold higher than wild-type VCPO. This further increase in activity going from 1 to 100 mM BrNone is caused by the fact that 1mMBrNone does not representVmax conditions for FIGURE 3. Crystal structure of the catalytic peroxo-intermediate of vanadium chloroperoxidase (PDB code 1IDU), showing the cofactor environment including the residues the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant (Km None 3.1 mM, Table 2), whereas for the wild-type it does (Km None 0.12 mM, Table 2). This Km value for BrNone is still smaller than that ofVBPO fromA. nodosum (16mM). The large gain in activity has partially occurred at the expense of the very lowKm value, so the effect in terms of Vmax/Km is modest (factor 4). Our assay in the high throughput screening was carried out in the presence of 100 NoneM vanadate, and therefore formation of a mutant with a decreased affinity for vanadatemay have gone unnoticed. However, reactivation studies of the apo-mutant in seawater (concentration vanadate in seawater None50 nM) (37) showed that it rapidly and completely reactivated (not shown). Our initial high throughput screening at 10 mM H2O2 also harbors the potential danger that the high affinity of the wild-type enzyme for this substrate (None5 NoneM) is lost uponmutation. Although a Km value of 16 NoneM for the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant represents a slight increase, it is still small and of similar magnitude as for VBPO from A. nodosum (22 NoneM). All together, at 1 mM BrNone the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant is maximally 40 timesmore active thenwild-type VCPO and 8 timesmore active than VBPO from A. nodosum. In addition to the results obtained at pH 8, the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant was investigated at pH 5 (Table 2). The brominating activity of thismutant at pH 5 is increasedNone6-fold to a kcat of 575 sNone1, which is one of the highest values for BrNone turnover reported for a vanadium haloper-oxidase. The chlorinating activity of the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant is None2-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme, thereby making this the best chlorinating vanadium haloperoxidase (21, 22). DISCUSSION Two important issues on vanadium haloperoxidases that remain unsolved are their halide specificity and the factors that govern their pH profiles. Some insight into the halide specificity has been obtained from site-directed mutagenesis studies (22) and by comparison of crystal structures (17, 19) identifying Phe-397 and Trp-350 and the corre-sponding residues in VBPOs as putative halide-binding residues. In VBPOs a histidine residue is found on the position of Phe-397, whereas in Corallina VBPOs an arginine is found in the position of Trp-350. However, a clear hypothesis on the origin and differences of the pH profiles of these enzymes is lacking. Because there is an intricate inter-play of hydrogen bonds and charges in the active site, rational changes of the pH profile and halide-binding characteristics by site-directed mutagenesis are difficult to predict. Therefore, we used directed evolu-tion as the approach to obtain variants with enhanced activity at high pH. We chose screening conditions of 1 mM BrNone and pH 8, to ensure retention of sufficient affinity for bromide and to resemble seawater conditions. As outlined under \u201cResults\u201d the two hot spots from the first generation of directed evolution mutants, Pro-395 and Arg-360, both point toward tuning of Phe-397. Both the Pro-395 andArg-360mutants as well as our final mutant require a higher bromide concentration than the wild-type VCPO to reach amaximal activity, in line with the halide-binding site being affected. These results are also in line with studies on VBPO from A. nodosum (Table 2) that has a histidine (His-411) in the position corresponding to Phe-397 as illustrated in Fig. 2. Like our mutants, VBPO needs a higher bromide concentration than VCPO to reach maximal turnover. In addition it was previously shown that a F397H mutation in VCPO affected the affinity for the halide, as the Km values for ClNone and BrNone were increased None10-fold (38). All these obser-FIGURE 4. View of the active site channel of VCPO showing the position of Pro-395, vations support the hypothesis that tuning Phe-397 is crucial for the activity of VCPO. In addition to the identity and the position of this residue, the charge effects on Phe-397 may be crucial; mutagenesis of Pro-395 that is next to Phe-397 (Fig. 4) has the largest effect if a negative charge is introduced. Introducing a negative charge at the Pro-395 posi-tion may also have repelling effect on the halide, in agreement with the observed demand for a higher halide concentration. It is interesting to note that Lys-353 is located close to Phe-397; recently it was suggested that the polarization effect of the corresponding lysine inVBPO is tuned by a hydrogen bond to His-411 (15), the residue that corresponds to Phe-397 inVCPO (Fig. 2). Because VBPO ismore active at high pH than VCPO this is in linewith our explanation thatmutations influencing the position of Lys-353 in VCPO are responsible for changes in enzymatic activity. In addition to tuning the position and electrostatics in the vicinity of Phe-397 the altered activity observed in the Pro-395 and Arg-360 mutants can be explained by a change in the electron density on the vanadate oxygens. Fig. 6 shows that both Pro-395 and Arg-360 are in close contact with vanadate oxygen-1. Introducing a negative charge at Pro-395 or the removal of the positive charge of Arg-360 will influence the charge on the vanadate oxygens including oxygen-2 that is believed to be transferred to the halide during catalysis. This idea is supported by a previous observation (22) describing an R490A mutant of VCPO that also exhibited a similar increased activity at high pH; Fig. 6 shows that also Arg-490 is in close contact with vanadate oxygen-1. Influencing vanadate oxygen-1will affect the entire cofactor, which thenmay lead to pKa changes of crucial groups in catalysis, e.g. that of vanadate oxygen-2. This may partially account for the observed higher activity at pH 8. The increased electron density on vanadate oxygenmay also attribute to the observed demand for a higher halide concentration to reach maximal turnover rates. Similar arguments can be used for the tuning effect of Lys-353 as described under \u201cResults.\u201d All of the effects described above may strengthen each other concertedly. Previously, x-ray structures of five active site mutant VCPOs and the apo-form of the enzyme were determined, showing no changes in the secondary structure. These investigations have shown that the secondary structure of VCPO is very rigid, strongly decreasing the likelihood of large changes in the P395D/ L241V/T343Amutant. Our error-prone PCR strategy was designed for maximal retention of protein stability, as we did not subject the struc-turally important N-terminal residues to mutagenesis. Moreover, we have shown that the cofactor vanadate is still strongly bound in this mutant, also suggesting correct folding. X-ray structure determination of themutant will have to identify subtle changes and showwhether our interpretations of the kinetic results are correct. At 1 mM BrNone and pH 8 the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant shows a much higher activity than both the wild-type VCPO and VBPO from A. nodosum, making this mutant a good candidate for antifouling appli-cations in seawater. In disinfection and synthetic applications higher concentrations of BrNone may be used, thereby employing the maximal turnover of themutant. As an example of the latter, we intend to couple alkaline halogenation of aromatic compounds by the mutant to a palla-dium-catalyzed Heck reaction (39, 40), which only occurs effectively at alkaline pH. In this manner the halide is recycled thus leading to elimi-nation of salt waste. Our work may raise the question of why these simple variants were not made by the natural organisms themselves, because it is believed that the formation of hypohalous acids is the natural role of these enzymes. The most obvious answer to this is that as a starting point for our directed evolution study the vanadium chloroperoxidase from the fungusC. inaequaliswas taken. This terrestrial organism belongs to the group of dematiaceous hyphomyctes that normally grow on plants and are plant parasites; in the natural habitat of the fungus the enzyme will probably meet neutral to slightly acidic conditions. In addition to this pH effect, the bromide concentration of the fungal habitat is much lower than the concentration used in our screening (1 mM), reflected by the very high affinity of the wild-type vanadium chloroperoxidase for bromide (Km None 5NoneM). For the VBPOs found in seaweeds the situation is different. These enzymes have evolved at 1 mM bromide and pH 8, and therefore it is not surprising that the activity of VBPO fromA. nodosum is closer to the laboratory-evolved VCPO mutant (P395D/L241V/ T343A), although a factor of 8 difference still remains to be explained. Examining the three mutation sites found in the VCPO mutant reveals that only the Pro-395 is found in a region that is conserved in the vana-dium bromoperoxidases. From the crystal structures available for the vanadium bromoperoxidases we cannot give an answer as to whymuta-tion of the proline of vanadiumbromoperoxidase corresponding to Pro-395 in vanadium chloroperoxidase has not occurred in vivo. Site-di-rectedmutagenesis of this residue in a vanadium bromoperoxidasemay answer this question. In summary we show the first example of directed evolution of a vanadium enzyme, increasing its turnover number maximally 100-fold at mildly alkaline pH. The changed halogenating activity may be explained by (i) a change in the electron density on the oxygens of the vanadate cofactor, in particular vanadate oxygen-2 of the peroxo-intermediate and (ii) an alteration of the electrostatics in the vicinity of the halide-binding residue Phe-397 and a change of its position. Our control mutants suggest that these effects are synergistic, a typ-ical outcome of a directed evolution study. To further understand the higher brominating and chlorinating activities of the P395D/ L241V/T343A mutant, high-resolution crystallographic studies on this mutant and especially its peroxo-intermediate are desirable. Based on the successful application of directed evolution of VCPO presented here, we also intend to generate novel VCPO activities such as enantiomeric sulfoxidation and epoxidation.

        "Directed evolution was performed on vanadium chloroperoxi-dase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis to increase its bromi-nating activity at a mildly alkaline pH for industrial and synthetic applications and to further understand its mechanism. After suc-cessful expression of the enzyme in Escherichia coli, two rounds of screening and selection, saturationmutagenesis of a \u201chot spot,\u201d and rational recombination, a triple mutant (P395D/L241V/T343A) was obtained that showed a 100-fold increase in activity at pH 8 (kcat None 100 sNone1). The increased Km values for BrNone (3.1 mM) and H2O2 (16NoneM) are smaller than those found for vanadiumbromoper-oxidases that are reasonably active at this pH. In addition the bro-minating activity at pH 5 was increased by a factor of 6 (kcat None 575 sNone1), and the chlorinating activity at pH 5 was increased by a factor of 2 (kcat None 36 sNone1), yielding the \u201cbest\u201d vanadium haloper-oxidase known thus far. The mutations are in the first and second coordination sphere of the vanadate cofactor, and the catalytic effects suggest that fine tuning of residues Lys-353 and Phe-397, alongwith addition of negative charge or removal of positive charge near one of the vanadate oxygens, is very important. Lys-353 and Phe-397were previously assigned to be essential in peroxide activa-tion and halide binding. Analysis of the catalytic parameters of the mutant vanadium bromoperoxidase from the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum also adds fuel to the discussion regarding factors governing thehalidespecificityofvanadiumhaloperoxidases.This studypresents the first example of directed evolution of a vanadium enzyme.",
        "Haloperoxidases catalyze the oxidation of halides to hypohalous acids (see Equation 1), an industrially interesting reaction; these enzymes can be used to halogenate various organic compounds (1, 2) (see Equation 2). In addition they may provide an alternative biocide in antifouling applications (3\u20135) or may be used as a component in disinfectants and in detergent formulations for bleaching purposes (6\u20138). Equations 1 and 2 illustrate the reactions occuring.",

        "Presently two classes of enzymes are known that efficiently catalyze the oxidation of a halide by hydrogen peroxide, the vanadium haloper-oxidases and the heme peroxidases. The heme peroxidases have a sig-nificant disadvantage of rapid inactivation during turnover because of an oxidative reaction of the heme groupwith the peroxide substrate and the formed hypohalous acids. Vanadium haloperoxidases (VHPOs),2 which contain vanadate (VO43None) as a prosthetic group, do not suffer from this disadvantage (9); in addition they are much more resistant toward heat, detergent, and solvent denaturation (10). Themajor draw-back of all haloperoxidases including the stable VHPOs is that they are mainly active at mildly acidic pH values, whereas for many applications activity at mildly alkaline pH values is required. An example of this is their potential use as an antifouling agent in marine paints (3\u20135), an application inspired by their putative role in vivo.Many brown seaweeds contain vanadium haloperoxidases that are present on the plant surface (11), and apart from the direct antimicrobial activity ofHOBr andHOCl it was demonstrated that these hypohalous acids react rapidly with homoserine lactone derivatives produced by bacteria as communica-tion signals (quorum sensing) thus preventing biofilm formation on the surface of these seaweeds (12). Current antifouling technologies are often very environmentally unfriendly, but still being used because of the absence of good alternatives.",
        "Crystal structures of VHPOs have shown peculiar vanadium chem-istry: the enzymes shuttle between a trigonal bipyramidal structure (native) and a distorted tetragonal structure (peroxo-intermediate) (see Fig. 1). Despite considerable additional data (kinetic, genetic, muta-tional, and spectroscopic) onVHPOs fromdifferent organisms (16\u201318), several questions about these enzymes remain to be answered. Espe-cially the factors governing the halide specificity and pH optima are not fully understood. Fig. 2 shows a picture emerging from three previously published proposals (14, 15, 19) on the differences between vanadium chloroperoxidases (VCPOs) and vanadium bromoperoxidases (VBPOs). It was suggested that binding of the halide in VCPO is assisted by residues Phe-397 and Trp-350 via their NoneNone ring edge (19). The VBPOs have a histidine in the position corresponding to Phe-397 and the VBPOs from the marine algae Corallina officinalis and Corallina pilulifera have an arginine in the position of Trp-350 (17), thereby sug-gesting that differences in specificity may be partially explained by amino acid variations at these two positions. In addition to differences in direct binding of the halide, it was suggested that in the VBPO from the seaweedAscophyllumnodosum the bound peroxide is deprotonated by His-411 (Fig. 2), thereby reducing the oxidative strength of these enzymes and their affinity for the halide (14). The assigned full positive charge on the protonated peroxide oxygen in VCPOwas also suggested",

        "to give rise to the very strong uncompetitive inhibition by azide seen in VCPO, being absent in wild-type VBPOs (20). A VBPOmutant from C. pilulifera that essentially has become a VCPO was also strongly inhib-ited by azide (21). The His-411 of VBPO from A. nodosum also forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytically important Lys-341, and it was suggested that this decreases the polarizing effect of this histidine on the bound peroxide (15). A clear explanation for the pH profiles in these enzymes is lacking, but interestingly, the optima of the VBPOs are shifted to more neutral pH values (5.5\u20136.0) as compared with the VCPOs (pH 4.5\u20135.0). Attempts to rationally modify the properties of these enzymes by site-directed mutagenesis have only met limited suc-cess. Two variants ofVCPO from the fungusCurvularia inaequaliswith a reduced positive charge near the vanadate cofactor (R360A and R490A) showed higher brominating activity at alkaline pH; however these mutants inactivated during turnover and lost most of their ability to oxidize chloride (22). The most successful attempt to date has been a site-directedmutagenesis study in which substantial chlorinating activ-ity (40 sNone1) was introduced in a VBPO from the marine algae C. pilulif-era (mutants R397W and R397F); however the reported Km values for ClNone of two mutants were very high (None700 mM) (22).",
        "In this study we have used directed evolution techniques to improve the activity of VCPO from C. inaequalis at mildly alkaline pH. This enzyme is evolutionarily related to thementioned seaweed peroxidases, and a recombinant system for producing VCPO is available. Kinetic studies have shown that although the enzyme effectively oxidizes bro-mide (kcat None 100 sNone1) at pH 5 it has a kcat of only 1 sNone1 at the slightly alkaline pH of seawater (pH 8) (22). In this study we obtained a VCPO triple mutant exhibiting 100-fold higher activity at pH 8, as well as an increase in the brominating and chlorinating activity at pH 5 by factors of 6 and 2, respectively. Apart from potential applications of this mutant, the results generatemore fuel to the discussion about the role of various catalytic residues in these enzymes.",

        "Expression of VCPO in Escherichia coli\u2014We expressed VCPO in a TOP10 E. coli host expression system (Invitrogen) for efficient expres-sion and screening of mutants.

Following digestion with NheI and KpnI restriction enzymes the DNAwas ligated into pBADgIIIB (Invitrogen) restricted with the same enzymes. This construct includes the gIII signal sequence to facil-itate VCPO secretion into the E. coli periplasm. E. coliTOP10 cells were transformed with the construct pBADVCPO and plated onto LB agar (100 NonegNonemlNone1 ampicillin). Single colonies were tested for expression by checking the phenol red bromination activity at pH 5.0. Optimum expression of VCPOwas obtained by growing cells at 37 \u00b0C to anA600 nm of 0.6\u20130.8, cooling cells to 25 \u00b0C and inducing with 0.02% L-arabinose, and growing for another 20\u201324 h. The expression of VCPO in E. coli yielded an enzyme production of 10 mgNoneliterNone1 culture. The recombi-nant E. coli VCPO showed similar kinetic parameters to the previously recombinant enzyme that was expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae (22), including the pH dependence of the bromide oxidation (pH 4\u20139 (not shown)).",
        "Random Mutagenesis, Saturation Mutagenesis, and Site-directed Mutagenesis\u2014The protein sequence space was explored by using the error-prone (ep)PCR (25, 26) as the mutagenesis method, using either the GeneMorphTM I or II kit (Stratagene). epPCRwas performed on 1.3 Kb, thereby leaving out the 0.5 Kb 5None-end that codes for the N-terminal of the enzyme.

The hydrogen peroxide concentration in the initial screen was 10 times higher than that used in a standard VCPO assay to compensate for potential depletion of H2O2 by endogenous catalase in the cell lysates (28, 29). Enzyme dilutions and assays were performed by a Roboseq SE automated liquid handling system (MWG Biotech AG) and rates of phenol red bromination followed by a 96-well plate reader at 590 nm (Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Labtech). Aliquots of enzyme lysates (10 Nonel) were transferred to flat bottom microtiter plates, and a 90-Nonel phenol red solution (100 mM Tris SO4, pH 8.0, 100 NoneM vanadate (sodium salt), 10 mM H2O2, 1 mM KBr, 50 NoneM phenol red) was added, and plates were vortexed at 500 rpm for 10 s. VCPO variants exhibiting increased phenol red bromination in the initial screen were sequenced and also reassayed using 50 NoneM monochlorodimedone (MCD) (2-chloro-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dimedon), a more effective bromide accep-tor (30, 31), to calculate precise turnover numbers. This reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by following the absorbance decrease at 290 nm (NoneNone None 20 mMNone1cmNone1). From these mutants the four most active mutants were grown on a large scale and purified and reassayed with the MCD assay. Enzyme samples were transferred to quartz cuvettes (100mMTris SO4, pH8.0, 100NoneMvanadate (sodium salt), 1mM H2O2, 1 mM BrNone, 50 NoneM MCD). The halogenation rates were followed using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer.",
        "Purification of Enzymes and Mutants\u2014S. cerevisiae VCPO was pro-duced and purified as described before (22). Purification ofE. coliVCPO was similar to the S. cerevisiae VCPO; disruption of the yeast cells by glass beadswas replaced by sonication of theE. coli cells. In addition, the last FPLC step from the S. cerevisiae VCPO purification was omitted because it did not result in further purification of the E. coli VCPO. VBPO from the seaweed A. nodosum was harvested and purified as described before (32).",
        "RESULTS",
        "E. coli Expression System and Generation of Mutants\u2014For our directed evolution, expression of VCPO in an E. coli host was desirable. Our VCPO was successfully expressed, yielding an enzyme production of 10 mgNoneliterNone1 culture, sufficient for convenient high throughput screening. In the past expression of vanadium haloperoxidases in E. coli was cumbersome and only low levels of protein expression were obtained due to inclusion body formation (0.1\u20130.3 mg/liter culture for VBPO from C. officinalis (23)) and a very low yield for VBPO from C. pilulifera (24). We optimized our system by inducing the cells at 25 \u00b0C, similar to the study of recombinant VBPO fromC. officinalis (23); however our yield of soluble active protein was much higher. For the Corallina VBPOs the more difficult expression is probably because of the fact that they are dodecameric enzymes as opposed to the mono-mericVCPO. For the dimeric VBPO fromA. nodosum expression is also difficult because of the presence of inter-and intramolecular disulfide bonds.",
        "Error-prone PCR mutagenesis was then successfully used to create VCPOmutant libraries and DNA sequence analysis revealed 1.1 amino acid changes on average per mutant. Screening of 5 None 103 mutants in round one and 8 None 103 in round two was performed using a phenol red-based assay (1 mM BrNone, pH 8.0) to identify variant enzymes with enhanced bromination activity. Table 1 summarizes the results of two rounds of screening, saturation mutagenesis of hot spot residue Pro-395, and rational recombination of selected mutants.",
        "Analysis of Mutants\u2014Ultimately the best mutant generated was the triple mutant P395D/L241V/T343A with a 40-times-increased bromi-nating activity under our screening conditions (1mMBrNone). Fig. 3 depicts the peroxo-intermediate of the enzyme showing that the mutated resi-dues are in close proximity to the VCPO active site residues. Pro-395 showed up as a hot spot in the first generation; a P395T mutant and a P395H/A399S double mutant were found (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows that Pro-395 borders the active site channel and neighbors Phe-397, a resi-due that is believed to be a part of the halide-binding site (19). Mutation of Pro-395 may influence both the electrostatics in the vicinity of Phe-397 (influencing its NoneNone/NoneNone distribution) and the orientation of Phe-397, either directly or via increased backbone flexibility. Ala-399 is also close to Phe-397; however a A399S control mutant only showed a small increase in activity compared with wild type. In addition, a generated P395H mutant had a similar activity as the P395H/A399S mutant, excluding an important role for the A399S mutation.",

        "rectedmutagenesis also exhibited a higher activity at alkaline conditions (22). An R360C control mutant was identical to the R360C/I391V var-iant (not shown), excluding an important role for the I391V mutation. Arg-360 has an important role in binding the vanadate cofactor, and, interestingly, also stabilizes the position of Phe-397 by forming a hydro-gen bond to its carbonyl group, as shown in Fig. 5. In fact, the crystal structure of R360A mutant shows that the torsion angle of the Phe-397 ring changes as a result of the mutation (34). Thus both mutated resi-dues from the first round of screening (Pro-395 andArg-360)may influ-ence the position or orientation of Phe-397. This residue was previously suggested to support halide binding via its NoneNone ring edge (Fig. 2, left panel), as also observed in haloalkane dehalogenases (35). In this respect it is interesting to note that in our final mutant a higher bromide con-centration is required than in the wild type to reach a maximal activity (Table 2).",
        "Unfortunately, the R360C/I391Vmutant inactivates during turnover (as was also previously observed for the R360A mutant (22)), possibly because of loss of cofactor during turnover, eliminating application of this mutation. Therefore a Pro-395 mutant (P395T) was chosen as the starting point for a second round of epPCR. Simultaneously, the Pro-395 position was investigated by saturation mutagenesis of this residue. From the 19 Pro-395 saturationmutants constructed, P395D and P395E were most active, both exhibiting a 10-fold higher activity than wild type. This result suggests that introducing a negative charge at this position leads to a higher activity at pH 8, possibly by influencing pKa values and/or the position of essential catalytic groups. The second round of epPCR (Table 1) generated twomutants with further increases in activity, P395T/L241V (19-fold) and P395T/T343A (14-fold). A site-directed mutant carrying only the L241V mutation showed a 7-fold enhancement as compared with the wild-type enzyme, whereas a T343A single mutant showed a 4-fold increase, indicating that these mutations are synergistic with the P395T mutation. In the x-ray struc-ture of the native enzyme (13) Leu-241 is found in van derWaals contact with Glu-352, a residue next to the catalytically crucial Lys-353 (Fig. 3). This lysine forms a strong hydrogen bond (2.67 \u00c5) to one of the peroxo-oxygen atoms of the peroxo-intermediate, and it is generally believed that this hydrogen bond induces bond polarization necessary for het-erolytic cleavage of the side-on-bound peroxide. Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies have confirmed that this residue is crucial for activ-ity (22). Fig. 3 shows that Thr-343 is reasonably close to the vanadate cofactor; however the rationale behind the effect of theT343Amutation is not clear.",
        "After the second round and the saturation mutagenesis, a combina-torial study was carried out in which the interesting mutations were recombined. The purified mutants P395T/L241V/T343A and P395D/ L241V/T343A showed a 20-and 40-fold enhancement, respectively.",
        "Kinetic Characterization of the Mutant P395D/L241V/T343A\u2014We performed a more detailed kinetic study of the best mutant (P395D/ L241V/T343A) (Table 2) and compared it with VBPO fromA. nodosum that naturally evolved at pH 8 and 1 mM BrNone. Our results show that by increasing the BrNone concentration the brominating activity can be fur-ther increased. At 100 mM BrNone the activity is 2.5-fold higher than the same mutant at 1 mM BrNone and thus 100-fold higher than wild-type VCPO. This further increase in activity going from 1 to 100 mM BrNone is caused by the fact that 1mMBrNone does not representVmax conditions for",
        "FIGURE 3. Crystal structure of the catalytic peroxo-intermediate of vanadium chloroperoxidase (PDB code 1IDU), showing the cofactor environment including the residues",
        "the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant (Km None 3.1 mM, Table 2), whereas for the wild-type it does (Km None 0.12 mM, Table 2). This Km value for BrNone is still smaller than that ofVBPO fromA. nodosum (16mM). The large gain in activity has partially occurred at the expense of the very lowKm value, so the effect in terms of Vmax/Km is modest (factor 4). Our assay in the high throughput screening was carried out in the presence of 100 NoneM vanadate, and therefore formation of a mutant with a decreased affinity for vanadatemay have gone unnoticed. However, reactivation studies of the apo-mutant in seawater (concentration vanadate in seawater None50 nM) (37) showed that it rapidly and completely reactivated (not shown). Our initial high throughput screening at 10 mM H2O2 also harbors the potential danger that the high affinity of the wild-type enzyme for this substrate (None5 NoneM) is lost uponmutation. Although a Km value of 16 NoneM for the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant represents a slight increase, it is still small and of similar magnitude as for VBPO from A. nodosum (22 NoneM). All together, at 1 mM BrNone the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant is maximally 40 timesmore active thenwild-type VCPO and 8 timesmore active than VBPO from A. nodosum.",
        "In addition to the results obtained at pH 8, the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant was investigated at pH 5 (Table 2). The brominating activity of thismutant at pH 5 is increasedNone6-fold to a kcat of 575 sNone1, which is one of the highest values for BrNone turnover reported for a vanadium haloper-oxidase. The chlorinating activity of the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant is None2-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme, thereby making this the best chlorinating vanadium haloperoxidase (21, 22).",
        "DISCUSSION",
        "Two important issues on vanadium haloperoxidases that remain unsolved are their halide specificity and the factors that govern their pH profiles. Some insight into the halide specificity has been obtained from site-directed mutagenesis studies (22) and by comparison of crystal structures (17, 19) identifying Phe-397 and Trp-350 and the corre-sponding residues in VBPOs as putative halide-binding residues. In VBPOs a histidine residue is found on the position of Phe-397, whereas in Corallina VBPOs an arginine is found in the position of Trp-350. However, a clear hypothesis on the origin and differences of the pH profiles of these enzymes is lacking. Because there is an intricate inter-play of hydrogen bonds and charges in the active site, rational changes of the pH profile and halide-binding characteristics by site-directed mutagenesis are difficult to predict. Therefore, we used directed evolu-tion as the approach to obtain variants with enhanced activity at high pH. We chose screening conditions of 1 mM BrNone and pH 8, to ensure retention of sufficient affinity for bromide and to resemble seawater conditions. As outlined under \u201cResults\u201d the two hot spots from the first generation of directed evolution mutants, Pro-395 and Arg-360, both point toward tuning of Phe-397. Both the Pro-395 andArg-360mutants as well as our final mutant require a higher bromide concentration than the wild-type VCPO to reach amaximal activity, in line with the halide-binding site being affected. These results are also in line with studies on VBPO from A. nodosum (Table 2) that has a histidine (His-411) in the position corresponding to Phe-397 as illustrated in Fig. 2. Like our mutants, VBPO needs a higher bromide concentration than VCPO to reach maximal turnover. In addition it was previously shown that a F397H mutation in VCPO affected the affinity for the halide, as the Km values for ClNone and BrNone were increased None10-fold (38). All these obser-",
        "FIGURE 4. View of the active site channel of VCPO showing the position of Pro-395,",
        "vations support the hypothesis that tuning Phe-397 is crucial for the activity of VCPO. In addition to the identity and the position of this residue, the charge effects on Phe-397 may be crucial; mutagenesis of Pro-395 that is next to Phe-397 (Fig. 4) has the largest effect if a negative charge is introduced. Introducing a negative charge at the Pro-395 posi-tion may also have repelling effect on the halide, in agreement with the observed demand for a higher halide concentration. It is interesting to note that Lys-353 is located close to Phe-397; recently it was suggested that the polarization effect of the corresponding lysine inVBPO is tuned by a hydrogen bond to His-411 (15), the residue that corresponds to Phe-397 inVCPO (Fig. 2). Because VBPO ismore active at high pH than VCPO this is in linewith our explanation thatmutations influencing the position of Lys-353 in VCPO are responsible for changes in enzymatic activity.",
        "In addition to tuning the position and electrostatics in the vicinity of Phe-397 the altered activity observed in the Pro-395 and Arg-360 mutants can be explained by a change in the electron density on the vanadate oxygens. Fig. 6 shows that both Pro-395 and Arg-360 are in close contact with vanadate oxygen-1. Introducing a negative charge at Pro-395 or the removal of the positive charge of Arg-360 will influence the charge on the vanadate oxygens including oxygen-2 that is believed to be transferred to the halide during catalysis. This idea is supported by a previous observation (22) describing an R490A mutant of VCPO that also exhibited a similar increased activity at high pH; Fig. 6 shows that also Arg-490 is in close contact with vanadate oxygen-1. Influencing vanadate oxygen-1will affect the entire cofactor, which thenmay lead to pKa changes of crucial groups in catalysis, e.g. that of vanadate oxygen-2. This may partially account for the observed higher activity at pH 8. The increased electron density on vanadate oxygenmay also attribute to the observed demand for a higher halide concentration to reach maximal turnover rates. Similar arguments can be used for the tuning effect of Lys-353 as described under \u201cResults.\u201d All of the effects described above may strengthen each other concertedly. Previously, x-ray structures of five active site mutant VCPOs and the apo-form of the enzyme were determined, showing no changes in the secondary structure. These investigations have shown that the secondary structure of VCPO is very rigid, strongly decreasing the likelihood of large changes in the P395D/ L241V/T343Amutant. Our error-prone PCR strategy was designed for maximal retention of protein stability, as we did not subject the struc-turally important N-terminal residues to mutagenesis. Moreover, we have shown that the cofactor vanadate is still strongly bound in this mutant, also suggesting correct folding. X-ray structure determination of themutant will have to identify subtle changes and showwhether our interpretations of the kinetic results are correct.",
        "At 1 mM BrNone and pH 8 the P395D/L241V/T343A mutant shows a much higher activity than both the wild-type VCPO and VBPO from A. nodosum, making this mutant a good candidate for antifouling appli-cations in seawater. In disinfection and synthetic applications higher concentrations of BrNone may be used, thereby employing the maximal turnover of themutant. As an example of the latter, we intend to couple alkaline halogenation of aromatic compounds by the mutant to a palla-dium-catalyzed Heck reaction (39, 40), which only occurs effectively at alkaline pH. In this manner the halide is recycled thus leading to elimi-nation of salt waste.",
        "Our work may raise the question of why these simple variants were not made by the natural organisms themselves, because it is believed that the formation of hypohalous acids is the natural role of these enzymes. The most obvious answer to this is that as a starting point for our directed evolution study the vanadium chloroperoxidase from the fungusC. inaequaliswas taken. This terrestrial organism belongs to the group of dematiaceous hyphomyctes that normally grow on plants and are plant parasites; in the natural habitat of the fungus the enzyme will probably meet neutral to slightly acidic conditions. In addition to this pH effect, the bromide concentration of the fungal habitat is much lower than the concentration used in our screening (1 mM), reflected by the very high affinity of the wild-type vanadium chloroperoxidase for bromide (Km None 5NoneM). For the VBPOs found in seaweeds the situation is different. These enzymes have evolved at 1 mM bromide and pH 8, and therefore it is not surprising that the activity of VBPO fromA. nodosum is closer to the laboratory-evolved VCPO mutant (P395D/L241V/ T343A), although a factor of 8 difference still remains to be explained. Examining the three mutation sites found in the VCPO mutant reveals that only the Pro-395 is found in a region that is conserved in the vana-dium bromoperoxidases. From the crystal structures available for the vanadium bromoperoxidases we cannot give an answer as to whymuta-tion of the proline of vanadiumbromoperoxidase corresponding to Pro-395 in vanadium chloroperoxidase has not occurred in vivo. Site-di-rectedmutagenesis of this residue in a vanadium bromoperoxidasemay answer this question.",
        "In summary we show the first example of directed evolution of a vanadium enzyme, increasing its turnover number maximally 100-fold at mildly alkaline pH. The changed halogenating activity may be explained by (i) a change in the electron density on the oxygens of the vanadate cofactor, in particular vanadate oxygen-2 of the peroxo-intermediate and (ii) an alteration of the electrostatics in the vicinity of the halide-binding residue Phe-397 and a change of its position. Our control mutants suggest that these effects are synergistic, a typ-ical outcome of a directed evolution study. To further understand the higher brominating and chlorinating activities of the P395D/ L241V/T343A mutant, high-resolution crystallographic studies on this mutant and especially its peroxo-intermediate are desirable. Based on the successful application of directed evolution of VCPO presented here, we also intend to generate novel VCPO activities such as enantiomeric sulfoxidation and epoxidation.",
