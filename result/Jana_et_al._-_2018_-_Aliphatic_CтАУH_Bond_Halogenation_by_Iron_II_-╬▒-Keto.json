C. Mullick Road, Jadavpur, Kolkata 700032, India *S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: \u03b1-Ketoglutarate-dependent nonheme halo-genases catalyze the halogenation of aliphatic C-H bonds in the biosynthesis pathway of many natural products. An iron(IV)-oxo-halo species has been established as the active oxidant in the halogenation reactions. With an objective to emulate the function of the nonheme halogenases, two iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes, [(phdpa)Fe(BF)Cl] (1) and [(1,4-tpbd)Fe2(BF)2Cl2] (2) (where phdpa = N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aniline, 1,4-tpbd = N,N,N\u2032,N\u2019-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)benzene-1,4-diamine, and BF = benzoylfor-mate), have been prepared. The iron complexes are capable of carrying out the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic C-H bonds using O2 as the terminal oxidant. Although the complexes are not selective toward C-H bond halogenation, they are the only examples of nonheme iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes mimicking the activity of nonheme halogenases. The dinuclear complex (2) exhibits enhanced reactivity toward C-H bond halogenation/hydroxylation.  INTRODUCTION The halogenation of aliphatic C-H bonds is a unique chemical reaction in biology. Biosyntheses of a large variety of natural products involve the halogenation of unactivated C-H bonds at aliphatic carbon centers. In the biosynthetic processes, \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG)-dependent nonheme iron halogenases activate O2 to halogenate aliphatic C-H bonds of substrates.1 CytC3 and SyrB2 are examples of this group of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cytotrienin A/B and syringomycin E.2,3 Crystal structures of several \u03b1-KG-depend-ent halogenases have been determined.4-6 The structure of SyrB2 reveals that the iron(II) center is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from histidine residues, a chloride anion, one water, and a bidentate \u03b1-KG cofactor.4 The catalytic mechanism has been proposed to follow a pathway similar to that of \u03b1-KG-dependent oxygenases. The reductive activation of dioxygen at the iron center with concomitant decarbox-ylation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate results in an iron(IV)-oxo-chloro species (Scheme 1). The high-valent iron-oxo intermediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to initiate the halogenation reaction.2,3,7,8 The substrate radical then combines with the chloride radical producing chlorinated product and regenerating the reduced iron(II) center. After formation of the substrate carbon radical, however, competi-tion between transfer of Cl\u2022 and OH\u2022 would be expected. No hydroxylation reaction has been observed in enzymatic systems indicating that Cl\u2022 transfer is the most favored pathway. The hydrogen bonding pattern at the active site and the lower potential of Cl\u2022 versus OH\u2022 likely contribute to the selectivity.9,10 Thorough experimental studies on SyrB2 suggested that substrate positioning was a crucial criterion for controlling the enzyme selectivity.9,11 Computational studies indicated that the halogenation selectivity originated from the deactivation of the hydroxyl radical rebound site either by protonation of the hydroxyl group12 or by the CO2 formed in the halogenation cycle.13 Received: February 15, 2018 Published: July 16, 2018 Scheme 1. Proposed Catalytic Cycle of \u03b1-Ketoglutarate-Though there have been extensive studies on the enzymatic structure and function of nonheme halogenases, examples of synthetic models of this group of enzmyes are rare.14-20 Several iron(IV)-oxo-halo complexes, that mimic the active oxidant of nonheme halogenases, have been isolated and characterized.15,21,22 Among the reported complexes, the S = 1 iron(IV)-oxo-halo complexes of tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) and the S = 2 iron(IV)-oxo-halo intermediates of tris(quinolyl-2-methyl)amine) (TQA) ligand have been reported to halogenate the C-H bond of cyclohexane.23 Aliphatic C-H bond halogenations by most of the reported complexes were performed with oxidants such as PhIO or peroxides. Recently, we reported a nonheme iron(II)-benzilate complex, which, in combination with a protic acid and chloride ion, performed O2-dependent halogenation of aliphatic substartes with weak C-H bonds.20 However, there is no report of a nonheme iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complex exhibiting C-H bond halogenation with O2. In our efforts to mimic the function of the \u03b1-KG-dependent nonheme halogenases, we have investigated the reactivity of iron(II)-\u03b1-ketoacid-halide complexes supported by tridentate nitrogen donor ligands. We report herein the isolation, dioxygen reactivity, and ability for aliphatic C-H bond halogenation of a mononuclear iron(II)-benzoylformate-chloro complex [(phdpa)Fe(BF)Cl] (1) and a dinuclear iron(II)-benzoylformate-chloro complex [(1,4-tpbd)Fe2(BF)2Cl2] (2) (BF = benzoylformate, phdpa = N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aniline, and 1,4-tpbd = N,N,N\u2032,N\u2019-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)benzene-1,4-diamine).24 Both the complexes activate O2 and perform C-H bond halogenation in addition to C-H bond oxygenation. Unlike complex 1, which can halogenate the weak C-H bonds, complex 2 is able to carry out the halogenation of strong C-H bonds including that of cyclohexane. The effect of the second metal center in complex 2 on the dioxygen-dependent C-H bond halogenation is presented in this work. Scheme 2. Synthesis of Iron(II)-Benzoylformate Complexes  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The iron(II)-BF-Cl complexes (1 and 2) were isolated from the reactions between the respective ligand, FeCl2 and sodium benzoylformate (NaBF) in a solvent mixture (5:1) of CH2Cl2 and CH3OH (Scheme 2 and Experimental Section). The UV-vis spectrum of 1 in CH3CN exhibited broad adsorption bands at 580 nm (240 M-1 cm-1) and 645 nm (240 M-1 cm-1) (Figure S1). Similarly, complex 2 displayed adsorption bands at 592 nm (700 M-1 cm-1) and 650 nm (710 M-1 cm-1) (Figure S1). These absorption features are characteristics of BF coordinated to an iron(II) center in a bidentate mode. The absorption bands originate from the charge transfer transitions from iron(II) to \u03c0* of the keto group of BF.25,26 The 1H NMR spectra of both of the complexes in CDCl3 exhibited paramagentically shifted proton resonances typical of high-spin iron(II) complexes (Figures S2 and S3). Complex 2, however, exhibited a smaller number of proton resonances compared to complex 1 in the region between 5 and 20 ppm indicating a centrosymmetric structure in solution. The binding modes of the ligands and the geometry of the complexes were further established from X-ray diffraction studies. Complex 1 showed a mononuclear iron(II) center coordinated by the tridentate phdpa ligand and a monoanionic benzoylformate. The supporting ligand coordinates in the facial mode, and the BF is coordinated in a bidentate fashion via a carboxylate oxygen (O2) and the carbonyl oxygen (O1). A chloride ligand occupies the sixth coordination site of the iron center (Figure 1a). The Fe-O2 (carboxylate) bond distance of 2.044(2) \u00c5 is shorter than the Fe-O1 (keto) bond of 2.204(2) \u00c5 (Table 1). Complex 2 is a dinuclear system where each of the iron centers is coordinated by the N3 donors from bis(tridentate) ligand (Figure 1b). The remaining sites of each iron center are occupied by a bidentate BF and a chloride donor. The average Fe-N (pyridine) distance varies in the range 2.148(3)-2.446(3) \u00c5, which matches well with the reported high-spin iron(II)-BF complexes.25 As in 1, the Fe-O2 (carboxylate) bond in 2 is shorter than the Fe-O1 (keto) bond. The pyridine nitrogen N3 and the keto oxygen (O1) occupy the axial positions with the N3-Fe1-O1 angle of 170.82(10)\u00b0. The chloride ligand binds trans to the amine nitrogen (N2), and compared to Fe-N(pyridine), the Fe-N2 bond distance is much longer in both the complexes (Table 1). The two iron centers in 2 are separated at a distance of 8.739 \u00c5 and do not interact with each other as is evident from the solid state structure. The Fe-Cl bond distance of 2.390(1) \u00c5 in 2 is slightly elongated compared to that in 1 (2.3685(7) \u00c5). Of note, the Fe-Cl distance of 2.44 \u00c5 has been reported for the structure of SyrB2 (at 1.6 \u00c5 resolution) coordinated by a chloride and \u03b1-ketoglutarate.4 The iron(II)-BF complexes are stable in the solid state and in solution under inert atmosphere but are sensitive to air. For an acetonitrile solution of complex 1 upon exposure to dry O2 gas, the charge transfer bands decayed over a period of 6 h (Figure S4). For complex 2, however, the charge transfer bands took 4 h for complete decay (Figure 2). Time-dependent 1H NMR spectra revealed that the coordinated BF took 50 and 8 h for complete decarboxylation to benzoate for 1 and 2, respectively (Figure S5 and Figure 3). Although the dinuclear complex exhibited an enhanced rate of decarboxylation, there was a mismatch between the time for decay of the CT chromophore and the time taken for complete decarbox-ylation. Time-dependent X-band EPR studies during the reaction between 2 and dioxygen indicated that the reaction solution remained X-band EPR silent until 3 h, during which time more than 60% conversion of benzoylformate to benzoate took place (Figure S6). These observations do not support the involvement of any iron(III) species generated via one-electron oxidation of the iron(II) center without involving benzoylfor-mate. Upon confirmation of the conversion of BF to benzoic acid, the fate of the oxygen atoms of dioxygen was determined by 18-O labeling experiments. The GC-MS of benzoic acid showed an ion peak at m/z 122, which shifted two mass units higher to m/z 124 when the decarboxylation reaction was Table 1. Selected Bond Parameters for 1 and 2 carried out with 18O2 (Figure 4). These results confirmed the incorporation of one oxygen atom from dioxygen. Enzymatic studies have established the formation of high-valent iron-oxo oxidants in the decarboxylation of \u03b1-KG.3,8,27 Unfortunately, no iron-oxygen intermediate was detected in the reactions of the complexes (1 and 2) with dioxygen. As reported with other iron(II)-BF model complexes,28-30 various external substrates were used to intercept in situ generated iron-oxygen oxidants. The reaction of 1 with thioanisole (20 equiv) afforded thioanisole oxide in 5% yield (Figure S7). Complex 2, under similar experimental conditions, showed 11% conversion of thioanisole (Table 2). The labeling experiment with 18O2 revealed around 93% incorporation of labeled oxygen into thioanisole oxide (Figure 5). However, a mixed labeling experiment with 16O2/H2 18O did not show incorporation of labeled oxygen from water into the product, confirming that the active oxidant from 2 could not exchange its oxygen atom with water. 9,10-Dihydroanthracene, fluorene, and benzyl alcohol were oxidized to anthracene, fluorenone, and benzaldehyde, respectively, by both 1 and 2 (Table 2). An approximately 2-to 3-fold increase in the yields of oxidized products was obtained for all the substrates in the oxidation by the dinuclear complex. Mononuclear complex 1 was unable to oxidize alkenes such as cyclooctene, 1-octene, trans-2-heptene, and cis-2-heptene. In contrast, complex 2 oxidized alkenes selectively to the corresponding epoxides but in low yields (Table 2). The reaction of 2 with cyclooctene afforded cyclooctene oxide in 24% yield (Figure S8). With trans-2-heptene as a substrate, only trans-2-heptene oxide (29%) was detected (Figure S9). However, the oxidation of cis-2-heptene yielded a mixture of cis-2-heptene oxide (14%) and trans-2-heptene oxide (17%) (Figures S10 and S11). 1-Octene was conveted to 1,2-epoxyoctane (8%) in the reaction of 2 with dioxygen (Figure S12). Importantly, when cyclohexene was used as a substrate in the reaction between 1 and O2, 3-chlorocyclohexene (4%) (Scheme 3) was formed along with 2-cyclohexenol (6%) and 2-cyclohexenone (11%) (Table 3). Similarly, for 1,4-cyclo-hexadiene the corresponding unsaturated chlorinated product was obtained in 5% yield (Table 3). Importantly, the dinuclear Figure 3. Time-dependent complex 2 showed enhanced reactivity toward oxygenation as well as halogenation of alkanes. In the reaction with 2, cyclohexene afforded 3-chlorocyclohexene in 14% yield, and the oxygenated products, 2-cyclohexanol and 2-cyclohexanone, were formed in 16% and 12%, respectively (Table 3 and Figure S13). 1,4-Cyclohexadiene was transformed to the correspond-ing unsaturated chlorinated product in 16% yield (Scheme 3 and Figure S14). Of note, the control experiment with a combination of FeCl2, sodium benzoylformate, and substrate in O2-saturated acetonitrile did not afford any halogenated product (Experimental Section). The reactivity of the dinuclear complex (2), when compared with the mononuclear complex (1), increased appreciably in terms of C-H bond halogenation (Scheme 3 and Table 3). Though toluene afforded a trace amount of benzaldehyde without any halogenated product, the active oxidant generated from 1 was not reactive enough to cleave the C-H bonds of ethylbenzene and adamantane. On the contrary, the C-H bonds of these substrates were halogenated by the dinuclear complex 2 and O2. Benzyl chloride and 1-phenylethyl chloride were obtained in 5-6% yield from toluene and ethylbenzene, respectively (Figures S15 and S16). Adamantane got oxidatively chlorinated to 1-chloroadamantane (11%). In the reaction, 1-adamantanol (12%) along with a negligible amount of 2-adamantanol was also formed (Figure S17). A substrate with very strong C-H bonds such as cyclohexane (100 equiv) afforded cyclohexanol (5%) and cyclohexanone (7%) without any halogenated product in the reaction with 2. However, when the amount of cyclohexane was increased up to 1000 equiv, the formation of chlorocyclohexane (6%) (Scheme 3) Figure 5. GC-MS of thioanisole oxide obtained from the reaction between 2 and thioanisole (20 equiv) with (a) was observed along with cyclohexanol (10%) and cyclo-hexanone (18%) (Figure S18). 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzoic acid (TMBA) was used as a substrate to evaluate the effect of the carboxylate group on C-H bond halogenation. TMBA underwent benzylic C-H bond halogenation by 1 and 2 affording 10% and 29% halogenation product, respectively (Table 3 and Figure S19). The higher yield of the chlorinated product from TMBA compared to those from toluene and ethylbenzene suggested the role of the -COOH group of TMBA in directing the reaction toward the halogenation pathway. Thus, dinuclear complex 2 ensured not only the halogenation of strong C-H bonds including those of cyclohexane, but also an approximately 2-3 fold increase in the yields of halogenated products was observed for substrates with weak C-H bonds. Although the iron centers in the dinuclear complex are separated at a distance of 8.739 \u00c5, the two are connected through a benzene-14-diamine spacer. It is therefore hypothesized that the electronic effect of one site influences the reactivity of the other in terms of C-H bond halogenation/hydroxylation. However, the exact reason for increased reactivity in the dinuclear complex remains unclear. The difference in the amount of halogenated products from substrates of varying C-H bond strengths along with the results of control experiments (Experimental Section) indicated the involvement of a metal-based oxidant in the halogenation reactions. The yield of the halogenated product of cyclohexane did not increase upon addition of Bu4NCl in the reaction with 2 and dioxygen. From the relative percentage of oxygenated products in competitive oxidation of toluene and toluene-d8 by 2, a KIE value of 9.3 was estimated (Figure S20). While the halogenation reactions of aliphatic substrates were not affected by the presence of radical scavengers such as tert-butanol and 1,4-benzoquinone, the addition of thioanisole inhibited the halogenation of cyclohexane completely. Furthermore, complex 2 selectively oxidized cylobutanol to cyclobutanone (Figure S21). These results suggested in situ generation of a two-electron oxidant and ruled out the involvement of any free-radical mechanism in the reaction pathway. Therefore, a metal-based oxidant is proposed to perform the halogenation of C-H bonds. By analogy to other reported iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes, a putative iron(IV)-oxo species is generated in situ upon reductive activation of O2 at the iron(II) center and subsequent decarboxylation of the coordinated \u03b1-keto acid (Scheme S1).28,30 Since the iron centers in both the complexes (1 and 2) are coordinatively saturated, one of the labile donors (pyridine or keto oxygen of BF) may dissociate to activate dioxygen at a five-coordinate iron(II) center leading to the generation of the iron-oxo oxidant. The relatively strong binding of chloride anion possibly blocks the labile coordination site at the iron center preventing exchange between water and the oxygen atom of the active oxidant.15 The iron-oxo species abstracts the hydrogen atom from a C-H bond of substrate. The resulting iron(III)-hydroxo-chloro species in the solvent cage would then react with the alkyl radical to yield hydroxylated (via OH\u2022 rebound) or halogenated (via Cl\u2022 rebound) products. Here the reaction pathway differs from the enzymatic mechanism because the preferred Cl\u2022 rebound step directs the selectivity in halogenases. The low yields of halogenated product with 1 and 2 suggested that the Cl\u2022 rebound was slower compared to the cage escape of the alkyl radical and subsequent reaction with O2. 31 A high 3\u00b0/2\u00b0 value for adamantane oxidation indicated a longer lifetime of the resulting alkyl radical. This was further supported by the results of the oxidation of Table 3. Halogenation/Oxygenation of Aliphatic C-H cyclohexane by 2 in the presence of varying amounts of alkyl radical trap CCl3Br (1-5 equiv) (Table 4). With 5 equiv of CCl3Br, the yield of chlorocyclohexane remained the same (6%), whereas the yields of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone decreased to 8-9% along with 12% bromocyclohexane. The cage escape alkyl radical reacted with O2 and with CCl3Br resulting in oxygenated or brominated products, respectively. That observation supported a low alcohol-to-ketone ratio in the oxidation of cyclohexane. In the absence of any substrate, the putative iron-oxo oxidant decayed to some unidentified iron(III) product as observed in the X-band EPR spectrum (Figure S6).  CONCLUSIONS We have developed two nonheme iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes that activated the C-H bonds of aliphatic substrates with O2 to form the corresponding halogenated product. The dinuclear complex exhibited enhanced reactivity compared to the mononuclear complex. Unlike enzyme systems, the formation of hydroxylated/oxidized products could not be avoided and the halogenated products were detected in low yields. Yet the complexes presented here represent the only examples of nonheme iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes exhibiting bioinspired C-H bond halogenation. The strong iron-chloro bond and slow rebound of chloride radical to substrate-derived alkyl radical resulted in low yield and selectivity in halogenation reactions. Design of supporting ligands incorporating electronic/structural features for enhanc-ing the rate of chloride rebound step and deactivating the hydroxide rebound step might allow achievement of selective halogenation of aliphatic C-H bonds with nonheme iron complexes and dioxygen.

The iron(II)-BF-Cl complex (0.02 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of dry acetonitrile. To the resulting solution was added an excess amount of substrate. Pure dry oxygen was purged through the solution and was allowed to stir at room temperature. After the oxidation, the resulting solution was then passed through a 15 cm silica column (60-120 mesh size) using dichloromethane/diethyl ether as eluent. The combined organic phase was then analyzed by GC-MS. Quantification of the oxidized products was calculated using standard calibration curves obtained using authentic compounds and naphthalene as a standard which was added to the reaction mixture after desired reaction time but prior to separation through column. Control Experiments. Separate control experiments were performed with phdpa/1,4-tpbd ligand (0.02 mmol) and sodium benzoylformate (1 equiv) in the presence of substrate (100 equiv of cyclohexene or 1000 equiv of cyclohexane) in O2-saturated acetonitrile. Another control experiment was performed with phdpa ligand (0.02 mmol) and iron(II) chloride (1 equiv) in the presence of substrate in O2-saturated acetonitrile solvent. No oxidized/halo-genated product derived from substrate was formed in all the cases. Additionally, the combination of FeCl2 (0.02 mmol), sodium benzoylformate (1 equiv), and cyclohexene (100 equiv) or cyclo-hexane (1000 equiv) in O2-saturated acetonitrile does not afford any halogenated product. Competitive Oxidation Reaction. Competitive oxidation reactions are carried out by dinuclear complex 2 (0.02 mmol) with thioanisole (50 equiv) and cyclohexane (1000 equiv). In the reaction, only 9% thioanisole oxide was formed along with trace amounts of chlorocyclohexane (approx 1%), cyclohexanol (1%), and cyclo-hexanone (5%).

X-ray single-crystal data for 1 and 2 were collected at 120 K (Table 5) using Mo K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.7107 \u00c5) radiation on a SMART-APEX diffractometer equipped with a CCD area detector. Data collection, data reduction, and structure solution and refinement were carried out using the software package of APEX II.32 The structure was solved by direct methods and subsequent Fourier analyses and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method based on F2 with all observed reflections.33 The non-hydrogen atoms were treated anisotropically. Routine SQUEEZE34 was applied to intensity data of complex 2 to take into account the disordered solvent molecules.

        "ABSTRACT: \u03b1-Ketoglutarate-dependent nonheme halo-genases catalyze the halogenation of aliphatic C-H bonds in the biosynthesis pathway of many natural products. An iron(IV)-oxo-halo species has been established as the active oxidant in the halogenation reactions. With an objective to emulate the function of the nonheme halogenases, two iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes, [(phdpa)Fe(BF)Cl] (1) and [(1,4-tpbd)Fe2(BF)2Cl2] (2) (where phdpa = N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aniline, 1,4-tpbd = N,N,N\u2032,N\u2019-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)benzene-1,4-diamine, and BF = benzoylfor-mate), have been prepared. The iron complexes are capable of carrying out the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic C-H bonds using O2 as the terminal oxidant. Although the complexes are not selective toward C-H bond halogenation, they are the only examples of nonheme iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes mimicking the activity of nonheme halogenases. The dinuclear complex (2) exhibits enhanced reactivity toward C-H bond halogenation/hydroxylation.",
        "INTRODUCTION The halogenation of aliphatic C-H bonds is a unique chemical reaction in biology. Biosyntheses of a large variety of natural products involve the halogenation of unactivated C-H bonds at aliphatic carbon centers. In the biosynthetic processes, \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG)-dependent nonheme iron halogenases activate O2 to halogenate aliphatic C-H bonds of substrates.1 CytC3 and SyrB2 are examples of this group of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cytotrienin A/B and syringomycin E.2,3 Crystal structures of several \u03b1-KG-depend-ent halogenases have been determined.4-6 The structure of SyrB2 reveals that the iron(II) center is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from histidine residues, a chloride anion, one water, and a bidentate \u03b1-KG cofactor.4 The catalytic mechanism has been proposed to follow a pathway similar to that of \u03b1-KG-dependent oxygenases. The reductive activation of dioxygen at the iron center with concomitant decarbox-ylation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate results in an iron(IV)-oxo-chloro species (Scheme 1). The high-valent iron-oxo intermediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to initiate the halogenation reaction.2,3,7,8 The substrate radical then combines with the chloride radical producing chlorinated product and regenerating the reduced iron(II) center. After formation of the substrate carbon radical, however, competi-tion between transfer of Cl\u2022 and OH\u2022 would be expected. No hydroxylation reaction has been observed in enzymatic systems indicating that Cl\u2022 transfer is the most favored pathway. The hydrogen bonding pattern at the active site and the lower potential of Cl\u2022 versus OH\u2022 likely contribute to the selectivity.9,10 Thorough experimental studies on SyrB2 suggested that substrate positioning was a crucial criterion for controlling the enzyme selectivity.9,11 Computational studies indicated that the halogenation selectivity originated from the deactivation of the hydroxyl radical rebound site either by protonation of the hydroxyl group12 or by the CO2 formed in the halogenation cycle.13",

        "Though there have been extensive studies on the enzymatic structure and function of nonheme halogenases, examples of synthetic models of this group of enzmyes are rare.14-20 Several iron(IV)-oxo-halo complexes, that mimic the active oxidant of nonheme halogenases, have been isolated and characterized.15,21,22 Among the reported complexes, the S = 1 iron(IV)-oxo-halo complexes of tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) and the S = 2 iron(IV)-oxo-halo intermediates of tris(quinolyl-2-methyl)amine) (TQA) ligand have been reported to halogenate the C-H bond of cyclohexane.23 Aliphatic C-H bond halogenations by most of the reported complexes were performed with oxidants such as PhIO or peroxides. Recently, we reported a nonheme iron(II)-benzilate complex, which, in combination with a protic acid and chloride ion, performed O2-dependent halogenation of aliphatic substartes with weak C-H bonds.20 However, there is no report of a nonheme iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complex exhibiting C-H bond halogenation with O2. In our efforts to mimic the function of the \u03b1-KG-dependent nonheme halogenases, we have investigated the reactivity of iron(II)-\u03b1-ketoacid-halide complexes supported by tridentate nitrogen donor ligands. We report herein the isolation, dioxygen reactivity, and ability for aliphatic C-H bond halogenation of a mononuclear iron(II)-benzoylformate-chloro complex [(phdpa)Fe(BF)Cl] (1) and a dinuclear iron(II)-benzoylformate-chloro complex [(1,4-tpbd)Fe2(BF)2Cl2] (2) (BF = benzoylformate, phdpa = N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aniline, and 1,4-tpbd = N,N,N\u2032,N\u2019-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)benzene-1,4-diamine).24 Both the complexes activate O2 and perform C-H bond halogenation in addition to C-H bond oxygenation. Unlike complex 1, which can halogenate the weak C-H bonds, complex 2 is able to carry out the halogenation of strong C-H bonds including that of cyclohexane. The effect of the second metal center in complex 2 on the dioxygen-dependent C-H bond halogenation is presented in this work.",
        "Scheme 2. Synthesis of Iron(II)-Benzoylformate Complexes",
        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The iron(II)-BF-Cl complexes (1 and 2) were isolated from the reactions between the respective ligand, FeCl2 and sodium benzoylformate (NaBF) in a solvent mixture (5:1) of CH2Cl2 and CH3OH (Scheme 2 and Experimental Section). The UV-vis spectrum of 1 in CH3CN exhibited broad adsorption bands at 580 nm (240 M-1 cm-1) and 645 nm (240 M-1 cm-1) (Figure S1). Similarly, complex 2 displayed adsorption bands at 592 nm (700 M-1 cm-1) and 650 nm (710 M-1 cm-1) (Figure S1). These absorption features are characteristics of BF coordinated to an iron(II) center in a bidentate mode. The absorption bands originate from the charge transfer transitions from iron(II) to \u03c0* of the keto group of BF.25,26 The 1H NMR spectra of both of the complexes in CDCl3 exhibited paramagentically shifted proton resonances typical of high-spin iron(II) complexes (Figures S2 and S3). Complex 2, however, exhibited a smaller number of proton resonances compared to complex 1 in the region between 5 and 20 ppm indicating a centrosymmetric structure in solution.",
        "The binding modes of the ligands and the geometry of the complexes were further established from X-ray diffraction studies. Complex 1 showed a mononuclear iron(II) center coordinated by the tridentate phdpa ligand and a monoanionic benzoylformate. The supporting ligand coordinates in the facial mode, and the BF is coordinated in a bidentate fashion via a carboxylate oxygen (O2) and the carbonyl oxygen (O1). A chloride ligand occupies the sixth coordination site of the iron center (Figure 1a). The Fe-O2 (carboxylate) bond distance of 2.044(2) \u00c5 is shorter than the Fe-O1 (keto) bond of 2.204(2) \u00c5 (Table 1). Complex 2 is a dinuclear system",
        "where each of the iron centers is coordinated by the N3 donors from bis(tridentate) ligand (Figure 1b). The remaining sites of each iron center are occupied by a bidentate BF and a chloride donor. The average Fe-N (pyridine) distance varies in the range 2.148(3)-2.446(3) \u00c5, which matches well with the reported high-spin iron(II)-BF complexes.25 As in 1, the Fe-O2 (carboxylate) bond in 2 is shorter than the Fe-O1 (keto) bond. The pyridine nitrogen N3 and the keto oxygen (O1) occupy the axial positions with the N3-Fe1-O1 angle of 170.82(10)\u00b0. The chloride ligand binds trans to the amine nitrogen (N2), and compared to Fe-N(pyridine), the Fe-N2 bond distance is much longer in both the complexes (Table 1). The two iron centers in 2 are separated at a distance of 8.739 \u00c5 and do not interact with each other as is evident from the solid state structure. The Fe-Cl bond distance of 2.390(1) \u00c5 in 2 is slightly elongated compared to that in 1 (2.3685(7) \u00c5). Of note, the Fe-Cl distance of 2.44 \u00c5 has been reported for the structure of SyrB2 (at 1.6 \u00c5 resolution) coordinated by a chloride and \u03b1-ketoglutarate.4",
        "The iron(II)-BF complexes are stable in the solid state and in solution under inert atmosphere but are sensitive to air. For an acetonitrile solution of complex 1 upon exposure to dry O2 gas, the charge transfer bands decayed over a period of 6 h (Figure S4). For complex 2, however, the charge transfer bands took 4 h for complete decay (Figure 2). Time-dependent 1H",
        "NMR spectra revealed that the coordinated BF took 50 and 8 h for complete decarboxylation to benzoate for 1 and 2, respectively (Figure S5 and Figure 3). Although the dinuclear complex exhibited an enhanced rate of decarboxylation, there was a mismatch between the time for decay of the CT chromophore and the time taken for complete decarbox-ylation. Time-dependent X-band EPR studies during the reaction between 2 and dioxygen indicated that the reaction solution remained X-band EPR silent until 3 h, during which time more than 60% conversion of benzoylformate to benzoate took place (Figure S6). These observations do not support the involvement of any iron(III) species generated via one-electron oxidation of the iron(II) center without involving benzoylfor-mate.",
        "Upon confirmation of the conversion of BF to benzoic acid, the fate of the oxygen atoms of dioxygen was determined by 18-O labeling experiments. The GC-MS of benzoic acid showed an ion peak at m/z 122, which shifted two mass units higher to m/z 124 when the decarboxylation reaction was",
        "Table 1. Selected Bond Parameters for 1 and 2",
        "carried out with 18O2 (Figure 4). These results confirmed the incorporation of one oxygen atom from dioxygen.",
        "Enzymatic studies have established the formation of high-valent iron-oxo oxidants in the decarboxylation of \u03b1-KG.3,8,27 Unfortunately, no iron-oxygen intermediate was detected in the reactions of the complexes (1 and 2) with dioxygen. As reported with other iron(II)-BF model complexes,28-30 various external substrates were used to intercept in situ generated iron-oxygen oxidants. The reaction of 1 with thioanisole (20 equiv) afforded thioanisole oxide in 5% yield (Figure S7). Complex 2, under similar experimental conditions, showed 11% conversion of thioanisole (Table 2). The labeling experiment with 18O2 revealed around 93% incorporation of labeled oxygen into thioanisole oxide (Figure 5). However, a mixed labeling experiment with 16O2/H2 18O did not show incorporation of labeled oxygen from water into the product, confirming that the active oxidant from 2 could not exchange its oxygen atom with water. 9,10-Dihydroanthracene, fluorene, and benzyl alcohol were oxidized to anthracene, fluorenone, and benzaldehyde, respectively, by both 1 and 2 (Table 2). An approximately 2-to 3-fold increase in the yields of oxidized products was obtained for all the substrates in the oxidation by the dinuclear complex.",
        "Mononuclear complex 1 was unable to oxidize alkenes such as cyclooctene, 1-octene, trans-2-heptene, and cis-2-heptene. In contrast, complex 2 oxidized alkenes selectively to the corresponding epoxides but in low yields (Table 2). The reaction of 2 with cyclooctene afforded cyclooctene oxide in 24% yield (Figure S8). With trans-2-heptene as a substrate, only trans-2-heptene oxide (29%) was detected (Figure S9). However, the oxidation of cis-2-heptene yielded a mixture of cis-2-heptene oxide (14%) and trans-2-heptene oxide (17%) (Figures S10 and S11). 1-Octene was conveted to 1,2-epoxyoctane (8%) in the reaction of 2 with dioxygen (Figure S12).",
        "Importantly, when cyclohexene was used as a substrate in the reaction between 1 and O2, 3-chlorocyclohexene (4%) (Scheme 3) was formed along with 2-cyclohexenol (6%) and 2-cyclohexenone (11%) (Table 3). Similarly, for 1,4-cyclo-hexadiene the corresponding unsaturated chlorinated product was obtained in 5% yield (Table 3). Importantly, the dinuclear",
        "Figure 3. Time-dependent",
        "complex 2 showed enhanced reactivity toward oxygenation as well as halogenation of alkanes. In the reaction with 2, cyclohexene afforded 3-chlorocyclohexene in 14% yield, and the oxygenated products, 2-cyclohexanol and 2-cyclohexanone, were formed in 16% and 12%, respectively (Table 3 and Figure S13). 1,4-Cyclohexadiene was transformed to the correspond-ing unsaturated chlorinated product in 16% yield (Scheme 3 and Figure S14). Of note, the control experiment with a combination of FeCl2, sodium benzoylformate, and substrate in O2-saturated acetonitrile did not afford any halogenated product (Experimental Section).",
        "The reactivity of the dinuclear complex (2), when compared with the mononuclear complex (1), increased appreciably in terms of C-H bond halogenation (Scheme 3 and Table 3). Though toluene afforded a trace amount of benzaldehyde without any halogenated product, the active oxidant generated from 1 was not reactive enough to cleave the C-H bonds of ethylbenzene and adamantane. On the contrary, the C-H bonds of these substrates were halogenated by the dinuclear complex 2 and O2. Benzyl chloride and 1-phenylethyl chloride were obtained in 5-6% yield from toluene and ethylbenzene, respectively (Figures S15 and S16). Adamantane got oxidatively chlorinated to 1-chloroadamantane (11%). In the reaction, 1-adamantanol (12%) along with a negligible amount of 2-adamantanol was also formed (Figure S17). A substrate with very strong C-H bonds such as cyclohexane (100 equiv) afforded cyclohexanol (5%) and cyclohexanone (7%) without any halogenated product in the reaction with 2. However, when the amount of cyclohexane was increased up to 1000 equiv, the formation of chlorocyclohexane (6%) (Scheme 3)",
        "Figure 5. GC-MS of thioanisole oxide obtained from the reaction between 2 and thioanisole (20 equiv) with (a)",
        "was observed along with cyclohexanol (10%) and cyclo-hexanone (18%) (Figure S18). 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzoic acid (TMBA) was used as a substrate to evaluate the effect of the carboxylate group on C-H bond halogenation. TMBA underwent benzylic C-H bond halogenation by 1 and 2 affording 10% and 29% halogenation product, respectively (Table 3 and Figure S19). The higher yield of the chlorinated product from TMBA compared to those from toluene and ethylbenzene suggested the role of the -COOH group of TMBA in directing the reaction toward the halogenation pathway. Thus, dinuclear complex 2 ensured not only the halogenation of strong C-H bonds including those of cyclohexane, but also an approximately 2-3 fold increase in the yields of halogenated products was observed for substrates with weak C-H bonds. Although the iron centers in the dinuclear complex are separated at a distance of 8.739 \u00c5, the two are connected through a benzene-14-diamine spacer. It is therefore hypothesized that the electronic effect of one site influences the reactivity of the other in terms of C-H bond halogenation/hydroxylation. However, the exact reason for increased reactivity in the dinuclear complex remains unclear.",
        "The difference in the amount of halogenated products from substrates of varying C-H bond strengths along with the results of control experiments (Experimental Section) indicated the involvement of a metal-based oxidant in the halogenation reactions. The yield of the halogenated product of cyclohexane did not increase upon addition of Bu4NCl in the reaction with 2 and dioxygen. From the relative percentage of oxygenated products in competitive oxidation of toluene and toluene-d8 by 2, a KIE value of 9.3 was estimated (Figure S20). While the halogenation reactions of aliphatic substrates were not affected by the presence of radical scavengers such as tert-butanol and 1,4-benzoquinone, the addition of thioanisole inhibited the halogenation of cyclohexane completely. Furthermore, complex 2 selectively oxidized cylobutanol to cyclobutanone (Figure S21). These results suggested in situ generation of a two-electron oxidant and ruled out the involvement of any free-radical mechanism in the reaction pathway.",
        "Therefore, a metal-based oxidant is proposed to perform the halogenation of C-H bonds. By analogy to other reported iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes, a putative iron(IV)-oxo species is generated in situ upon reductive activation of O2 at the iron(II) center and subsequent decarboxylation of the coordinated \u03b1-keto acid (Scheme S1).28,30 Since the iron centers in both the complexes (1 and 2) are coordinatively saturated, one of the labile donors (pyridine or keto oxygen of BF) may dissociate to activate dioxygen at a five-coordinate iron(II) center leading to the generation of the iron-oxo oxidant. The relatively strong binding of chloride anion possibly blocks the labile coordination site at the iron center preventing exchange between water and the oxygen atom of the active oxidant.15 The iron-oxo species abstracts the hydrogen atom from a C-H bond of substrate. The resulting iron(III)-hydroxo-chloro species in the solvent cage would then react with the alkyl radical to yield hydroxylated (via OH\u2022 rebound) or halogenated (via Cl\u2022 rebound) products. Here the reaction pathway differs from the enzymatic mechanism because the preferred Cl\u2022 rebound step directs the selectivity in halogenases. The low yields of halogenated product with 1 and 2 suggested that the Cl\u2022 rebound was slower compared to the cage escape of the alkyl radical and subsequent reaction with O2. 31 A high 3\u00b0/2\u00b0 value for adamantane oxidation indicated a longer lifetime of the resulting alkyl radical. This was further supported by the results of the oxidation of",
        "Table 3. Halogenation/Oxygenation of Aliphatic C-H",
        "cyclohexane by 2 in the presence of varying amounts of alkyl radical trap CCl3Br (1-5 equiv) (Table 4). With 5 equiv of CCl3Br, the yield of chlorocyclohexane remained the same (6%), whereas the yields of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone decreased to 8-9% along with 12% bromocyclohexane. The cage escape alkyl radical reacted with O2 and with CCl3Br resulting in oxygenated or brominated products, respectively. That observation supported a low alcohol-to-ketone ratio in the oxidation of cyclohexane. In the absence of any substrate, the putative iron-oxo oxidant decayed to some unidentified iron(III) product as observed in the X-band EPR spectrum (Figure S6).",
        "CONCLUSIONS We have developed two nonheme iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes that activated the C-H bonds of aliphatic substrates with O2 to form the corresponding halogenated product. The dinuclear complex exhibited enhanced reactivity compared to the mononuclear complex. Unlike enzyme systems, the formation of hydroxylated/oxidized products could not be avoided and the halogenated products were detected in low yields. Yet the complexes presented here represent the only examples of nonheme iron(II)-\u03b1-keto acid complexes exhibiting bioinspired C-H bond halogenation. The strong iron-chloro bond and slow rebound of chloride radical to substrate-derived alkyl radical resulted in low yield and selectivity in halogenation reactions. Design of supporting ligands incorporating electronic/structural features for enhanc-ing the rate of chloride rebound step and deactivating the hydroxide rebound step might allow achievement of selective halogenation of aliphatic C-H bonds with nonheme iron complexes and dioxygen.",
