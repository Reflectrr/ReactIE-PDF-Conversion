This finding uncovers a previously unknown mode of collaboration amongIPKSs and further demonstrates how a limited number of IPKSs can be combined togenerate highly complex scaffolds.The common bicyclic pyrano-quinone scaffold observed in the azaphilones family ofpolyketides is biosynthesized by a NR-PKS. The reduced substituents, such as those in 1 and2 are synthesized by a partnering HR-PKS found in each gene cluster.4,5C. globosum is afilamentous fungi that has been reported to produce a large variety of azaphilones; includingthe chaetoviridins 3,6 B (5)6,7 and C (6)6, as well as chaetomugilins 4,8 and M (7)9 (Figure1). Unlike 1 and 2, the chlorinated 3, 6 and 7 contain an angular lactone ring attached to theisochromenone core, whereas 4 and 5 contain a tetracyclic isochromenone-lactol-lactonestructure.7,10\u201312 Based on their structural similarities, we propose that 3\u20137 are assembled viaa common biosynthetic pathway. Feeding experiments with [1,2-13C2]acetate confirmed thatthe entire molecule of 4 is derived from a polyketide backbone (Figures 1 and S1), which isconsistent with previous isotopic experiments with structurally related azaphilones.6,13\u201315Structural inspection of 3 and 4 reveals that in contrast to 1 and 2, additional IPKSmachinery must be required for their biosynthesis. It can be speculated that assembly of thenorthern portions of 3 and 4 follows the biosynthetic logic of 1, in which a sequentialcollaboration of HR-and NR-PKS is required; whereas the southern portions mimic that of2, in which the product of a different IPKS is combined with the northern portion in aconvergent manner. Hence, we hypothesized that up to three IPKSs may be found in thebiosynthetic gene cluster of 3\u20137.Using the HR-PKS and NR-PKS sequences from the gene clusters of 1 and 2 identified inAspergillus nidulans4 and A. niger5, respectively, the genome of C. globosum was scannedfor putative azaphilone biosynthetic clusters containing two or more IPKSs. Three clusterscontaining a HR-PKS and a NR-PKS in close proximity to each other were identified.Additionally, each cluster contained a predicted FADH2-dependent halogenase that wouldbe expected for introducing a chlorine atom onto the bicyclic core. Interestingly, none ofthese clusters contained three IPKSs as we hypothesized. Only one cluster (hereby namedthe caz cluster) encoded a putative acyltransferase (cazE) that would be required fortransfering the convergent polyketide fragment (southern portion) to the pyranoquinonesubstrate (northern protion) to form 3\u20137. This 65-kb caz cluster was annotated to encode 16open reading frames as shown in Figures 2A and S2, including genes encoding the HR-PKS(cazF) and NR-PKS (cazM).To confirm the involvement of the caz cluster in the biosynthesis of 3\u20137, gene inactivationof the NR-PKS cazM was accomplished via a fusion PCR gene targeting cassette (FigureS3).16 The \u0394cazM inactivation completely abolished production of the azaphilones.Inactivation of the HR-PKS cazF also completely abolished production of 3\u20137 without therecovery of any pyrano-quinone intermediates, suggesting an essential role of both CazMand CazF in the synthesis of the northern portion of 3\u20137. This is consistent with thecollaborative mode of interaction between the two IPKSs, in which the 4-methyl-hex-2-enoate 9 is the most likely product synthesized by CazF and is transferred to CazM via theStarter-unit:ACP Transacylase (SAT) domain of CazM as a starter unit for further chainelongation (Figure 3). In this model, the NR-PKS is unable to produce any polyketideproduct in the absence of the starter unit.17To further confirm this mode of interaction between the two caz IPKSs, we inactivated theacyltransferase cazE that may be involved in connecting the northern and southern portionsof 3\u20137. We reasoned that inactivation of cazE should therefore have no effect on theWinter et al.Page 2J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 October 31.$w aterm ark-text $w aterm ark-text $w aterm ark-text sequential collaboration between CazM and CazF. Indeed, the \u0394cazE mutant was unable toproduce 3\u20137 and instead accumulated an intermediate 8 with UV absorbance consistent withthat of a pyrano-quinone (Figure S4\u2013S7). The structure of 8 was elucidated by 1D and 2DNMR spectroscopy and named cazisochromene (Figure 2B). The structure of the reducedsubstituent in 8 is consistent with that of 3, 5 and 6, further confirming 8 is an authenticintermediate in the caz pathway. However, the 12-hydroxyl derivative of 8 could not bedetected in the culture suggesting that the hydroxyl moiety present in 4 and 7 at this positionmay be installed by post-PKS oxygenases from the caz cluster rather than formed fromincomplete reduction by the HR-PKS CazF. This hypothesis is supported by monitoring thetime-course of metabolite production and observing that the amount of 3 dramaticallydecreased while 4 increased over time (Figure S8).With 8 in hand, we propose the biosynthetic pathway of 3\u20137 as shown in Figure 3.Following transfer of 9 from CazF to CazM, the polyketide is elongated four additionalrounds and methylated once to form the heptaketide intermediate 10. While tethered to theACP, 10 undergoes a Product Template (PT) domain-mediated regioselective cyclization viaa C2\u2013C7 aldol condensation followed by reductive release to form the benzaldehyde 11.18,19Chlorination of the aromatic ring catalyzed by the halogenase CazI followed by ahydroxylation-catalyzed annulation at C75,20 by the predicted monooxygenase CazL wouldthen give rise to 8. Given that the caz cluster only contains two IPKSs instead of the initiallyhypothesized three, either CazF or CazM must provide the additional southern triketidefragment. We propose that CazF could act as a dual functioning IPKS in that it not onlysupplies the reduced triketide 9 for CazM, but also a more oxidized intermediate such as 12for CazE (Figure 3). Following CazE-catalyzed acylation, intramolecular aldol condensationof the newly formed \u03b2-keto ester yields 3. Further modification of 3 through reduction(3\u21926), lactone cleavage and rearrangement, and C12 oxidation furnishes products 4\u20137.To test the involvement of CazF and CazE in converting 8 into 3, both enzymes were clonedand expressed from heterologous hosts for in vitro reconstitution. CazE (54 kDa) wassolubly expressed as a N-terminal octahistidine-tagged protein from Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)/pJW07637.21 CazF was solubly expressed as a C-terminal hexahistidine-taggedprotein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA/pJW07638.22, Both proteins werepurified to near homogeneity with yields of 52 mg/L and 9.5 mg/L, respectively (FiguresS9\u2013S11). The minimal PKS activity of CazF was evaluated by incubating the enzyme with 2mM malonyl-CoA. Treating the reaction mixture with 1 M NaOH (base hydrolysis)followed by LC-MS analysis of the organic extract showed production of the triacetic acidlactone 13 (Figure 4A), which is formed from the spontaneous enolization and cyclization ofthe unreduced triketide.17,23 Intriguingly, in the absence of base hydrolysis, significantlylower levels of 13 were detected, indicating the triketide may be fixed in an extendedconformation by CazF to prevent lactonization and release. However, when CazE was addedto the reaction, comparable levels of 13 to that of the base hydrolyzed reaction wereproduced (Figure S12). These results suggested a likely interaction between CazE and CazF,in which a conformational change in CazF after interacting with CazE may cause theunreduced triketide to be exposed to the aqueous environment and results in its subsequentlactonization and release.We next examined the tailoring domains of CazF. The activity of the MT domain wasassessed by adding 2 mM S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to CazF together with malonyl-CoA. Following incubation and base hydrolysis, a dimethylated \u03b1-pyrone 14 (Figure 4A)was isolated, which matched to that of a synthetically prepared standard (Figure S13\u201314).24The formation of 14 is indicative of the correct timing of the MT domain followingformation of diketide intermediates on CazF, which is required for the formation of both 9and 12. To assay the functions of the KR, DH and ER domains, acetoacetyl-SNAC wasWinter et al.Page 3J Am Chem Soc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 October 31.$w aterm ark-text $w aterm ark-text $w aterm ark-text incubated with CazF and NADPH. LC-MS analysis of the organic extract showedaccumulation of 3-hydroxybutanoyl-SNAC and butyryl-SNAC, confirming that all reductivedomains were functional for the purified enzyme (Figure S15).After confirming all of the domains of CazF were catalytically active, we attempted tosynthesize 3 from 8. Equimolar amounts of CazF and CazE were incubated with 8, NADPH,SAM and malonyl-CoA. LC-MS analysis of the organic extract revealed the formation of anew product; whose retention time, UV profile and isotopic mass ratio were identical to 3(Figure 4B). When either CazF or CazE was omitted from the reaction, the formation of 3could not be detected. Additionally, when only malonyl-CoA was added to the reaction orwhen NADPH was omitted, no new product formation could be detected. However, whenonly SAM was omitted from the reaction, a new product with a shorter retention time than 3and loss of a methyl group by mass was detected from the in vitro assay. Based on theseobservations, we assigned this product to be 4'-desmethyl-chaetoviridin A (15). Therefore,the in vitro reactions unequivocally confirmed the involvement of the HR-PKS in providingthe southern portion of the fragment in 3\u20137, as well as providing another example of anacyltransferase-mediated convergent synthesis of fungal polyketides.25 The requirement ofNADPH to produce the chaetoviridins suggest that CazE may possess substrate specificitytowards a triketide reduced at the \u03b4 position; while the formation of 13 in the absence ofSAM indicates methylation at the \u03b3 position is not essential.In summary, we have identified and characterized the caz biosynthetic cluster that isresponsible for the production of the chaetoviridin and chaetomugilin azaphilones from C.globosum. Through in vivo gene inactivation experiments, we established that the HR-PKSCazF most likely supplies a highly reduced methylated triketide product such as 9 to theNR-PKS CazM. Since CazM cannot be solubly expressed at this point, we can not excludethe possibility that CazF transfers a polyketide product of different length to CazM as astarter unit. Additionally, through in vitro reconstitution experiments with theacyltransferase CazE, we established that CazF can also produce a more oxidized triketideproduct 12 that is transacylated by CazE to a pyrano-quinone intermediate 8 to afford 3.Hence, CazF serves the unprecedented dual functions in completing the biosynthesis of apolyketide product. The timing of substrate transfer from CazF, whether it is 9 or 12, mustbe precisely orchestrated by the two interacting acyltrasferases in the form of thefreestanding CazE and the SAT domain of CazM. Our work therefore unveils a new level ofprogramming complexity among the fungal PKSs.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Acknowledgments J.M.W. is supported by a L'Or\u00e9al USA Fellowship for Women in Science.

This is consistent with thecollaborative mode of interaction between the two IPKSs, in which the 4-methyl-hex-2-enoate 9 is the most likely product synthesized by CazF and is transferred to CazM via theStarter-unit:ACP Transacylase (SAT) domain of CazM as a starter unit for further chainelongation (Figure 3). In this model, the NR-PKS is unable to produce any polyketideproduct in the absence of the starter",

        "sequential collaboration between CazM and CazF. Indeed, the \u0394cazE mutant was unable toproduce 3\u20137 and instead accumulated an intermediate 8 with UV absorbance consistent withthat of a pyrano-quinone (Figure S4\u2013S7). The structure of 8 was elucidated by 1D and 2DNMR spectroscopy and named cazisochromene (Figure 2B). The structure of the reducedsubstituent in 8 is consistent with that of 3, 5 and 6, further confirming 8 is an authenticintermediate in the caz pathway. However, the 12-hydroxyl derivative of 8 could not bedetected in the culture suggesting that the hydroxyl moiety present in 4 and 7 at this positionmay be installed by post-PKS oxygenases from the caz cluster rather than formed fromincomplete reduction by the HR-PKS CazF. This hypothesis is supported by monitoring thetime-course of metabolite production and observing that the amount of 3 dramaticallydecreased while 4 increased over time (Figure",
        "S8).With 8 in hand, we propose the biosynthetic pathway of 3\u20137 as shown in Figure 3.Following transfer of 9 from CazF to CazM, the polyketide is elongated four additionalrounds and methylated once to form the heptaketide intermediate 10. While tethered to theACP, 10 undergoes a Product Template (PT) domain-mediated regioselective cyclization viaa C2\u2013C7 aldol condensation followed by reductive release to form the benzaldehyde 11.18,19Chlorination of the aromatic ring catalyzed by the halogenase CazI followed by ahydroxylation-catalyzed annulation at C75,20 by the predicted monooxygenase CazL wouldthen give rise to 8. Given that the caz cluster only contains two IPKSs instead of the initiallyhypothesized three, either CazF or CazM must provide the additional southern triketidefragment. We propose that CazF could act as a dual functioning IPKS in that it not onlysupplies the reduced triketide 9 for CazM, but also a more oxidized intermediate such as 12for CazE (Figure 3). Following CazE-catalyzed acylation, intramolecular aldol condensationof the newly formed \u03b2-keto ester yields 3. Further modification of 3 through reduction(3\u21926), lactone cleavage and rearrangement, and C12 oxidation furnishes products",
        "4\u20137.To test the involvement of CazF and CazE in converting 8 into 3, both enzymes were clonedand expressed from heterologous hosts for in vitro reconstitution. CazE (54 kDa) wassolubly expressed as a N-terminal octahistidine-tagged protein from Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)/pJW07637.21 CazF was solubly expressed as a C-terminal hexahistidine-taggedprotein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA/pJW07638.22, Both proteins werepurified to near homogeneity with yields of 52 mg/L and 9.5 mg/L, respectively (FiguresS9\u2013S11). The minimal PKS activity of CazF was evaluated by incubating the enzyme with 2mM malonyl-CoA. Treating the reaction mixture with 1 M NaOH (base hydrolysis)followed by LC-MS analysis of the organic extract showed production of the triacetic acidlactone 13 (Figure 4A), which is formed from the spontaneous enolization and cyclization ofthe unreduced triketide.17,23 Intriguingly, in the absence of base hydrolysis, significantlylower levels of 13 were detected, indicating the triketide may be fixed in an extendedconformation by CazF to prevent lactonization and release. However, when CazE was addedto the reaction, comparable levels of 13 to that of the base hydrolyzed reaction wereproduced (Figure S12). These results suggested a likely interaction between CazE and CazF,in which a conformational change in CazF after interacting with CazE may cause theunreduced triketide to be exposed to the aqueous environment and results in its subsequentlactonization and",
        "release.We next examined the tailoring domains of CazF. The activity of the MT domain wasassessed by adding 2 mM S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to CazF together with malonyl-CoA. Following incubation and base hydrolysis, a dimethylated \u03b1-pyrone 14 (Figure 4A)was isolated, which matched to that of a synthetically prepared standard (Figure S13\u201314).24The formation of 14 is indicative of the correct timing of the MT domain followingformation of diketide intermediates on CazF, which is required for the formation of both 9and 12.

        "S15).After confirming all of the domains of CazF were catalytically active, we attempted tosynthesize 3 from 8. Equimolar amounts of CazF and CazE were incubated with 8, NADPH,SAM and malonyl-CoA. LC-MS analysis of the organic extract revealed the formation of anew product; whose retention time, UV profile and isotopic mass ratio were identical to 3(Figure 4B). When either CazF or CazE was omitted from the reaction, the formation of 3could not be detected. Additionally, when only malonyl-CoA was added to the reaction orwhen NADPH was omitted, no new product formation could be detected. However, whenonly SAM was omitted from the reaction, a new product with a shorter retention time than 3and loss of a methyl group by mass was detected from the in vitro assay. Based on theseobservations, we assigned this product to be 4'-desmethyl-chaetoviridin A (15). Therefore,the in vitro reactions unequivocally confirmed the involvement of the HR-PKS in providingthe southern portion of the fragment in 3\u20137, as well as providing another example of anacyltransferase-mediated convergent synthesis of fungal polyketides.25 The requirement ofNADPH to produce the chaetoviridins suggest that CazE may possess substrate specificitytowards a triketide reduced at the \u03b4 position; while the formation of 13 in the absence ofSAM indicates methylation at the \u03b3 position is not",
        "essential.In summary, we have identified and characterized the caz biosynthetic cluster that isresponsible for the production of the chaetoviridin and chaetomugilin azaphilones from C.globosum. Through in vivo gene inactivation experiments, we established that the HR-PKSCazF most likely supplies a highly reduced methylated triketide product such as 9 to theNR-PKS CazM. Since CazM cannot be solubly expressed at this point, we can not excludethe possibility that CazF transfers a polyketide product of different length to CazM as astarter unit. Additionally, through in vitro reconstitution experiments with theacyltransferase CazE, we established that CazF can also produce a more oxidized triketideproduct 12 that is transacylated by CazE to a pyrano-quinone intermediate 8 to afford 3.Hence, CazF serves the unprecedented dual functions in completing the biosynthesis of apolyketide product. The timing of substrate transfer from CazF, whether it is 9 or 12, mustbe precisely orchestrated by the two interacting acyltrasferases in the form of thefreestanding CazE and the SAT domain of CazM. Our work therefore unveils a new level ofprogramming complexity among the fungal",
