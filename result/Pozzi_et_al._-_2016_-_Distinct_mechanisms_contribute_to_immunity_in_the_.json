Abstract The investigation of self-resistance in antibiotic pro-ducers is important to understand the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens and to improve anti-biotic production. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthe-sized antibiotics that mostly target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The actinomycete Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which interferes with peptidoglycan biosynthesis by binding bactoprenol-pyrophosphate-coupled peptidoglycan precursors. In order to understand how Microbispora counteracts the action of its own antibiotic, its peptidoglycan composition was analysed in detail. Microbispora peptidoglycan consists of muropeptides with D-Ala and Gly in similar proportion at the fourth position of the peptide stems and alternative 3-3 cross-links besides the classical 4-3 cross-links. In addition, the NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb) was ana-lysed for the expression of immunity proteins. We show that distinct immunity determinants are encoded in the mlb cluster: the ABC transporter MlbYZ acting cooperatively with the transmembrane protein MlbJ and the lipoprotein MlbQ. NMR structural analysis of MlbQ revealed a hydrophobic surface patch, which is proposed to bind the cognate lantibiotic. This study demonstrates that immunity in Microbispora is not only based on one determinant but on the action of the distinct immunity proteins MlbQ, MlbYZ and MlbJ. Introduction The development of antibiotic resistance in clinically rel-evant pathogens is one major obstacle to effective treat-ment of bacterial infections and the main reason for the urgent need of new therapeutic strategies.Among the most exploited classes of antibiotics used against Gram-positive bacteria, beta (\u03b2)-lactams and glycopeptides have played a predominant role in antibiotic chemotherapy. Their wide-spread use has led to the emergence of resistant patho-genic bacteria, and several mechanisms conferring resistance have been well documented (Rice, 2012). Both \u03b2-lactams and glycopeptides are cell wall-targeting antibi-otics which interfere with the peptidoglycan biosynthesis, an essential process in viable cells. Peptidoglycan (PG) is a polymer that surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane pre-serving the cell integrity from the turgor and maintaining the cell shape. It consists of linear glycan chains of repeated N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid disaccharide units (GlcNAc-MurNAc) that are interconnected by peptide cross-links. The key component of PG synthesis is lipid II which consists of the disaccharide GlcNAc-MurNAc loaded onto the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate and linked to a pentapeptide, typically L-Ala-\u03b3-D-Glu-X-D-Ala-D-Ala, where X is meso-A2pm (2,6-diaminopimelic acid) or L-Lys. After the synthesis in the cytoplasm, lipid II is translocated and exposed to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane where it is incorporated in the nascent glycan chains by transglycosylases and pro-cessed by transpeptidases which cross-link the peptide side-chains of adjacent glycan strands (Vollmer et al., 2008). Diversification of the PG assembly pathway leading to \u03b2-lactam and glycopeptide resistance had been widely described. The expression of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) with low affinity to \u03b2-lactams and the synthesis of glycopeptide-resistant PG precursors with pentapeptides Received 20 February, 2015; revised 24 April, 2015; accepted 25 April, 2015.

Moreover, L,D-transpeptidases confer resistance both to \u03b2-lactams and glycopeptides by bypass-ing the \u03b2-lactam sensitive D,D-transpeptidase activity of PBPs and using tetrapeptide acyl donors devoid of the target of glycopeptides respectively (Mainardi et al., 2005; 2008). Despite the emergence of resistance to these two classes of antibiotics, PG biosynthesis remains an effec-tive target for the development of new antibacterial strate-gies. The PG precursor lipid II, the bottleneck of cell wall synthesis, is the target not only of glycopeptides but also of lantibiotics, mannopeptimycins and ramoplanin (Breukink and de Kruijff, 2006). Lantibiotics are attractive drug can-didates due to their potency and broad-spectrum activity. A few lantibiotics are currently in preclinical development or in clinical trials for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (Jabes et al., 2011; Crowther et al., 2013; Sandiford, 2015). Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides which display anti-microbial activity. According to the new nomenclature, lantibiotics are classified into the lanthipeptide family, which comprises lanthionine-containing peptides regard-less of their biological activities (Arnison et al., 2013). Lanthipeptides are characterized by the presence of the thioether-cross-linked amino acids lanthionine (Lan) and 3-methyl-lanthionine (MeLan) that are required for activity and confer protease resistance to the mature product. The cross-linked amino acids are formed by dehydration of serine or threonine residues and intramolecular addition of a cysteinyl thiol to the resulting dehydroamino acids (Knerr and van der Donk, 2012). Lanthipeptides are clas-sified into four classes according to the biosynthetic enzymes that introduce the Lan and MeLan motifs. The most extensively studied lantibiotic, nisin, belongs to the class I lanthipeptides, which are modified by the two dis-tinct enzymes LanB (dehydratase) and LanC (cyclase). Class I lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters encode the precursor peptide and the enzymes involved in lanthionines formation, transporters, proteases, modifying enzymes, regulators and immunity proteins (Willey and van der Donk, 2007). Many of the lantibiotics display their antibacterial activity by binding the PG precursor lipid II, and therefore interfering with the PG biosynthesis (Broetz et al., 1998; Bierbaum and Sahl, 2009). In addition, nisin can permeabilize bacterial membranes by lipid II-dependent pore formation and cause the dissipation of the membrane potential and rapid efflux of small metabo-lites (Wiedemann et al., 2001). Lantibiotic producers express immunity proteins like ABC transporters, lipoproteins, membrane-associated peptides and transmembrane proteins as a measure of self-protection (Okuda and Sonomoto, 2011). However, despite the expression of immunity proteins, lantibiotic-producer strains do not exhibit a full resistance, and the susceptibility to their own products may reflect the efficacy of these antibacterials. Indeed, lantibiotic autotoxicity has represented an obstacle for the improvement of fermentation processes (Valsesia et al., 2007). In many antibiotic-producing bacteria, antibiotic resistance is mediated by ABC transporters, which export the drugs through the cytoplasmic membrane (Mendez and Salas, 2001). As lantibiotics interact with lipid II located on the cell surface, ABC transporters involved in lantibiotic immu-nity should have another mechanism. A cell-based trans-port assay reported for EpiEFG showed that this ABC transporter system can extrude the membrane-bound epidermin to the extracellular space, decreasing the con-centration of the lantibiotic in the lipid II immediate envi-ronment (Otto et al., 1998). In contrast to the epidermin cluster (epi), the nisin (nis) and subtilin (spa) gene clusters encode the lipoproteins NisI and SpaI that confer immu-nity to the producers in addition to the ABC transporters NisFEG and SpaFEG, homologues of EpiEFG. The lantibiotics nisin and subtilin have similar structures; however, the corresponding immunity lipoproteins NisI and SpaI do not show any sequence similarity and they do not confer cross-immunity. Although the expression of these genes in surrogate hosts clearly showed an involve-ment in immunity (Stein et al., 2003; 2005), their mecha-nism of action on a molecular level is still largely unknown. NAI-107 is a lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024, active against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylo-coccus aureus, glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and some Gram-negative bacteria (Lazzarini et al., 2006; Castiglione et al., 2008). Because of its interesting antibacterial profile and potent antibacterial activity, NAI-107 is currently in the preclinical development for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens (Jabes et al., 2011; Lepak et al., 2015). NAI-107 inhibits PG biosynthesis and affects the bacterial membrane by slow depolarization (Muench et al., 2014). Macromolecular synthesis, whole-cell and enzyme assays combined with proteomic profiling showed that NAI-107 targets lipid II but it does not display a pore-forming activity (Muench et al., 2014), as previously described for nisin. NAI-107, also called microbisporicin, was the first discovered class I lantibiotic produced by actinomycetes. It includes one methyl-lanthionine, three lanthionines and two unusual lantibiotic modifications: a chlorinated tryptophan and a mono-or dihydroxylated proline (Lee, 2003; Castiglione et al., 2008). The N-terminal lanthionine rings (1-11 amino acids) resemble the lipid II-binding motif of nisin (Hsu et al., 2004), whereas the C-terminal aminovinyl cysteine is also found in epidermin (Allgaier et al., 1985). In addition to Lantibiotic immunity in Microbispora 119 \u00a9 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 18, 118\u2013132 14622920, 2016, 1, Dow nloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/1462-2920.12892 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Cham paign, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

Recently, the congeners of the NAI-107 complex produced by Microbispora PTA-5024 and M. corallina NRRL 30420 were characterized (Maffioli et al., 2014). The genes responsible for the biosynthesis of microbisporicin were widely described in the producer M. corallina NRRL 30420 (Foulston and Bibb, 2010). The mib cluster encodes two enzymes not described before in lantibiotic gene clusters: a cytochrome P450 (MibO) and a flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenase (MibH) involved in hydroxylation of proline and chlorination of tryptophan respectively Furthermore, the cluster encodes three puta-tive ABC transporters (MibYZ, MibTU, MibEF), a predicted lipoprotein (MibQ) and a transmembrane protein of unknown function (MibJ). Recently, the draft genome sequence of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 was published (Sosio et al., 2014). The screening of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 genome revealed the presence of a gene cluster with high similarity to the mib cluster, named mlb cluster (Donadio et al., 2009). Although NAI-107 was tested in several in vitro studies against multi-drug-resistant pathogens, no resistant mutants were observed. The analysis of NAI-107 resist-ance in Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 was therefore con-ducted to determine the mechanisms evolved in the producer strain to protect itself from NAI-107 and predict possible resistance mechanisms in pathogenic bacteria. We used two different approaches to study Microbispora immunity: a detailed analysis of the PG, target of NAI-107 and the investigation of resistance determinants encoded in the NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb). In particu-lar, we analysed the immunity lipoprotein MlbQ and solved the structure of MlbQ by NMR. This study repre-sents the first comprehensive analysis of immunity in a lantibiotic-producing actinomycete. Results and discussion The identification of 3-3-cross-linked muropeptides in Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 suggests the action of L,D-transpeptidases in peptidoglycan synthesis The lantibiotic NAI-107 interferes with the late stages of PG biosynthesis by binding the bactoprenol-pyrophosphate coupled PG precursors (Muench et al., 2014). In order to investigate possible PG modifications responsible for the protection of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 from NAI-107, a detailed PG structural analysis was performed combining high performance liquid chromatog-raphy, mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The structure of muropeptide monomers was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2 and MS3). Mass spectrometry analyses of mutanolysin digested PG from exponentially growing bacteria (72 h) revealed the presence of muropeptide monomers and dimers with a structural variability (Fig. 1, Table 1). Besides the presence of pentapeptides (8) (pentapeptide = GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-\u03b3-D-iGln-meso-A2pm-D-Ala-D-Ala), tripeptides (1) and tetrapeptides (7) peptides were detected (Fig. 1, Table 1). The muropeptide monomers from Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 were fully amidated at Glu2 (Table 1). Furthermore, monomeric tetrapeptides ending in Gly instead of Ala were detected (Fig. 1; Table 1; Fig. S1). 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 1,2 3 5 6 8 7 4 9 10 11a 11b 12a 12b 13a 14a 14b 13b RetenNoneon Noneme (min)Io n in te ns ity (x 10 9 ) 1.0 80 Fig. 1.

See the Term s and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com /term s-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Com m ons License The presence of Gly in the monomer tetrapeptide 3 at m/z 927.4 is presumably the result of a modification that occurs in the late stages of PG maturation, since no UDP-linked PG precursors containing Gly in the fourth position of the peptide were detected in Microbispora. Tetrapeptides ending in D-Ser (2) (Fig. 1,Table 1) were also detected in Microbispora PG, though in minor amounts.The exchange of D-Ala4 for Gly or other D-amino acids is known to occur as a side reaction of L,D-transpeptidases, \u03b2-lactam-resistant enzymes first described in Enterococcus faecium, where they cross-link the PG using tetrapeptides as acyl donor (Mainardi et al., 2005). The presence of several genes in the Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 genome (Sosio et al., 2014) that encode putative L,D-transpeptidases may explain the ability of Microbispora to substitute D-Ala4 for Gly or D-Ser in monomer tetrapeptides. The modifications described for the muropeptide mono-mers could also be detected for the dimers, which contain Ala (13, 14), Gly (10, 12) or Ser (9, 11) in the fourth or fifth position of the acceptor peptides (Fig. 1, Table 1). Accord-ing to the m/z values, muropeptides with 4-3 cross-links resulting from a D,D-transpeptidase activity were sug-gested (Table 1). Interestingly, the structure of the dimers 9 and 10 could be explained exclusively by the presence of 3-3 cross-links rather than 4-3 cross-links. Dimers with a disaccharide tripeptide as acyl donor were in fact con-sidered to contain direct 3-3 cross-links. Moreover, the presence of two isomers (a and b) for the muropeptides at m/z 1879.9, 1849.9, 1792.8 and 1863.8 (11, 12, 13 and 14) may be the result of the two cross-link types (Fig. 1, Table 1). The modifications found in muropeptide mono-mers and dimers suggest the action of both D,D-and L,D-transpeptidases in Microbispora PG cross-linking and remodelling. The activity of L,D-transpeptidases was previously reported for some members of the order Actinomycetales (Lavollay et al., 2008; Hugonnet et al., 2014) but not described before for lantibiotic producers. The non-producer strains Microbispora RP0 and Microbispora JCM 10266 exhibit the same muropeptides as the NAI-107 producer Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 To determine if the PG composition of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 is linked to NAI-107 production, a non-producer strain was constructed. Since Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 is not genetically accessible, a gene transfer system had to be developed. DNA transfer could be achieved by using a conjugation protocol based on the methylation-proficient donor Escherichia coli S17-1, apramycin for the selection of Microbispora ex-conjugants and phospho-mycin for the inhibition of E. coli (see Experimental procedures). The non-producer strain Microbispora RP0 was obtained by disruption of the NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb) by integration of the plasmid pGusA21-mlbAB. The \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter system allowed an easy identification of recombinant clones car-rying the plasmid (see Experimental procedures). Using bioassays and high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013 mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis, we proved that the mutant Microbispora RP0 does not produce any NAI-107. The PG of Microbispora RP0 was isolated at 72 h and was analysed by HPLC. The HPLC profile of Microbispora RP0 muropeptides at 72 h was similar to that of the wild type (WT) (Fig. S2). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of the same PG modifica-tions (data not shown). Thus, the PG composition of Microbispora RP0 suggested a PG structure that is inde-pendent from NAI-107 production. To determine if the variability of PG muropeptides is characteristic of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024, we analysed the PG of Microbispora JCM 10266, a Microbispora sp. that pro-duces neither the lantibiotic NAI-107 nor any other antibacterial compound. Analysis of Microbispora JCM 10266 PG by mass spectrometry did not show any significant difference to the PG of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 (data not shown). The PG modifications found in Microbispora spp. seemed to be an intrinsic chara-cteristic of Microbispora genus, rather than a mecha-nism of NAI-107 resistance. Peptidoglycan remodelling in Table 1. Proposed structure of the muropeptides from Microbispora Microbispora could be a general attempt to counteract the action of cell wall-targeting antibiotics produced by soil-dwelling bacteria. The mlb cluster encodes resistance determinants The occurrence of the same PG structure in the NAI-107 producer and in non-producing Microbispora strains excludes target modification as a specific mechanism of self-protection against NAI-107. To analyse the NAI-107 immunity mechanisms in the producer strain Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024, we first compared its resistance level to that of Microbispora JCM 10266 by bioassays. Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 was considerably more resistant to NAI-107 than the non-producer strain Microbispora JCM 10266 (Fig. 2), which does not contain the mlb cluster (Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 MIC 0.5\u2013 1 \u03bcg ml-1, Microbispora JCM 10266 MIC 0.1 \u03bcg ml-1). Thus, the difference in resistance between the two Microbispora spp. is presumably due to the action of immunity proteins encoded in the NAI-107 gene cluster (mlb). Bioinformatic analysis of the mlb cluster led to the identification of the putative immunity proteins MlbQ, MlbYZ, MlbTU and MlbEF. MlbQ is a lipoprotein of 129 amino acids with a conserved lipobox (LAGC) containing a cysteine, which presumably becomes the N-terminal residue of the mature protein (amino acids 24\u2013129) after lipidation and cleavage of the signal peptide. MlbYZ, MlbTU, MlbEF are putative ABC transporters which are composed of a permease (MlbY, MlbU, MlbE) and an ATPase (MlbZ, MlbT, MlbF) that probably assemble as tetramers of two heterodimers. To assess the role of these proteins in NAI-107 resistance, mlbQ, mlbYZ, mlbTU and mlbEF were heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M145. The genes were cloned into the integrative plasmid pRM4 under the control of the constitutive promoter ermE*p and resistance assays against NAI-107 were per-formed. Streptomyces coelicolor M145 expressing the lipoprotein MlbQ was more resistant to NAI-107 than the WT (Fig. 3A). To confirm the result, mlbQ was expressed in Microbispora JCM 10266, a closely related strain of the NAI-107 producer. MlbQ conferred NAI-107 resistance also to this strain (data not shown). In contrast to MlbQ, none of the ABC transporters encoded in the mlb cluster conferred NAI-107 protection in S. coelicolor (Fig. 3B). This is in contrast to the experiments described for the MlbEF homologues MibEF and PspEF for which a role in immunity was reported. MibEF and PspEF are ABC transporters encoded in the microbisporicin and planosporicin clusters from the actinomycete species Microbispora corallina and Planomonospora alba respec-tively (Foulston and Bibb, 2010; Sherwood et al., 2013). The ABC transporter MlbYZ and the transmembrane protein MlbJ confer immunity to NAI-107 cooperatively Several ABC transporters of antimicrobial peptides are functional in association with accessory proteins whose mechanism of action is mostly unknown (Gebhard, 2012). To determine whether any of the ABC transporters in the mlb cluster is involved in resistance by acting in cooperation with another protein, we performed coexpression studies. MlbYZ, MlbTU, MlbEF were coexpressed in the heterologous host S. coelicolor M145 Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024Microbispora JCM 10266Fig. 2.

The stop codon of mlbJ overlaps with the start codon of mlbY suggesting an operon organization of the genes mlbJ, mlbY and mlbZ. mlbJ was cloned into the integrative plasmid pIJ10257 (hygR) under the control of the constitutive promoter ermE*p. pIJ10257 containing mlbJ was transferred to S. coelicolor harbouring one of the recombinant plasmids pRM4-mlbYZ, pRM4-mlbTU and pRM4-mlbEF (apraR) respectively. The recombinant S. coelicolor strains were tested against NAI-107 to determine a possible synergis-tic effect of the expressed proteins. MlbJ conferred resistance only in the coexpression with MlbYZ (Fig. 4). The cooperative action of MlbJ and MlbYZ suggested a role of MlbJ as substrate-binding protein. The expression of MlbJ alone conferred a low resistance to NAI-107, probably by intercepting the lantibiotic from the extracellular space. MlbJ contains several predicted membrane-spanning regions (SOSUI ver. 1.11; Hirokawa et al., 1998). According to its hydrophobicity profile and function, we propose that MlbJ is functionally analogous to the LanH family of proteins. LanH proteins are acces-sory proteins that act with the immunity ABC transporters LanFEG (Okuda and Sonomoto, 2011). One of the best-characterized LanH proteins is NukH, a transmembrane protein from Staphylococcus warneri. NukH recognizes the lantibiotic nukacin ISK-1 and transfers it to the ABC transporter NukFEG, which then pumps the lantibiotic to the extracellular space in an energy-dependent manner (Okuda et al., 2008). The coexpression of MlbJ with MlbTU and MlbEF did not confer NAI-107 resistance. In the microbisporin cluster, the genes encoding the ABC transporter MibTU are co-transcribed together with the genes mibBCDTUV (Foulston and Bibb, 2010). Since the gene organization in the mlb gene cluster is identical, the same transcriptional unit can be supposed. Therefore, a role of MlbTU as exporter was speculated. The deletion of the mlbEF homologous gene mibEF from the micro-bisporicin gene cluster resulted in markedly delayed and greatly reduced levels of microbisporicin production. Therefore, the authors speculated that MibEF is either involved in immunity or in lantibiotic export (Foulston and Bibb, 2010). The lipoprotein MlbQ confers resistance specifically to NAI-107-like lantibiotics Since it is known that lipoproteins often act as substrate binding proteins of ABC transporters in Gram-positive bacteria, MlbQ was tested in coexpression experiments with the ABC transporters encoded in the mlb cluster, as reported for the coexpression of mlbJ. The resistance assays against NAI-107 did not show any difference between S. coelicolor M145 expressing an ABC trans-porter alone or in combination with MlbQ (data not shown). The coexpression with the ABC transporters did not increase the immunity effect of MlbQ. Therefore, we assumed an MlbQ mode of action independent of the ABC transporters MlbYZ, MlbTU and MlbEF. To explore the specificity of MlbQ-mediated resistance, S. coelicolor pRM4-mlbQ was tested against the lantibiotic 97518. 97518, also called planosporicin, is an NAI-107-like lantibiotic that has an identical arrangement of thioether rings to NAI-107 and a similar antibacterial spec-trum, but is considerably less potent than NAI-107 (Maffioli et al., 2009). Recently, the elucidation of the 3D structure of NAI-107 and 97518 in solution by NMR underlined the conformational differences between the two related lantibiotics, which might be responsible for the significant difference in potency (Vasile et al., 2011). MlbQ cross-resistance to 97518 was determined by filter disc assay. S. coelicolor pRM4-mlbQ was grown on a Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) agar plate where a sterile filter disc soaked with 20 \u03bcg of 97518 was applied. Streptomyces coelicolor pRM4-mlbQ was more resistant against 97518 than the WT (Fig. 5A). The 97518 biosynthetic gene cluster encodes a lipopro-tein, named PlnQ (GenBank KM588197), which displays 62% amino acid identity to MlbQ. To further investigate the cross-resistance to the lantibiotics NAI-107 and 97518, PlnQ was expressed in S. coelicolor M145, and resistance S. c. M145 S. c. M145 pRM4NAI-107 (\u03bcgml-1) 0 2 S. c.

Lantibiotic immunity in Microbispora 123 \u00a9 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 18, 118\u2013132 14622920, 2016, 1, Dow nloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/1462-2920.12892 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Cham paign, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Term s and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com /term s-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Com m ons License assays were performed (see Experimental procedures). PlnQ conferred resistance to both NAI-107 and 97518 (Fig. 5A and B), as observed for the lipoprotein MlbQ. However, S. coelicolor pRM4-plnQ was less resistant against NAI-107 than S. coelicolor pRM4-mlbQ. Lantibiotic cross-resistance was previously reported for the membrane-associated proteins PepI and EciI encoded in the Pep5 and epicidin 280 lantibiotic clusters from Staphylococcus epidermidis 5 and S. epidermidis BN280 respectively (Heidrich et al., 1998). In contrast, cross-resistance was not observed for NisI, the lipoprotein encoded in the nisin gene cluster (nis). NisI did not confer resistance to subtilin, a lantibiotic with an identical organi-zation of the thioether rings (Stein et al., 2003). To confirm the specificity of MlbQ action against NAI-107-like lantibiotics, we tested S. coelicolor M145 pRM4-mlbQ against epidermin (Allgaier et al., 1985). Epidermin is a class I lantibiotic which presents an N-terminal nisin-like lipid II binding motif and a C-terminal aminovinyl cysteine. Epidermin differs from NAI-107 and 97518 in the central region where the flexible 12-15 amino acids are substi-tuted in NAI-107 by the ring C. S. coelicolor M145 express-ing MlbQ was not more resistant to epidermin than the WT (Fig. 5C). The resistance assays against 97518 and epidermin showed the specificity of MlbQ to NAI-107-like lantibiotics. MlbQ possesses a hydrophobic surface patch proposed to bind NAI-107 As MlbQ recognizes structurally related lantibiotics and no effect was observed against other antibiotics with the same target, we hypothesized a mode of action based on the direct interaction with the lantibiotic. To assess this, we purified an N-terminally His6-tagged fusion protein from E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) and determined the structure of MlbQ in solution by NMR spectroscopy (PDB 2MVO) (Fig. 6). MlbQ is divided into an unstructured N-terminal region followed by a globular domain (P55-G147). The domain is wedge shaped, consisting of a C-terminal helix (\u03b13) packed at an angle against a four-stranded \u03b2-sheet, with a disulphide bond connecting the helix to the sheet at its C-terminal end. This sheet has a simple meander topology, but features an unusual structured \u03b21-\u03b22 loop at the broad end of the wedge, including a short helix (\u03b13) that runs perpendicular to the sheet. A conserved trypto-phan residue (W77) anchors the loop into the hydrophobic core of the fold, while a short \u03b2-strand forms a bridge with the long loop between \u03b24 and \u03b13. This loop is largely unstructured, but begins with a short helix (\u03b12) that also runs perpendicular to the sheet, but in the opposite direc-tion to that in the \u03b21-\u03b22 loop. Three-dimensional (3D) structural comparisons using the DALI server (Holm and Rosenstr\u00f6m, 2010) found only limited similarity to known folds. The only significant simi-larity is to the IQ domain of Ras GTPase activating-like proteins (IQGAP2: Z-score 2.5, RMSD 2.5 \u00c5). This simi-larity is considerable over the \u03b2-meander, \u03b21-\u03b22 loop and C-terminal helix and includes an analogous \u03b2-bridge. The major differences are that in IQGAP2, the \u03b12 helix is longer and runs in the opposite direction, almost parallel to \u03b13, and the \u03b2-bridge forms part of a larger sheet, giving the fold a sandwich-like character. No sequence similarity between representatives of the IQGAP2 fold and MlbQ could be detected using sensitive profile-based methods. The only other lantibiotic immunity protein of known structure is SpaI from Bacillus subtilis (Christ et al., 2012).

However, it is proposed to bind its cognate lantibiotic, subtilin, via an extended hydrophobic patch on its surface. Looking for a similar feature on MlbQ, we located an analogous surface patch bounded by the \u03b21-\u03b22 loop, \u03b13, anda structured, conserved hydrophobic section of the N-terminal loop (P55-N64), which runs antiparallel to \u03b21 (Fig. 6). The extended shape of the patch and its length (\u223c16 \u00c5) are comparable to that in SpaI. Unfortu-nately, the low solubility of the lantibiotic in the NMR buffers precluded mapping of the potential interaction sites for SpaI (Christ et al., 2012), and similar problems were encountered for MlbQ. The extremely poor solubility of the lantibiotic in aqueous buffers also made alternative binding assays with CD or fluorescence spectroscopy impossible (data not shown). A Microbispora MlbQ null mutant is strongly impaired in growth in presence of NAI-107 To determine the effect of MlbQ-mediated immunity in the producer strain, we constructed the markerless deletion mutant \u0394mlbQ by homologous recombination of the two flanking regions, which were cloned in a non-replicative plasmid. Single and double cross-over events were iden-tified using the GUS reporter system (see Experimental procedures). Microbispora \u0394mlbQ was impaired in growth compared with the WT strain from start of NAI-107 pro-duction at 48 h (Fig. 7). To exclude that the observed phenotype is due to polar effects caused by the deletion of mlbQ, the mutant was complemented in trans by express-ing mlbQ under the control of the constitutive promoter ermE*p. The complemented mutant \u0394mlbQ(pRM4-mlbQ) revealed the same phenotype as the WT, demonstrating that the impaired growth of the mlbQ mutant is a conse-quence of mlbQ deletion. These observations confirmed that MlbQ is required for normal growth in the presence of NAI-107. Conclusions Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which interferes with PG biosynthesis by target-ing the bactoprenol-pyrophosphate coupled PG precur-sors. The PG of Microbispora exhibits muropeptides consisting of tripeptides, tetrapeptides, pentapeptides and different amino acids in the fourth and fifth position of the tetrapeptides and pentapeptides respectively. The presence of these muropeptides suggests the action of L,D-transpeptidases and D,D-carboxypeptidases in PG biosynthesis and remodelling. Both enzymes were described to play a crucial role in glycopeptide and \u03b2-lactam-resistance. Although PG modifications seem not to be responsible for NAI-107 resistance, we can speculate Fig. 6.

However, Microbispora possesses NAI-107 specific resistance determinants. The NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb) encodes two immunity mechanisms: the MlbJYZ complex and the lipoprotein MlbQ. We have shown that the ABC transporter MlbYZ confers resistance only together with the transmembrane protein MlbJ, which might act as a substrate-binding protein. The immunity lipoprotein MlbQ acts indepen-dently from MlbJYZ. The solution structure of MlbQ revealed an unstructured N-terminal region and a small, globular C-terminal domain. The domain has no similarity in sequence or structure to SpaI, the only lantibiotic-resistance protein of known structure. However, the pro-teins share a hydrophobic surface patch, which is proposed to bind the cognate lantibiotic. Experimental procedures Bacterial strains and plasmids Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Bullock et al., 1987) was used for cloning experiments, E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) (Novagen) for protein expression, E. coli ET12567 pUZ8002 (Kieser et al., 2000) and E. coli S17-1 (Simon et al., 1983) for intergenic conjugation with S. coelicolor and Microbispora spp. respec-tively. Microbispora JCM 10266 and the NAI-107 producer Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 were obtained from NAICONS (Milan). A strain and plasmid list is given in Table 2. Media and culture conditions Escherichia coli strains were grown and manipulated accord-ing to Sambrook and Russel, 2001. M9 minimal medium was used for 13C,15N-labeled protein expression in E. coli (Chen et al., 2006). Streptomyces coelicolor was cultivated and genetically manipulated as described in Kieser et al., 2000. Microbispora spp. were grown in GE82G medium (dextrose monohydrate 20 g l-1, maize dextrin 20 g l-1, soybean meal 15 g l-1, yeast extract 5 g l-1, CaCO3 1 g l-1, agar 1 g l-1, pH adjusted to 7.3) for the generation of biomass. 10 ml of medium were inoculated with 6% of a glycerol stock in a 100-ml baffled Erlenmeyer flask with a coiled spring baffle and incubated at 30\u00b0C and 180 r.p.m. in an orbital shaker. For a larger scale, a 4-day culture was used to inoculate (6% inoculum) 100 ml of medium in a 500-ml baffled Erlenmeyer flask with a coiled spring baffle. Microbispora spp. were streaked onto MV0.1 (dextrose monohydrate 0.1 g l-1, maize dextrin 2.4 g l-1, yeast extract 0.5 g l-1, meat extract 0.3 g l-1, tryptose 0.5 g l-1, agar 15 g l-1, pH adjusted to 7.2) and HA (malt extract 10 g l-1, yeast extract 4 g l-1, glucose 4 g l-1, CaCl2 1.46 g l-1, agar 18 g l-1) agar media. S1 agar medium (oatmeal 60 g l-1, agar 18 g l-1, FeSO4 \u00d7 7H2O 1 mg l-1, MnCl2 \u00d7 4H2O 1 mg l-1, ZnSO4 \u00d7 7H2O 1 mg l-1) was used for sporulation of Microbispora spp. Microbispora growth curve and NAI-107 susceptibility test For the generation of the biomass, Microbispora WT and the recombinant strains were grown in GE82G in two pre-cultures of 96 h and 72 h respectively. The second pre-culture was used to inoculate (6% inoculum) 100 ml of Evans medium (glucose 25 g l-1, NaH2PO4 10 mM, NaNO3 50 mM, FeSO4 \u00d7 7H2O 0.32 mM, MOPS 21 g l-1, KCl 10 mM, Na2SO4 2 mM, citric acid 2 mM, CaCl2 \u00d7 2H2O 0.25 mM, MgCl2 \u00d7 6H2O 1.25 mM, NaMoO4 \u00d7 2H2O 1 \u03bcg l-1, FeCl3 \u00d7 6H2O 1 mg l-1, MnCl2 \u00d7 4H2O 0.05 mg l-1, ZnCl2 0.2 mg l-1, CuCl2 \u00d7 2H2O 0.05 mg l-1, Na2B4O7 \u00d7 10H2O 0.05 mg l-1, (NH4)6Mo7O24 \u00d7 4H2O 0.05 mg l-1, pH adjusted to 6.5) in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask with a coiled spring baffle and incubated at 30\u00b0C and 180 r.p.m. in an orbital shaker. For the determination of the dry weight, 5 ml samples were taken at 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 96 h, 120 h, 144 h, 168 h, centrifuged and lyophilized. The NAI-107 susceptibility test was conducted using Micrococcus luteus as tester strain in LB agar (105 cfu ml-1). One to three microlitres of the supernatant of Microbispora cultures (120 h) were pipetted on sterile paper disks. For Microbispora WT always 2 \u03bcl were used, whereas for the recombinant strains the volume of the supernatant was adjusted to the dry weight of the cultures.As a reference, the dry weight of the wild type was set as 100%. Sterile paper discs were applied on M. luteus plates which were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. 0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0 50 100 150 200 h Microbispora WTMicrobispora \u0394mlbQ Microbispora \u0394mlbQ(pRM4-mlbQ)D ry  wei gh t (g) Fig. 7.

Harvested cells were boiled in SDS, washed several times with water and dis-rupted with a Precellys homogenizer. Cell walls were purified by digestion with 50 \u03bcg ml-1 RNase, 10 \u03bcg ml-1 DNase (2 h) and 100 \u03bcg ml-1 trypsin (18 h) and subsequently treated with 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF) (48 h) to remove teichoic acids. The isolated PG was digested with mutanolysin (18 h), and the released muropeptides were reduced with sodium borohydride. Muropeptides were separated by HPLC on an Agilent 1200 HPLC using a linear gradient of eluent A = 5% MeOH in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) and eluent B = 30% methanol in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 2.8) for 150 min (time in min: t0 = t5 = 0%B, t150 = 100%B, 0.5 ml min-1, 52\u00b0C) on a Prontosil 120 C18 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 3 \u03bcm, Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany). The injection volume was 100 \u03bcl. Muropeptides were detected at 205 nm. High-performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analyses of muropeptide samples were performed with an Agilent HPLC-ESI-MS system (LC/MSD Ultra Trap System XCT 6330, Waldbronn, Germany), using a linear gradient of eluent A = 0.1% formic acid in water and eluent B = 0.06% formic acid in methanol (time in min: t0 = t5 = 5%B, t155 = t180 = 30%B, 0.5 ml min-1, 52\u00b0C) on a Reprosil Gold 300 C18 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm ID, 5 \u03bcm, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch). The injec-tion volume was 90 \u03bcl. Detection of m/z values was con-ducted with AGILENT DATAANALYSIS for 6300 Series Ion Trap LC/MS 6.1 ver. 3.4 software (Bruker-Daltonik). MS2 and MS3 data were acquired with electrospray ionization in the positive mode. MS3 spectra (Fig. S1) were annotated using the soft-ware MMASS (Niedermeyer and Strohalm, 2012). Heterologous expression of putative immunity genes in S. coelicolor M145 mlbQ, mlbYZ, mlbTU, mlbEF, mlbJ and plnQ were amplified from the cosmids 1G6 (Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024) and 4B8 (Planomonospora DSM 14920) with the primers listed in Table 3 to yield 5\u2032 NdeI and 3\u2032 EcoRI sites, cloned into pJet1.2 (Fermentas) and confirmed by sequencing. The genes were subsequently cloned into pRM4 downstream the constitutive promoter ermE*p, and the respective plasmids were integrated at the \u03c6C31 site of S. coelicolor M145. Ex-conjugants were selected with 50 \u03bcg ml-1 apramycin and confirmed by colony PCR. Coexpression of MlbQ and MlbJ with the ABC transporters MlbYZ, MlbTU, MlbEF in S. coelicolor M145 mlbQ and mlbJ were amplified from the cosmid 1G6 (Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024) with the primers mlbQfor1/ mlbQrev2 and mlbJfor1/mlbJrev2 (Table 3) and cloned into pJet1.2 (Fermentas). Error-free clones were digested with NdeI/HindIII and cloned into pIJ10257 under the control of the constitutive promoter ermE*p yielding pIJ10257-mlbQ and pIJ10257-mlbJ. pIJ10257-mlbQ or pIJ10257-mlbJ was inte-Table 2.

Ex-conjugants were selected with 50 \u03bcg ml-1 apramycin, 50 \u03bcg ml-1 hygromycin and confirmed by colony PCR. Manipulation of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 and Microbispora JCM 10266 A protocol for conjugation between the DNA methylation pro-ficient E. coli S17-1 and Microbispora spp. was established. An aliquot (1 ml) of Microbispora glycerol stock was inoculated in 10 ml of nutrient broth medium (Difco).After 20 h, the culture was sonicated for 20 min in a water bath sonicator, the myce-lium recovered by centrifugation at 4270 g for 10 min, washed once with the medium and concentrated 1:10. E. coli S17-1 was grown overnight, washed twice with LB and re-suspended in 1/10 of the initial volume. 100 \u00b5l of Microbispora mycelium were mixed with 100 \u03bcl of E. coli, and the mixture was plated on MS medium containing 10 mM MgCl2 (Kieser et al., 2000). After 24 h of incubation at 30\u00b0C, each plate was overlaid with 1 ml water containing 1500 \u03bcg apramycin and 1250 \u03bcg phosphomycin. After about 10 days of incubation at 30\u00b0C, ex-conjugants were streaked onto HA plates containing 25 \u03bcg ml-1 apramycin and 50 \u03bcg ml-1 phosphomycin and checked by colony PCR. Construction of Microbispora recombinant strains To obtain the non-producer Microbispora RP0 strain, the mlb cluster was disrupted by single cross-over integration of the pGusA21-mlbAB plasmid containing the region from 34 672 bp to 36 222 bp (GenBank: AWEV00000000.1), which comprises part of the genes mlbA and mlbB encoding the precursor peptide and the dehydratase respectively (primers mlbAfor and mlbBrev, Table 3). The deletion mutant of mlbQ was generated by double cross-over of the plasmid pA18gus\u0394mlbQ containing a 1509 bp upstream fragment (EcoRI/BamHI) and a 1513 bp downstream fragment (BamHI/ HindIII) of mlbQ. The deletion vector pA18gus\u0394mlbQ was introduced into E. coli S17-1 by transformation and then con-jugated into Microbispora. The integration of pA18gus\u0394mlbQ by a single cross-over (apramycin resistant) was identified by GUS agar plate-based assay (Myronovskyi et al., 2011). Briefly, Microbispora recombinant clones were streaked onto MV0.1 agar plates and after 7 days incubation at 30\u00b0C overlaid with 1 mg ml-1 X-Gluc (Sigma). A \u0394mlbQ mutant was selected by screening colonies for the second cross-over (apramycin sensitive), and the correct gene deletion was confirmed by PCR. Lantibiotic resistance bioassay The resistance of S. coelicolor recombinant strains to the lantibiotics NAI-107 and epidermin was tested using the gra-dient plate technique (Szybalski and Bryson, 1952). Gradient plates (0\u20132 or 0\u20134 \u03bcg ml-1) were prepared as described below. Two layers of agar were poured successively into a squared plate (10 \u00d7 10 mm) to obtain a gradient from one side to the other. The desired volume of lantibiotic (final concentration of 2 or 4 \u03bcg ml-1) was added to 30 ml LB agar, which was poured into the plate. The plate was propped up using a 3 mm thick bar, just enough for the agar to cover the entire bottom. In this way, the agar formed a wedge that was shallow on one side and deep on the other side of the plate. After agar solidification, the plate was placed in a horizontal position, and 30 ml LB agar without lantibiotic was poured to have a homogenous agar layer. After incubation at room temperature to allow lantibiotic diffusion (1\u20132 h), 2 \u00d7 105 Table 3. List of primers. spores of S. coelicolor strains were spotted at the edges of the gradient plate and streaked to the centre. The plates were incubated 2 days at 30\u00b0C. Since the lantibiotic 97518 is not as potent as NAI-107 and epidermin, resistance assays using gradient plates could not be performed. The 97518 resistance assay was performed by plating out 106 spores on an LB agar plate and placing sterile paper discs soaked with 20 \u03bcg 97518. Plates were photo-graphed after 2 days incubation at 30\u00b0C. NAI-107 and 97518 (NAICONS) were dissolved in 10% dimethylsulphoxide to a final concentration of 1 mg ml-1. Epidermin, isolated from S. epidermidis T\u00fc 3298 (Hoerner et al., 1989), was dissolved in 0.05% acetic acid. MlbQ purification MlbQ without the signal peptide (25\u2013129 aa) was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminally His6-tagged fusion protein. MlbQ was amplified with the primers mlbQhistagfor and mlbQhistagrev (Table 3) and cloned into the vector pET30 Ek/LIC (Novagen) yielding pET30-mlbQ. Escherichia coli Rosetta 2(DE3) was transformed with the plasmid pET30-mlbQ and cultivated in 2 L 13C,15N-labeled M9 minimal medium (BioExpress, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) sup-plemented with 30 \u03bcg ml-1 kanamycin and 25 \u03bcg ml-1 chlo-ramphenicol at 37\u00b0C. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG at an OD600 nm of 0.6. After 16 h cultivation at 18\u00b0C, cultures were harvested and the pellet re-suspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 20 mM MgCl2, pH 8) sup-plemented with 1 mg ml-1 lysozyme, 0.1 mg ml-1 DNase and protease inhibitors (Roche). Cells were disrupted by a French Pressure Cell Press (SIM 3 AMINCO Spectronic Instruments, 3 \u00d7 1000 Psi) and after centrifugation (47 800 g, 30 min, 4\u00b0C), the soluble fraction was used for protein purification by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA Sepharose Column, 5 ml, IBA). The supernatant was loaded on the pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA column, the matrix washed two times with 20 ml wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 8) and eluted six times with 2 ml elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, pH 8). Fractions were checked for the presence of the desired protein on 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Most of the protein was eluted in fractions 3, 4 and 5, which were collected together and dia-lysed against the storage buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.8). After dialysis the protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using an \u00c4KTA purifier system and a MonoQ H55/5 column (GE Healthcare) with a linear salt gradient (Buffer A: 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8 and Buffer B: 20 mM Tris/HCl, 1 M NaCl, pH 8). The protein eluted at \u223c250 mM NaCl, was collected and concentrated with 10 000 MWCO Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The protein concentration was determined using Bradford assay. NMR structure determination All spectra were recorded at 298 K on Bruker AVIII-600 and AVIII-800 spectrometers. Backbone sequential assignments were completed using a strategy based on a 3D-HN(CA)NNH experiment (Weisemann et al., 1993). Aliphatic side-chain assignments were completed with standard TOCSY-based experiments, while aromatic assignments were made by linking aromatic spin systems to the respective CbH2 protons in a 2D-NOESY spectrum. Stereospecific assignments and the resulting C1 rotamer assignments were determined from a combination of HNHB and HA[HBHN](CACO)NH (L\u00f6hr et al., 1999) experiments. Distance data were derived from a set of five 3D-NOESY spectra, including the heteronuclear edited NNH-, CCH-and CNH-NOESY spectra (Diercks et al., 1999) in addition to conventional 15N-and 13C-HSQC-NOESY spectra. A 12C-filtered 2D-NOESY spectrum was recorded for the observation of contacts to aromatic groups. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived using the TALOS+ server (Shen et al., 2009). Generic backbone dihedral restraints designed to restrict residues to allowed regions of the Ramachandran map and well-populated side-chain rotamers were applied for unstructured residues. Hydrogen bond restraints were applied as pseudo-covalent bonds, as outlined in Truffault and colleagues (2001). Refinement was carried out by comparing experimental and back-calculated NOESY spectra using in-house software. Strips were back-calculated for the amide protons of all ordered atoms, plus selected side-chain groups. These were compared with the experimen-tal spectra to confirm backbone and side-chain dihedral angles and to extract additional distance restraints. Structures were calculated with XPLOR (NIH version 2.9.4) using standard protocols with modifications for the inclusion of H-bonds as pseudo-covalent bonds. For the final set, 100 structures were calculated and 18 chosen on the basis of lowest restraint violations. An average structure was calculated and regular-ized to give a structure representative of the ensemble. Details of the input data and the final ensemble are given in Table S1.

        "Abstract The investigation of self-resistance in antibiotic pro-ducers is important to understand the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens and to improve anti-biotic production. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthe-sized antibiotics that mostly target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The actinomycete Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which interferes with peptidoglycan biosynthesis by binding bactoprenol-pyrophosphate-coupled peptidoglycan precursors. In order to understand how Microbispora counteracts the action of its own antibiotic, its peptidoglycan composition was analysed in detail. Microbispora peptidoglycan consists of muropeptides with D-Ala and Gly in similar proportion at the fourth position of the peptide stems and alternative 3-3 cross-links besides the classical 4-3 cross-links. In addition, the NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb) was ana-lysed for the expression of immunity proteins. We show that distinct immunity determinants are encoded in the mlb cluster: the ABC transporter MlbYZ acting cooperatively with the transmembrane protein MlbJ",
        "and the lipoprotein MlbQ. NMR structural analysis of MlbQ revealed a hydrophobic surface patch, which is proposed to bind the cognate lantibiotic. This study demonstrates that immunity in Microbispora is not only based on one determinant but on the action of the distinct immunity proteins MlbQ, MlbYZ and MlbJ.",
        "Introduction The development of antibiotic resistance in clinically rel-evant pathogens is one major obstacle to effective treat-ment of bacterial infections and the main reason for the urgent need of new therapeutic strategies.Among the most exploited classes of antibiotics used against Gram-positive bacteria, beta (\u03b2)-lactams and glycopeptides have played a predominant role in antibiotic chemotherapy. Their wide-spread use has led to the emergence of resistant patho-genic bacteria, and several mechanisms conferring resistance have been well documented (Rice, 2012). Both \u03b2-lactams and glycopeptides are cell wall-targeting antibi-otics which interfere with the peptidoglycan biosynthesis, an essential process in viable cells. Peptidoglycan (PG) is a polymer that surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane pre-serving the cell integrity from the turgor and maintaining the cell shape. It consists of linear glycan chains of repeated N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid disaccharide units (GlcNAc-MurNAc) that are interconnected by peptide cross-links. The key component of PG synthesis is lipid II which consists of the disaccharide GlcNAc-MurNAc loaded onto the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate and linked to a pentapeptide, typically L-Ala-\u03b3-D-Glu-X-D-Ala-D-Ala, where X is meso-A2pm (2,6-diaminopimelic acid) or L-Lys. After the synthesis in the cytoplasm, lipid II is translocated and exposed to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane where it is incorporated in the nascent glycan chains by transglycosylases and pro-cessed by transpeptidases which cross-link the peptide side-chains of adjacent glycan strands (Vollmer et al., 2008). Diversification of the PG assembly pathway leading to \u03b2-lactam and glycopeptide resistance had been widely described.

        "ending in D-Lac or D-Ser instead of D-Ala are two of the major resistance mechanisms found in Gram-positive bac-teria (Rice, 2012). Moreover, L,D-transpeptidases confer resistance both to \u03b2-lactams and glycopeptides by bypass-ing the \u03b2-lactam sensitive D,D-transpeptidase activity of PBPs and using tetrapeptide acyl donors devoid of the target of glycopeptides respectively (Mainardi et al., 2005; 2008). Despite the emergence of resistance to these two classes of antibiotics, PG biosynthesis remains an effec-tive target for the development of new antibacterial strate-gies. The PG precursor lipid II, the bottleneck of cell wall synthesis, is the target not only of glycopeptides but also of lantibiotics, mannopeptimycins and ramoplanin (Breukink and de Kruijff, 2006). Lantibiotics are attractive drug can-didates due to their potency and broad-spectrum activity. A few lantibiotics are currently in preclinical development or in clinical trials for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (Jabes et al., 2011; Crowther et al., 2013; Sandiford, 2015).",
        "Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides which display anti-microbial activity. According to the new nomenclature, lantibiotics are classified into the lanthipeptide family, which comprises lanthionine-containing peptides regard-less of their biological activities (Arnison et al., 2013). Lanthipeptides are characterized by the presence of the thioether-cross-linked amino acids lanthionine (Lan) and 3-methyl-lanthionine (MeLan) that are required for activity and confer protease resistance to the mature product. The cross-linked amino acids are formed by dehydration of serine or threonine residues and intramolecular addition of a cysteinyl thiol to the resulting dehydroamino acids (Knerr and van der Donk, 2012). Lanthipeptides are clas-sified into four classes according to the biosynthetic enzymes that introduce the Lan and MeLan motifs. The most extensively studied lantibiotic, nisin, belongs to the class I lanthipeptides, which are modified by the two dis-tinct enzymes LanB (dehydratase) and LanC (cyclase). Class I lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters encode the precursor peptide and the enzymes involved in lanthionines formation, transporters, proteases, modifying enzymes, regulators and immunity proteins (Willey and van der Donk, 2007). Many of the lantibiotics display their antibacterial activity by binding the PG precursor lipid II, and therefore interfering with the PG biosynthesis (Broetz et al., 1998; Bierbaum and Sahl, 2009). In addition, nisin can permeabilize bacterial membranes by lipid II-dependent pore formation and cause the dissipation of the membrane potential and rapid efflux of small metabo-lites (Wiedemann et al., 2001).",
        "Lantibiotic producers express immunity proteins like ABC transporters, lipoproteins, membrane-associated peptides and transmembrane proteins as a measure of self-protection (Okuda and Sonomoto, 2011). However,",
        "despite the expression of immunity proteins, lantibiotic-producer strains do not exhibit a full resistance, and the susceptibility to their own products may reflect the efficacy of these antibacterials. Indeed, lantibiotic autotoxicity has represented an obstacle for the improvement of fermentation processes (Valsesia et al., 2007). In many antibiotic-producing bacteria, antibiotic resistance is mediated by ABC transporters, which export the drugs through the cytoplasmic membrane (Mendez and Salas, 2001). As lantibiotics interact with lipid II located on the cell surface, ABC transporters involved in lantibiotic immu-nity should have another mechanism. A cell-based trans-port assay reported for EpiEFG showed that this ABC transporter system can extrude the membrane-bound epidermin to the extracellular space, decreasing the con-centration of the lantibiotic in the lipid II immediate envi-ronment (Otto et al., 1998). In contrast to the epidermin cluster (epi), the nisin (nis) and subtilin (spa) gene clusters encode the lipoproteins NisI and SpaI that confer immu-nity to the producers in addition to the ABC transporters NisFEG and SpaFEG, homologues of EpiEFG. The lantibiotics nisin and subtilin have similar structures; however, the corresponding immunity lipoproteins NisI and SpaI do not show any sequence similarity and they do not confer cross-immunity. Although the expression of these genes in surrogate hosts clearly showed an involve-ment in immunity (Stein et al., 2003; 2005), their mecha-nism of action on a molecular level is still largely unknown. NAI-107 is a lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024, active against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylo-coccus aureus, glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and some Gram-negative bacteria (Lazzarini et al., 2006; Castiglione et al., 2008). Because of its interesting antibacterial profile and potent antibacterial activity, NAI-107 is currently in the preclinical development for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens (Jabes et al., 2011; Lepak et al., 2015). NAI-107 inhibits PG biosynthesis and affects the bacterial membrane by slow depolarization (Muench et al., 2014). Macromolecular synthesis, whole-cell and enzyme assays combined with proteomic profiling showed that NAI-107 targets lipid II but it does not display a pore-forming activity (Muench et al., 2014), as previously described for nisin. NAI-107, also called microbisporicin, was the first discovered class I lantibiotic produced by actinomycetes. It includes one methyl-lanthionine, three lanthionines and two unusual lantibiotic modifications: a chlorinated tryptophan and a mono-or dihydroxylated proline (Lee, 2003; Castiglione et al., 2008). The N-terminal lanthionine rings (1-11 amino acids) resemble the lipid II-binding motif of nisin (Hsu et al., 2004), whereas the C-terminal aminovinyl cysteine is also found in epidermin (Allgaier et al., 1985).

Recently, the congeners of the NAI-107 complex produced by Microbispora PTA-5024 and M. corallina NRRL 30420 were characterized (Maffioli et al., 2014). The genes responsible for the biosynthesis of microbisporicin were widely described in the producer M. corallina NRRL 30420 (Foulston and Bibb, 2010). The mib cluster encodes two enzymes not described before in lantibiotic gene clusters: a cytochrome P450 (MibO) and a flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenase (MibH) involved in hydroxylation of proline and chlorination of tryptophan respectively Furthermore, the cluster encodes three puta-tive ABC transporters (MibYZ, MibTU, MibEF), a predicted lipoprotein (MibQ) and a transmembrane protein of unknown function (MibJ). Recently, the draft genome sequence of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 was published (Sosio et al., 2014). The screening of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 genome revealed the presence of a gene cluster with high similarity to the mib cluster, named mlb cluster (Donadio et al., 2009).",
        "Although NAI-107 was tested in several in vitro studies against multi-drug-resistant pathogens, no resistant mutants were observed. The analysis of NAI-107 resist-ance in Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 was therefore con-ducted to determine the mechanisms evolved in the producer strain to protect itself from NAI-107 and predict possible resistance mechanisms in pathogenic bacteria. We used two different approaches to study Microbispora immunity: a detailed analysis of the PG, target of NAI-107 and the investigation of resistance determinants encoded",
        "in the NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb). In particu-lar, we analysed the immunity lipoprotein MlbQ and solved the structure of MlbQ by NMR. This study repre-sents the first comprehensive analysis of immunity in a lantibiotic-producing actinomycete.",
        "Results and discussion The identification of 3-3-cross-linked muropeptides in Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 suggests the action of L,D-transpeptidases in peptidoglycan synthesis The lantibiotic NAI-107 interferes with the late stages of PG biosynthesis by binding the bactoprenol-pyrophosphate coupled PG precursors (Muench et al., 2014). In order to investigate possible PG modifications responsible for the protection of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 from NAI-107, a detailed PG structural analysis was performed combining high performance liquid chromatog-raphy, mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The structure of muropeptide monomers was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2 and MS3). Mass spectrometry analyses of mutanolysin digested PG from exponentially growing bacteria (72 h) revealed the presence of muropeptide monomers and dimers with a structural variability (Fig. 1, Table 1). Besides the presence of pentapeptides (8) (pentapeptide = GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-\u03b3-D-iGln-meso-A2pm-D-Ala-D-Ala), tripeptides (1) and tetrapeptides (7) peptides were detected (Fig. 1, Table 1). The muropeptide monomers from Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 were fully amidated at Glu2 (Table 1).

        "The presence of Gly in the monomer tetrapeptide 3 at m/z 927.4 is presumably the result of a modification that occurs in the late stages of PG maturation, since no UDP-linked PG precursors containing Gly in the fourth position of the peptide were detected in Microbispora. Tetrapeptides ending in D-Ser (2) (Fig. 1,Table 1) were also detected in Microbispora PG, though in minor amounts.The exchange of D-Ala4 for Gly or other D-amino acids is known to occur as a side reaction of L,D-transpeptidases, \u03b2-lactam-resistant enzymes first described in Enterococcus faecium, where they cross-link the PG using tetrapeptides as acyl donor (Mainardi et al., 2005). The presence of several genes in the Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 genome (Sosio et al., 2014) that encode putative L,D-transpeptidases may explain the ability of Microbispora to substitute D-Ala4 for Gly or D-Ser in monomer tetrapeptides.",
        "The modifications described for the muropeptide mono-mers could also be detected for the dimers, which contain Ala (13, 14), Gly (10, 12) or Ser (9, 11) in the fourth or fifth position of the acceptor peptides (Fig. 1, Table 1). Accord-ing to the m/z values, muropeptides with 4-3 cross-links resulting from a D,D-transpeptidase activity were sug-gested (Table 1). Interestingly, the structure of the dimers 9 and 10 could be explained exclusively by the presence of 3-3 cross-links rather than 4-3 cross-links. Dimers with a disaccharide tripeptide as acyl donor were in fact con-sidered to contain direct 3-3 cross-links. Moreover, the presence of two isomers (a and b) for the muropeptides at",

The modifications found in muropeptide mono-mers and dimers suggest the action of both D,D-and L,D-transpeptidases in Microbispora PG cross-linking and remodelling. The activity of L,D-transpeptidases was previously reported for some members of the order Actinomycetales (Lavollay et al., 2008; Hugonnet et al., 2014) but not described before for lantibiotic producers.",
        "The non-producer strains Microbispora RP0 and Microbispora JCM 10266 exhibit the same muropeptides as the NAI-107 producer Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 To determine if the PG composition of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 is linked to NAI-107 production, a non-producer strain was constructed. Since Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 is not genetically accessible, a gene transfer system had to be developed. DNA transfer could be achieved by using a conjugation protocol based on the methylation-proficient donor Escherichia coli S17-1, apramycin for the selection of Microbispora ex-conjugants and phospho-mycin for the inhibition of E. coli (see Experimental procedures). The non-producer strain Microbispora RP0 was obtained by disruption of the NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb) by integration of the plasmid pGusA21-mlbAB. The \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter system allowed an easy identification of recombinant clones car-rying the plasmid (see Experimental procedures). Using bioassays and high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013 mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis, we proved that the mutant Microbispora RP0 does not produce any NAI-107. The PG of Microbispora RP0 was isolated at 72 h and was analysed by HPLC. The HPLC profile of Microbispora RP0 muropeptides at 72 h was similar to that of the wild type (WT) (Fig. S2). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of the same PG modifica-tions (data not shown). Thus, the PG composition of Microbispora RP0 suggested a PG structure that is inde-pendent from NAI-107 production. To determine if the variability of PG muropeptides is characteristic of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024, we analysed the PG of Microbispora JCM 10266, a Microbispora sp. that pro-duces neither the lantibiotic NAI-107 nor any other antibacterial compound. Analysis of Microbispora JCM 10266 PG by mass spectrometry did not show any significant difference to the PG of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 (data not shown). The PG modifications found in Microbispora spp. seemed to be an intrinsic chara-cteristic of Microbispora genus, rather than a mecha-nism of NAI-107 resistance. Peptidoglycan remodelling in",

        "The mlb cluster encodes resistance determinants The occurrence of the same PG structure in the NAI-107 producer and in non-producing Microbispora strains excludes target modification as a specific mechanism of self-protection against NAI-107. To analyse the NAI-107 immunity mechanisms in the producer strain Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024, we first compared its resistance level to that of Microbispora JCM 10266 by bioassays. Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 was considerably more resistant to NAI-107 than the non-producer strain Microbispora JCM 10266 (Fig. 2), which does not contain the mlb cluster (Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 MIC 0.5\u2013 1 \u03bcg ml-1, Microbispora JCM 10266 MIC 0.1 \u03bcg ml-1). Thus, the difference in resistance between the two Microbispora spp. is presumably due to the action of immunity proteins encoded in the NAI-107 gene cluster (mlb). Bioinformatic analysis of the mlb cluster led to the identification of the putative immunity proteins MlbQ, MlbYZ, MlbTU and MlbEF. MlbQ is a lipoprotein of 129 amino acids with a conserved lipobox (LAGC) containing a cysteine, which presumably becomes the N-terminal residue of the mature protein (amino acids 24\u2013129) after lipidation and cleavage of the signal peptide. MlbYZ, MlbTU, MlbEF are putative ABC transporters which are composed of a permease (MlbY, MlbU, MlbE) and an ATPase (MlbZ, MlbT, MlbF) that probably assemble as tetramers of two heterodimers.",
        "To assess the role of these proteins in NAI-107 resistance, mlbQ, mlbYZ, mlbTU and mlbEF were heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M145. The genes were cloned into the integrative plasmid pRM4 under the control of the constitutive promoter ermE*p and resistance assays against NAI-107 were per-formed.

MlbQ conferred NAI-107 resistance also to this strain (data not shown). In contrast to MlbQ, none of the ABC transporters encoded in the mlb cluster conferred NAI-107 protection in S. coelicolor (Fig. 3B). This is in contrast to the experiments described for the MlbEF homologues MibEF and PspEF for which a role in immunity was reported. MibEF and PspEF are ABC transporters encoded in the microbisporicin and planosporicin clusters from the actinomycete species Microbispora corallina and Planomonospora alba respec-tively (Foulston and Bibb, 2010; Sherwood et al., 2013).",

        "MlbJ conferred resistance only in the coexpression with MlbYZ (Fig. 4). The cooperative action of MlbJ and MlbYZ suggested a role of MlbJ as substrate-binding protein. The expression of MlbJ alone conferred a low resistance to NAI-107, probably by intercepting the lantibiotic from the extracellular space. MlbJ contains several predicted membrane-spanning regions (SOSUI ver. 1.11; Hirokawa et al., 1998). According to its hydrophobicity profile and function, we propose that MlbJ is functionally analogous to the LanH family of proteins. LanH proteins are acces-sory proteins that act with the immunity ABC transporters LanFEG (Okuda and Sonomoto, 2011). One of the best-characterized LanH proteins is NukH, a transmembrane protein from Staphylococcus warneri. NukH recognizes",
        "the lantibiotic nukacin ISK-1 and transfers it to the ABC transporter NukFEG, which then pumps the lantibiotic to the extracellular space in an energy-dependent manner (Okuda et al., 2008). The coexpression of MlbJ with MlbTU and MlbEF did not confer NAI-107 resistance. In the microbisporin cluster, the genes encoding the ABC transporter MibTU are co-transcribed together with the genes mibBCDTUV (Foulston and Bibb, 2010). Since the gene organization in the mlb gene cluster is identical, the same transcriptional unit can be supposed. Therefore, a role of MlbTU as exporter was speculated. The deletion of the mlbEF homologous gene mibEF from the micro-bisporicin gene cluster resulted in markedly delayed and greatly reduced levels of microbisporicin production. Therefore, the authors speculated that MibEF is either involved in immunity or in lantibiotic export (Foulston and Bibb, 2010).",
        "The lipoprotein MlbQ confers resistance specifically to NAI-107-like lantibiotics Since it is known that lipoproteins often act as substrate binding proteins of ABC transporters in Gram-positive bacteria, MlbQ was tested in coexpression experiments with the ABC transporters encoded in the mlb cluster, as reported for the coexpression of mlbJ. The resistance assays against NAI-107 did not show any difference between S. coelicolor M145 expressing an ABC trans-porter alone or in combination with MlbQ (data not shown). The coexpression with the ABC transporters did not increase the immunity effect of MlbQ. Therefore, we assumed an MlbQ mode of action independent of the ABC transporters MlbYZ, MlbTU and MlbEF. To explore the specificity of MlbQ-mediated resistance, S. coelicolor pRM4-mlbQ was tested against the lantibiotic 97518. 97518, also called planosporicin, is an NAI-107-like lantibiotic that has an identical arrangement of thioether rings to NAI-107 and a similar antibacterial spec-trum, but is considerably less potent than NAI-107 (Maffioli et al., 2009). Recently, the elucidation of the 3D structure of NAI-107 and 97518 in solution by NMR underlined the conformational differences between the two related lantibiotics, which might be responsible for the significant difference in potency (Vasile et al., 2011). MlbQ cross-resistance to 97518 was determined by filter disc assay. S. coelicolor pRM4-mlbQ was grown on a Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) agar plate where a sterile filter disc soaked with 20 \u03bcg of 97518 was applied. Streptomyces coelicolor pRM4-mlbQ was more resistant against 97518 than the WT (Fig. 5A). The 97518 biosynthetic gene cluster encodes a lipopro-tein, named PlnQ (GenBank KM588197), which displays 62% amino acid identity to MlbQ. To further investigate the cross-resistance to the lantibiotics NAI-107 and 97518, PlnQ was expressed in S. coelicolor M145, and resistance",

        "assays were performed (see Experimental procedures). PlnQ conferred resistance to both NAI-107 and 97518 (Fig. 5A and B), as observed for the lipoprotein MlbQ. However, S. coelicolor pRM4-plnQ was less resistant against NAI-107 than S. coelicolor pRM4-mlbQ. Lantibiotic cross-resistance was previously reported for the membrane-associated proteins PepI and EciI encoded in the Pep5 and epicidin 280 lantibiotic clusters from Staphylococcus epidermidis 5 and S. epidermidis BN280 respectively (Heidrich et al., 1998). In contrast, cross-resistance was not observed for NisI, the lipoprotein encoded in the nisin gene cluster (nis). NisI did not confer resistance to subtilin, a lantibiotic with an identical organi-",
        "zation of the thioether rings (Stein et al., 2003). To confirm the specificity of MlbQ action against NAI-107-like lantibiotics, we tested S. coelicolor M145 pRM4-mlbQ against epidermin (Allgaier et al., 1985). Epidermin is a class I lantibiotic which presents an N-terminal nisin-like lipid II binding motif and a C-terminal aminovinyl cysteine. Epidermin differs from NAI-107 and 97518 in the central region where the flexible 12-15 amino acids are substi-tuted in NAI-107 by the ring C. S. coelicolor M145 express-ing MlbQ was not more resistant to epidermin than the WT (Fig. 5C). The resistance assays against 97518 and epidermin showed the specificity of MlbQ to NAI-107-like lantibiotics.",
        "MlbQ possesses a hydrophobic surface patch proposed to bind NAI-107 As MlbQ recognizes structurally related lantibiotics and no effect was observed against other antibiotics with the same target, we hypothesized a mode of action based on the direct interaction with the lantibiotic. To assess this, we purified an N-terminally His6-tagged fusion protein from E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) and determined the structure of MlbQ in solution by NMR spectroscopy (PDB 2MVO) (Fig. 6). MlbQ is divided into an unstructured N-terminal region followed by a globular domain (P55-G147). The domain is wedge shaped, consisting of a C-terminal helix (\u03b13) packed at an angle against a four-stranded \u03b2-sheet, with a disulphide bond connecting the helix to the sheet at its C-terminal end. This sheet has a simple meander topology, but features an unusual structured \u03b21-\u03b22 loop at the broad end of the wedge, including a short helix (\u03b13) that runs perpendicular to the sheet. A conserved trypto-phan residue (W77) anchors the loop into the hydrophobic core of the fold, while a short \u03b2-strand forms a bridge with the long loop between \u03b24 and \u03b13. This loop is largely unstructured, but begins with a short helix (\u03b12) that also runs perpendicular to the sheet, but in the opposite direc-tion to that in the \u03b21-\u03b22 loop. Three-dimensional (3D) structural comparisons using the DALI server (Holm and Rosenstr\u00f6m, 2010) found only limited similarity to known folds. The only significant simi-larity is to the IQ domain of Ras GTPase activating-like proteins (IQGAP2: Z-score 2.5, RMSD 2.5 \u00c5). This simi-larity is considerable over the \u03b2-meander, \u03b21-\u03b22 loop and C-terminal helix and includes an analogous \u03b2-bridge. The major differences are that in IQGAP2, the \u03b12 helix is longer and runs in the opposite direction, almost parallel to \u03b13, and the \u03b2-bridge forms part of a larger sheet, giving the fold a sandwich-like character. No sequence similarity between representatives of the IQGAP2 fold and MlbQ could be detected using sensitive profile-based methods. The only other lantibiotic immunity protein of known structure is SpaI from Bacillus subtilis (Christ et al., 2012).",

        "This protein shows no structural similarity to MlbQ. However, it is proposed to bind its cognate lantibiotic, subtilin, via an extended hydrophobic patch on its surface. Looking for a similar feature on MlbQ, we located an analogous surface patch bounded by the \u03b21-\u03b22 loop, \u03b13, anda structured, conserved hydrophobic section of the N-terminal loop (P55-N64), which runs antiparallel to \u03b21 (Fig. 6). The extended shape of the patch and its length (\u223c16 \u00c5) are comparable to that in SpaI. Unfortu-nately, the low solubility of the lantibiotic in the NMR buffers precluded mapping of the potential interaction sites for SpaI (Christ et al., 2012), and similar problems were encountered for MlbQ. The extremely poor solubility of the lantibiotic in aqueous buffers also made alternative binding assays with CD or fluorescence spectroscopy impossible (data not shown).",

Single and double cross-over events were iden-tified using the GUS reporter system (see Experimental procedures). Microbispora \u0394mlbQ was impaired in growth",
        "compared with the WT strain from start of NAI-107 pro-duction at 48 h (Fig. 7).

The complemented mutant \u0394mlbQ(pRM4-mlbQ) revealed the same phenotype as the WT, demonstrating that the impaired growth of the mlbQ mutant is a conse-quence of mlbQ deletion. These observations confirmed that MlbQ is required for normal growth in the presence of NAI-107.",
        "Conclusions Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which interferes with PG biosynthesis by target-ing the bactoprenol-pyrophosphate coupled PG precur-sors. The PG of Microbispora exhibits muropeptides consisting of tripeptides, tetrapeptides, pentapeptides and different amino acids in the fourth and fifth position of the tetrapeptides and pentapeptides respectively. The presence of these muropeptides suggests the action of L,D-transpeptidases and D,D-carboxypeptidases in PG biosynthesis and remodelling. Both enzymes were described to play a crucial role in glycopeptide and \u03b2-lactam-resistance. Although PG modifications seem not to be responsible for NAI-107 resistance, we can speculate",

Ex-conjugants were selected with 50 \u03bcg ml-1 apramycin, 50 \u03bcg ml-1 hygromycin and confirmed by colony PCR.",
        "Manipulation of Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 and Microbispora JCM 10266 A protocol for conjugation between the DNA methylation pro-ficient E. coli S17-1 and Microbispora spp. was established. An aliquot (1 ml) of Microbispora glycerol stock was inoculated in 10 ml of nutrient broth medium (Difco).After 20 h, the culture was sonicated for 20 min in a water bath sonicator, the myce-lium recovered by centrifugation at 4270 g for 10 min, washed once with the medium and concentrated 1:10. E. coli S17-1 was grown overnight, washed twice with LB and re-suspended in 1/10 of the initial volume. 100 \u00b5l of Microbispora mycelium were mixed with 100 \u03bcl of E. coli, and the mixture was plated on MS medium containing 10 mM MgCl2 (Kieser et al., 2000). After 24 h of incubation at 30\u00b0C, each plate was overlaid with 1 ml water containing 1500 \u03bcg apramycin and 1250 \u03bcg phosphomycin. After about 10 days of incubation at 30\u00b0C, ex-conjugants were streaked onto HA plates containing 25 \u03bcg ml-1 apramycin and 50 \u03bcg ml-1 phosphomycin and checked by colony PCR.",
        "Construction of Microbispora recombinant strains To obtain the non-producer Microbispora RP0 strain, the mlb cluster was disrupted by single cross-over integration of the pGusA21-mlbAB plasmid containing the region from 34 672 bp to 36 222 bp (GenBank: AWEV00000000.1), which",
        "comprises part of the genes mlbA and mlbB encoding the precursor peptide and the dehydratase respectively (primers mlbAfor and mlbBrev, Table 3). The deletion mutant of mlbQ was generated by double cross-over of the plasmid pA18gus\u0394mlbQ containing a 1509 bp upstream fragment (EcoRI/BamHI) and a 1513 bp downstream fragment (BamHI/ HindIII) of mlbQ. The deletion vector pA18gus\u0394mlbQ was introduced into E. coli S17-1 by transformation and then con-jugated into Microbispora. The integration of pA18gus\u0394mlbQ by a single cross-over (apramycin resistant) was identified by GUS agar plate-based assay (Myronovskyi et al., 2011). Briefly, Microbispora recombinant clones were streaked onto MV0.1 agar plates and after 7 days incubation at 30\u00b0C overlaid with 1 mg ml-1 X-Gluc (Sigma). A \u0394mlbQ mutant was selected by screening colonies for the second cross-over (apramycin sensitive), and the correct gene deletion was confirmed by PCR.",
        "Lantibiotic resistance bioassay The resistance of S. coelicolor recombinant strains to the lantibiotics NAI-107 and epidermin was tested using the gra-dient plate technique (Szybalski and Bryson, 1952). Gradient plates (0\u20132 or 0\u20134 \u03bcg ml-1) were prepared as described below. Two layers of agar were poured successively into a squared plate (10 \u00d7 10 mm) to obtain a gradient from one side to the other. The desired volume of lantibiotic (final concentration of 2 or 4 \u03bcg ml-1) was added to 30 ml LB agar, which was poured into the plate. The plate was propped up using a 3 mm thick bar, just enough for the agar to cover the entire bottom. In this way, the agar formed a wedge that was shallow on one side and deep on the other side of the plate. After agar solidification, the plate was placed in a horizontal position, and 30 ml LB agar without lantibiotic was poured to have a homogenous agar layer. After incubation at room temperature to allow lantibiotic diffusion (1\u20132 h), 2 \u00d7 105",
        "Table 3. List of primers.",
        "spores of S. coelicolor strains were spotted at the edges of the gradient plate and streaked to the centre. The plates were incubated 2 days at 30\u00b0C.",
        "Since the lantibiotic 97518 is not as potent as NAI-107 and epidermin, resistance assays using gradient plates could not be performed. The 97518 resistance assay was performed by plating out 106 spores on an LB agar plate and placing sterile paper discs soaked with 20 \u03bcg 97518. Plates were photo-graphed after 2 days incubation at 30\u00b0C. NAI-107 and 97518 (NAICONS) were dissolved in 10% dimethylsulphoxide to a final concentration of 1 mg ml-1. Epidermin, isolated from S. epidermidis T\u00fc 3298 (Hoerner et al., 1989), was dissolved in 0.05% acetic acid.",
        "MlbQ purification MlbQ without the signal peptide (25\u2013129 aa) was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminally His6-tagged fusion protein. MlbQ was amplified with the primers mlbQhistagfor and mlbQhistagrev (Table 3) and cloned into the vector pET30 Ek/LIC (Novagen) yielding pET30-mlbQ. Escherichia coli Rosetta 2(DE3) was transformed with the plasmid pET30-mlbQ and cultivated in 2 L 13C,15N-labeled M9 minimal medium (BioExpress, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) sup-plemented with 30 \u03bcg ml-1 kanamycin and 25 \u03bcg ml-1 chlo-ramphenicol at 37\u00b0C. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG at an OD600 nm of 0.6. After 16 h cultivation at 18\u00b0C, cultures were harvested and the pellet re-suspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 20 mM MgCl2, pH 8) sup-plemented with 1 mg ml-1 lysozyme, 0.1 mg ml-1 DNase and protease inhibitors (Roche). Cells were disrupted by a French Pressure Cell Press (SIM 3 AMINCO Spectronic Instruments, 3 \u00d7 1000 Psi) and after centrifugation (47 800 g, 30 min, 4\u00b0C), the soluble fraction was used for protein purification by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA Sepharose Column, 5 ml, IBA). The supernatant was loaded on the pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA column, the matrix washed two times with 20 ml wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 8) and eluted six times with 2 ml elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, pH 8). Fractions were checked for the presence of the desired protein on 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Most of the protein was eluted in fractions 3, 4 and 5, which were collected together and dia-lysed against the storage buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.8). After dialysis the protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using an \u00c4KTA purifier system and a MonoQ H55/5 column (GE Healthcare) with a linear salt gradient (Buffer A: 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8 and Buffer B: 20 mM Tris/HCl, 1 M NaCl, pH 8). The protein eluted at \u223c250 mM NaCl, was collected and concentrated with 10 000 MWCO Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The protein concentration was determined using Bradford assay.",
        "NMR structure determination All spectra were recorded at 298 K on Bruker AVIII-600 and AVIII-800 spectrometers. Backbone sequential assignments were completed using a strategy based on a 3D-HN(CA)NNH experiment (Weisemann et al., 1993). Aliphatic side-chain",
        "assignments were completed with standard TOCSY-based experiments, while aromatic assignments were made by linking aromatic spin systems to the respective CbH2 protons in a 2D-NOESY spectrum. Stereospecific assignments and the resulting C1 rotamer assignments were determined from a combination of HNHB and HA[HBHN](CACO)NH (L\u00f6hr et al., 1999) experiments. Distance data were derived from a set of five 3D-NOESY spectra, including the heteronuclear edited NNH-, CCH-and CNH-NOESY spectra (Diercks et al., 1999) in addition to conventional 15N-and 13C-HSQC-NOESY spectra. A 12C-filtered 2D-NOESY spectrum was recorded for the observation of contacts to aromatic groups. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived using the TALOS+ server (Shen et al., 2009). Generic backbone dihedral restraints designed to restrict residues to allowed regions of the Ramachandran map and well-populated side-chain rotamers were applied for unstructured residues. Hydrogen bond restraints were applied as pseudo-covalent bonds, as outlined in Truffault and colleagues (2001). Refinement was carried out by comparing experimental and back-calculated NOESY spectra using in-house software. Strips were back-calculated for the amide protons of all ordered atoms, plus selected side-chain groups. These were compared with the experimen-tal spectra to confirm backbone and side-chain dihedral angles and to extract additional distance restraints. Structures were calculated with XPLOR (NIH version 2.9.4) using standard protocols with modifications for the inclusion of H-bonds as pseudo-covalent bonds. For the final set, 100 structures were calculated and 18 chosen on the basis of lowest restraint violations. An average structure was calculated and regular-ized to give a structure representative of the ensemble. Details of the input data and the final ensemble are given in Table S1.",
