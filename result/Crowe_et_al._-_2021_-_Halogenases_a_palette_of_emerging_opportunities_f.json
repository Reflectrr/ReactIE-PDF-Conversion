Goss * The enzymatic generation of carbon\u2013halogen bonds is a powerful strategy used by both nature and synthetic chemists to tune the bioactivity, bioavailability and reactivity of compounds, opening up the opportunity for selective C\u2013H functionalisation. Genes encoding halogenase enzymes have recently been shown to transcend all kingdoms of life. These enzymes install halogen atoms into aromatic and less activated aliphatic substrates, achieving selectivities that are often challenging to accomplish using synthetic methodologies. Significant advances in both halogenase discovery and engineering have provided a toolbox of enzymes, enabling the ready use of these catalysts in biotransformations, synthetic biology, and in combination with chemical catalysis to enable late stage C\u2013H functionalisation. With a focus on substrate scope, this review outlines the mechanisms employed by the major classes of halogenases, while in parallel, it highlights key advances in the utilisation of the combination of enzymatic halogenation and chemical catalysis for C\u2013H activation and diversification. Introduction Halogenated organic compounds play an important role in society. In the agrochemical sector, a staggering 96% of herbi-cides, fungicides, insecticides, acaricides and nematicides pro-duced since 2010 contain halogen atoms.1 Such compounds are valuable commodities; for example, the top-selling insecticide imidacloprid (Fig. 1A) 1 had sales of 1.09 billion USD in 2011 alone,2 and in 2013, 50% of marketed top drugs contain School of Chemistry, and BSRC, University of St Andrews, North Haugh, St Andrews KY16 9ST, UK.

Due to bond polarisation and the ability to form highly directional halogen bonds to electron-rich oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and aromatic rings, halogen incorporation may be used to enhance stability, and increase lipophilicity which in turn can influence bioavailability and modulate compound bioactivity.8 Beyond these applications, series of fluorinated and iodinated compounds are used in radiotherapy and biomedical imaging.9,10 Halogenation is also central to molecule construction and manufacture.

Synthetically, the generation of organohalides is currently achieved through the addition of molecular halogens, hydrohalogenation, or the use of reagents enabling nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic aromatic substitution [EAS]. These reactions are generally accompanied by environmental and selectivity challenges due to the toxic, corrosive and reactive nature of the reagents used, and the propensity to generate complex product mixtures.11 Whilst recent advances in homogenous catalyst design has meant more selective catalytic approaches towards halogenation are known, such catalysts can be complex, costly and time consuming to synthesise.12 Though naturally occurring organohalides were initially speculated to be nothing more than a biological curiosity, artefact, or to be anthropogenic in origin, today, over 5000 halogenated natural products are known, with genes encoding halogenases identified across all kingdoms of life.13 These represent a resource for greener and often highly regioselective halogenation. An increased appreciation of mechanisms underpinning enzymatic halogenation has evolved over the past 25 years, and may broadly be classified as electrophilic, nucleophilic or radical halogenation. Whilst a good level of understanding of the enzymatic active sites and structural requirements of these enzymes exists, a number of fundamental details remain to be elucidated.

Mechanisms for biocatalytic halogenation Enzymatic halogenation is classified mechanistically in accordance with whether the halogen is introduced by an electrophilic, nucleo-philic, or radical halide species, with the vast majority of the enzymes that have been discovered so far, being electrophilic halogenases, mediating oxidation of the halogen to generate a reactive electrophilic species. There is further subdivision within the broader halogenase categories, based on the exact catalytic species and cofactor which enables halogen oxidation. 1.1 Electrophilic (X+) halogenation 1.1.1 Haloperoxidases. Haloperoxidases are defined as enzymes that utilise hydrogen peroxide and chloride, bromide or iodide to generate HOX. These enzymes are named in accordance with the most electronegative halogen for which they can affect oxidation. Haloperoxidases are generally the least regioselective of the enzymes enabling halogenation; catalysing the generation of free hypohalous acid, which in all but a few cases, is released by the enzyme. The earliest reported studies of halogenation enabled by an enzyme date back to 1959, when Lowell Hager discovered a haloperoxidase (HPO) from the fungus Calariomyces fumago.14 The enzyme that Hager had utilised as part of a lysate was named chloroperoxidase or (CPO) and was shown to be capable of affecting dichlorination of 1,3-cyclopentanedione 12. It has thus been postulated to be involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic caldariomycin 14 (Scheme 1C).15 CPO may be described more specifically as a heme iron-dependent haloperoxidase, a subset of haloperox-idases that contain a heme-iron cofactor coordinated to an axial cysteine ligand within the enzyme. Hydrogen peroxide binds axially to heme-Fe(III) in its resting state to form a None+heme-Fe(IV)QO intermediate, denoted compound I.23 Addition of halide to the ferryl oxygen produces a heme-Fe(III)\u2013OX species (Scheme 1A, IV). Free hypohalous acid, HOX, is generated which reacts with an electron-rich substrate (Scheme 1A).24 Generation of electrophilic X+ allows halogenation of electron-rich compounds by electrophilic aromatic substitution, generally at the most reactive site(s) within the substrate. CPO has been used biocatalytically to mediate the chlorination, bromination or iodination of a variety of electron-rich substrates (see Section 2), however, as it lacks a site to position the substrate, no regiocontrol beyond that conferred by the electronics of the substrate is observed. The vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (V-HPOs) operate by an analogous mechanism, again generating and, mostly releasing, free hypohalous acid. This subcategory of haloperox-idase is widely found in algae, fungi and bacteria, and utilises a vanadium cofactor bound by an axial histidine ligand.25 In the resting state, the cofactor is in a trigonal bipyramidal configu-ration (Scheme 1B, V), a distal H2O2 displaces two hydroxyl ligands giving rise to formation of the known Z2-peroxido complex (Scheme 1B, VII), with the distorted square pyramidal geometry. Though the exact order of events and level of protona-tion here is not known, a postulated catalytic cycle is shown. A lysine residue hydrogen bonded to an equatorial V\u2013O oxygen activates the peroxide complex for XNone attack and a return to the Scheme 1 Haloperoxidase HOX generation and utilisation.

Rev., 2021, 50, 9443\u20139481 | 9447trigonal bipyramidal geometry (Scheme 1B, VIII) is observed. The resulting V\u2013OX species undergoes hydrolysis to generate electrophilic X+ in the form of free HOX.26 Electrophilic aromatic substitution occurs, as in the case with heme-iron haloperoxidases.27 A notable difference with the heme iron-dependent biocatalytic cycle is that the vanadium centre main-tains its oxidation state throughout the process.28 Haloperoxidases had initially been considered to lack significant enzyme-mediated selectivity due to the release of freely diffusible hypohalous acid. The free electrophilic species allows halogenation at the most electron-rich carbon, and a mixture of mono-, di-and tri-substituted products can often be observed. Detection of the free HOX through reaction with nucleophilic monochlorodimedone (MCD) 15 has previously been used to assay for haloperoxidase activity (Scheme 1D).29 However, for a number of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases, substrate, regio-and even stereo-specific halogenation is evident, as noted in the biosynthesis of napyradiomycins 76,30 and merochlorins 77, 78.31 (Scheme 5). Currently, the exact mechanistic rationale for this specificity is not known. Here, free HOCl is notably not detected in assay with MCD.31 It is thus postulated that residues within the enzyme might transiently support the electrophilic HOCl, whilst the electron-rich substrate is appropriately and proximally positioned. Moore invokes the involvement of an active site lysine forming a haloamine, in a manner analogous to the FDHs.31,32 Though NapH1 from napyr-adiomycin biosynthesis is associated with the first chlorination event, this enzyme is also capable of mediating nonspecific bromination through generation and release of HOBr. Greater understanding of the mechanism enabling selective halogenation by these series of enzymes would be valuable, potentially enabling informed discovery of further enzymes with biotechnological potential. 1.1.2 Flavin-dependent halogenases. The haloperoxidases remained the only known halogenases for several decades until in 1995, the first of a second series of halogenases, the flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs), Chl from 7-chlortetracycline 73 biosynthesis in Streptomyces aureofaciens was revealed in a study by Dairi.33 The enzyme was implicated as being involved in chlorination with knockouts of the gene encoding Chl lacking halogenated product. However, from these initial stu-dies, it was not fully apparent that this new series of enzymes were flavin-dependent, only a partial protein sequence lacking 100 amino acids at the N-terminal end including the flavin binding site. In vitro analysis of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA, by van Pe\u0301e and co-workers, demonstrated the powerful regioselectivity of this new class of halogenase and the requirement for both flavin and molecular di-oxygen.34,35 The FDHs can be separated into those acting on free substrates (variant A), and those requiring their substrate to be covalently tethered to a carrier protein via a phosphopan-tatheine linker (variant B).36 The most extensively investigated and engineered FDHs are the tryptophan halogenases, variant A FDHs enabling regioselective halogenation of tryptophan at the 5, 6 or 7 positions. The first structural insights as to how FDHs mediate their exquisite regioselectivity were revealed by van Pe\u0301e and Naismith.37 However, 15 years on and debate still remains as to the exact way in which these enzymes function. Details as to which residues within the active site participate may vary from one enzyme to another. The mechanisms proposed by Walsh38 and van Pe\u0301e39 for the flavin dependent tryptophan halogenase are presented in Scheme 2B and C. Reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2), (Scheme 2A, I) and dioxygen in the presence of chloride, bromide or iodide are utilised by these enzymes to catalyse C\u2013H to C\u2013X. Freely diffusible FAD binds to a conserved GxGxxG motif. The reduced cofactor, FADH2, (Scheme 2A, II) reacts with molecular oxygen to form FAD(C4a)\u2013OOH (III), which subsequently reacts with a nucleophilic halide releasing HOX and FAD(C4a)\u2013OH (Scheme 2A, IV).40 Unlike haloperoxidases, the HOX generation and electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) events are spatially separated by a B10 \u00c5 tunnel. At the end of this tunnel is a conserved lysine, proposed by Walsh to react with the HOX thereby forming a haloamine intermediate, guiding the regio-chemistry of halogenation. (Scheme 2B).38 Mutation of this lysine residue to alanine, across a series of halogenases including RebH, PrnA, and Rdc2, results in loss of activity.41 In a subtly different mechanism, van Pe\u0301e invokes a proximal glutamate residue, as well as the lysine residue binding to HOX, thereby activating it and positioning it (Scheme 2C).39 In both models, the electrophilic halogenating species is directed towards the substrate, promoting a regioselective EAS reaction. The exact mechanism and halogenating species remain elusive. Mutation of this active site glutamate to glutamine in PrnA results in a drop in rate by two orders of magnitude.37 This glutamate is not present in the more electron-rich phenol halogenases. A different proposed role for this active site glutamate, invoked in deprotonation of the Wheland intermediate indole benzo ring in the tryptophan halogenases, is that it perhaps plays a role in reducing the activation energy of halogenation of these less electron-rich species.41 Notably no kinetic isotope effect is observed for halogenation of tryptophan by RebH.42 These FDHs share a similar flavin binding domain to the flavin-dependent monoxygenases, and though most utilise free and diffusible FAD, which is converted to FADH2, variants exist where the flavin is covalently bound to the enzyme, such as in the case of CmlS involved in chloramphenicol biosynthesis.44 Naturally, most FDHs are usually provided the reduced flavin by a partner flavin reductase that utilises NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD to generate reduced FADH2. 35 The partner flavin reductase can be readily substituted for any other capable of producing FADH2. Single component FDHs, that have this reductase function present within the one protein, also exist; the first discovered example of such an enzyme was Bmp5.45 This enzyme shows other notable differences to all previously studied FDHs; in analogy to the decarboxylative hydroxylation observed for a single component monooxygenase, decarboxylative dibromination of 18 occurs (Fig. 2F).45 Other intriguing variations of the FDHs also exist, recently, the first of a new class of zinc-binding FDHs, MalA from the biosynthesis of the malbrancheamides 21 and 22 (Fig. 2G) was reported.

In the first step, positions 5 and 6 appear to be halogenated with comparable rates, perhaps due to increased electron density, the second halogenation even occurs far more quickly. Within the enzyme, the active site glutamate is seen proximal to the NH of the indole. It is clearly implicated in deprotonating this moiety, rendering the substrate more nucleophilic, and whilst mutation of this glutamate to aspartate results in low but observable activity, mutation to glutamine renders the enzyme inactive.46 FDHs contain multiple sequence motifs; a series of amino acid residues integral for enzyme activity or structure, that are generally conserved throughout all FDHs. These are a dinucleotide-binding motif GxGxxG, part of the Rossman fold allowing for binding of flavin and NAD(P)H,49 and a tryptophan motif WxWxIP, suggested to block binding of substrate near the bound cofactor, thus preventing a monooxygenation reaction instead of halogenation.37 It is notable though, that GxGxxG, the flavin binding motif is present in almost all flavoenzymes. The WxWxIP motif or variants of this motif, is known to be absent in a number of FDHs including the more unusual Bmp5.48 A new motif, Fx.Px.Sx.G was recently reported. This, or variants of this motif in which G is replaced with a charge bearing residue, line the tunnel between the flavin binding site and the site of halogenation, may be found in all active FDHs.47 As such, it can be used as a method for quickly identifying candidate FDHs from uncurated sequence data. A complementary and overlapping motif FX[DE]PX[EFL] was subsequently identified by Lewis and coworkers.157 Notably, almost all halogenases studied, until recently, have been identified from bacteria and fungi, most being found due to their implication in the biosynthesis of a specific natural product or series of natural products. Iodination had also been missing from the FDH portfolio of reactions, though postulated to be involved in the biosynthesis of iodinated natural products.50 Whilst efforts had been made to explore the utilisation of enzymes such as RebH for iodination, incubation of such Scheme 2 FDH-mediated electrophilic halogenation.

Hydrophobic residues anchor the substrate in position, enabling regiospecific halogenation as guided by the proximal lysine (K79). Glutamate enables further activation, of otherwise less electrophilic substrates. It is postulated that by virtue of openness of this active site not only can a large range of small to sterically bulky substrates be processed, but halogenation by the largest and most readily oxidised of the halides is enabled.47 1.2 Radical (XNone) halogenation. The halogenation of less electron-rich alkyl groups requires a different enzymatic strat-egy compared to the halogenation of activated aryl moieties.52 To achieve these energetically less favourable halogenations, radical chemistry is employed.

Understanding of the catalytic cycle mediated by the NHFeHals is informed by the studies of the hydroxylases, which also require a non-heme iron centre, a-KG and O2 to function (Scheme 3). The catalytic cycle may notionally be considered to start with octahedral FeII coordinated in a bidentate fashion by a-KG, and a weakly bound water ligand that is subsequently replaced by molecular oxygen. The remaining three positions, a \u2018\u2018facial triad,\u2019\u2019 in hydroxylases, consists of two histidine residues and the carboxylate of either an aspartate or glutamate residue at the active site.53 In halogenases, this carboxylate residue is usually found to be replaced by either an alanine or glycine, thereby enabling the halogen ion to coordinate at this vacant coordination site (Scheme 3, I). It has been shown that the weakly bound axial water ligand is initially displaced by substrate binding, triggering the subsequent reaction of II with molecular oxygen.54 Oxidative decarboxylation of III affords trigonal bipyramidal IV, with succinate coordinated, and is the driving force for the catalysis. This high valent, high energy FeIV-oxido species is capable of abstracting HNone from an otherwise unactivated alkyl group.55 The regio-selectivity of abstraction is governed by how the substrate is positioned within the enzyme\u2019s active site. Selectivity for reaction of generated substrate radical with Fe(III)\u2013X bond, leading to the desired halogenation over the Fe(III)\u2013OH bond, which would lead to hydroxylation, is thought to be controlled by careful substrate positioning over FeIII species V.56 In HctB, a NHFeHal from hectochlorin biosynthesis, residues such as the Glu223 and Arg254 are thought to influence the charge density of the chlorine ligand, and are thus postulated to further promote halogenation.57 The resultant alkyl radical proceeds to extract XNone from V, returning the metal centre to its FeII state. Significant conformational changes are observed within these NHFe proteins. These changes are postulated to occur directly after oxygen binding and the subsequent decarboxylation event, orientating the substrate for the observed regioselective halo-genation. Crystal structures of WelO5 with NO (an O2 analogue) reveal a significant change in conformation. Initially, NHFeHals appeared to be difficult to handle in vitro due to oxygen sensitivity of the Fe(II) core,58 however, recent advances suggest an iron-reconstitution step can be performed to activate enzymes purified aerobically.59 The majority of NHFeHals, such as SyrB1,58 BarB1 and BarB2,60 and CurA halogenase,61 like the variant B FDHs, all required the substrate to be presented on carrier proteins, tethered via a phosphopantatheine linker (Ppant). In 2014, WelO5 was discovered, becoming the first member of a new family of NHFeHals (that we will refer to as variant A NHFeHals), which act on freestanding substrates.62 Excitingly, these open up the possibility for using such proteins more readily in biotransformations. 1.3 Nucleophilic (XNone) halogenation. Though the C\u2013F bonds are prevalent in pharmaceuticals, and fluorine is the most abundant of the halogens on earth, few fluoro-metabolites are known. So far, 13 fluorometabolites, 7 of these being closely related fluorinated lipids, have been discovered. The bacterium Streptomyces cattleya is known to biosynthesise three of this limited portfolio of fluorinated metabolites: fluoroacetate, 4-fluorothreonine, and (2R,3S,4S)-trihydroxy-5-fluoropentanoic acid. These compounds are generated by the \u2018\u2018fluorinase,\u2019\u2019 more formally named adenosyl fluoride synthase or FlA, that was discovered by O\u2019Hagan and co-workers.63 FlA is closely related to the more recently discovered SalL, an enzyme that mediates chlorination in salinosporamide biosynthesis.64 These enzymes are members of a rare group of nucleophilic halogenases, all of which utilise S-adenosyl-L-methionine 23 (SAM) as substrate. Streptomyces calvus is capable of biosynthe-sising a fourth bacterial fluorometabolite, nucleocidin.65 Intriguingly, a gene with similarity to that which encodes the fluorinase is absent from the genome of this organism implying that a further group of halogenases capable of mediating C\u2013F bond formation exists. The dearth of fluoro-metabolites found in nature may perhaps be attributed to a number of factors. With the high electronegativity of fluorine, the possibility of oxidation to generate a fluorous electrophile or even a fluorous radical is energetically challenging, and no enzymes have so far shown this capability. Also, fluoride, though abundant, is generally present in minerals such as fluorospar (fluorite), which have high lattice energies and poor solubilities. Once in solution, fluoride is surrounded by a sheath of water, its high enthalpy of hydration (490 kJ molNone1) precludes ready displacement of the water molecules to access the naked fluoride ion required for nucleophilic attack.66 The nucleophilic halogenases characterised so far all operate by holding the halide proximal to the electrophile, SAM. Crystal-lographic studies of the fluorinase reveal a small pocket, the fluoride binding site, giving insight into how displacement of the hydration sphere might be achieved. Whilst predominantly hydrophobic, this small pocket contains a serine.67 Dehydration is proposed to occur when SAM binds with the positive charge on the sulphur possibly assisting with stabilisation of the naked fluoride. The requirement for the fluoride ion to bind first in order for a productive complex to be formed, is argued based on observed substrate inhibition by SAM. Within the crystal structure, SAM may be seen bound with its ribose ring forced Scheme 3 Radical halogenation.

Rev., 2021, 50, 9443\u20139481 | 9451into a high energy, eclipsed conformation. The halide anion is positioned collinearly with the SAM C\u2013S bond, thus promoting an SN2 backside attack (Scheme 4). 67 When the enzyme is crystallised in the presence of both SAM and fluoride, the products L-methionine and 50-fluoro-50-deoxyadenosine (50-FDA) with the ribose ring in the relaxed conformation may be observed. The fluorinase has a strong preference for fluoride, but can incorporate chloride to a low level.68 SalL, from Salinispora tropica bacterium has 54% sequence similarity to the fluorinase, and in the halide binding pocket, a glycine residue resides in place of a serine. This enzyme shows a strong preference for chlorination and, whilst capable of utilising bromide and iodide, it cannot process fluoride.64 Notable uses of the fluorinase include exploration of its application to 18F incorporation for positron emission tomo-graphy (PET),69 and it\u2019s the utilisation of the fluorinase in parallel with a polyketide synthase to enable synthetic biological access to simple fluorinated polyketides.70 1.4 Biocatalytic potential. The halogenases offer great potential for use as biocatalysts. To realise the application of these important enzymes, the regio-control, -selectivity and reaction rate afforded by the different classes of enzymes is important to consider. The reported exploration of kinetics for the halogenases in the literature is both sparse and varied, and can be challenging to compare due to the different ways in which the data are obtained. We compile a representative overview of the kinetic analyses available for different families of halogenases for a brief comparison between families (Table 1), as well as a glossary of the halogenases that have been structurally characterised so far (Table 2). Haloperoxidases, such as CPO, may be seen to have high turn-over numbers (Kcat 33 None 1 minNone1), yet such catalysts that may be utilised to halogenate a broad series of substrates (see Section 2) lack regio-control. Conversely, the NHFeHals also have a high turn-over number, mediate a highly regio-selective reaction, but the nat-ural reaction that its catalyses is much slower than CPO (Kcat/Km 0.0525 vs. 1.22 mMNone1 minNone1, Table 1). 2. Natural and unnatural aromatic substrate scope for biocatalytic halogenation 2.1 Indolic substrates 2.1.1 Early stage halogenation in biosynthetic pathways. Indoles are commonly utilised motifs in medicine and agro-chemistry, and new tools that enable their chemical diversifica-tion are desirable. There are a series of FDHs that allow for this diversification, via halogenation. Many FDHs mediating the regiospecific halogenation of the indole moiety of tryptophan have been found so far. Most of these enzymes have been found to be involved in the early stages of bioactive natural product synthesis. Such enzymes include PrnA and RebH, tryptophan 7-halogenases, from the first step of the biosynthesis of the antibiotic pyrrolnitrin 24 and the indolocarbazole anticancer agent rebeccamycin 36, respectively.35,43 Tryptophan 6-halogenases include ThdH (alternatively known as ThaI) from the first step of thienodolin 25 biosynthesis, a plant growth promoting compound,71 SttH identified in silico adjacent to an NRPS cluster,72 SatH from Streptomyces albus,73 BorH, a ther-mophilic halogenase from borregomycin 33\u201335 biosynthesis,74 and AfnX responsible for generating the 6-chlorotryptophan precursor of alboflavusin A 26. Alboflavusin is an analogue of the dimeric non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) anti-tumor agent and apoptosis inducing agents, himastatin and chloptosin.75 Though less common so far, 5-chlorotryptophans may also be seen as motifs in natural products. Examples include the antibiotic pyrroindomycin B 27; the first step in the biosynth-esis of this compound is the generation of 5-chlorotryptophan by PyrH.76 Sequence analysis of Xenorhabdus szentirmaii revealed a further flavin dependent tryptophan 5-halogenase XszenFHal. Though the natural function of this halogenase remains unknown, it was demonstrated to be capable of Scheme 4 Nucleophilic halogenation.

Rev., 2021, 50, 9443\u20139481 | 9457regioselectively halogenating a series of indolic and anthranilic substrates.77 The first successful demonstration of the ability to modify the regioselectivity of a FDH was via site directed mutagenesis of tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA. The modification of a large phenylalanine residue in the active site to a smaller alanine allowed for a different binding orientation of tryptophan, leading to halogenation at the 5 position, though it must be noted that halogenation at the 7 position still dominated (2 : 1 ratio of 7-/5-bromination).78 Despite useful changes in selectivity being rare, there are a number of further successes.42,79 Positioning of the lysine residue over the substrate was thought to be critical to site of halogenation. Various studies toward gaining deeper understanding of subtle factors beyond the positioning of the lysine residue in the active site have been carried out, including structural comparison of PyrH, SttH and PrnA, and, specifically, a loop proximal to the active site, informing the design of mutants with modified regiochemistries.80 Modifications to ThaI, to promote chlorination at the 7 position, rather than the 6 position have also been reported.81 Biosynthesis of 4-chlorotryptophan remains a mystery. Although it was isolated from immature pea seedlings in 1970, and postulated to be a precursor to a plant growth hormone,115 the halogenase has not yet been found, hinting that it may be strikingly different to the other, well known FDHs. There have also been fewer reports of natural products containing 2-halotryptophans, perhaps due to their inherent instability. The keramamides 30116 and linked family of jaspamides, chondra-mides 28 are two exceptions, with CmdE implicated in the generation of 2-chlorotryptophan,117 though for this enzyme, no activity with free tryptophan can be shown. It is not clear as to whether lack of observation of production of this species by CmdE is due to the enzyme requiring a different substrate or due to the instability of the product. 2-Chlorotryptophans are very unstable and both the free amine and carboxy groups might be considered to promote dechlorination. Tryptophan halogenases capable of halogenating substi-tuted tryptophans are also known. These include the trypto-phan 6-halogenase KtzR, which acts in tandem with KtzQ in the first steps of kutzneride 29 assembly, installing a second chlorine into the 7-chlorotryptophan that KtzQ generates118 and KrmI, another tryptophan-6-halogenase, which processes 4-hydroxy-tryptophan as its natural substrate, though the wild type enzyme shows ability to process a fairly broad range of Fig. 3 Halogenated natural products arising from the halogenation of indolic substrates: all include regioselective halogenation of tryptophan as a first step in their biosynthesis (tryptophan halogenase name and regiochemistry noted below each corresponding natural product).

KrmI is an unusual halogenase, involved in the biosynthesis of the keramamides 30, this FDH is transla-tionally fused to a ThiF protein119 (Fig. 3). A large variety of symmetrically and asymmetrically halogenated indolocarbazole compounds are known, including the cladonia-mides 31, 32,122 borregomycins 33\u201335,123 and rebeccamycins 36, 37.40 From genomic analysis of the producing organisms, the first step in the biosynthesis of these compounds also involved the generation of 5, 6 or 7-halotryptophan. This biosynthetic logic has been utilised to enable the generation of combinatorial libraries of known and novel compounds in which halogenation and glycosylation patterns are modulated.124 Similar to these compounds are the bisindole alkaloids indimicins and related spiroindimicins 38\u201340 (Fig. 4).125 The tryptophan halogenases have been previously thought to possess only modest innate substrate flexibility. RebH is capable of processing tryptolines, whilst KrmI will halogenate unsubstituted indoles and fluoro-tryptophan.42,119 The tryptophan halogenases continue to be subject to extensive rational reengineering and directed evolution due to their potential as tools for biocatalysis. In addition to studies that explore and modulate factors governing regiocontrol, considerable effort continues to be invested in extending substrate scope.41 Wild-type RebH (the tryptophan 7-halogenase from rebeccamycin 36 biosynthesis) has been demonstrated to be capable of regioselectively halogen-ating a series of indolic (Fig. 5) and arene substrates (Fig. 9).126 Natural substrate scope for the FDHs RebH, GsfI, ThaI and Rdc2 is seen to be a little broader, and these enzymes have capability to process a range of indolic substrates.42 Directed evolution of RebH has been employed by the Lewis group to tune the enzyme for use in 7-44, 6-and 5-chlototryptamine generation enabling quantitative conversions in some instances, and high selectivities.42 Evolved RebH variants have been employed, achieving selective late stage functionalisation of chlorination of sterically bulky substrates, including tricyclic tryptolines 50\u201353 and large indole carbazoles 56, 57, improving conversions of these unnatural substrates as well considerably extending substrate scope from what was previously known (Fig. 4).126,127 Production of halogenated indolic substrates by flavin-dependent halogenases is commonly reported at small scale.47,126,127 The use of Cross-Linked Enzyme Aggregates (CLEAs), in which the physical aggregation of enzymes with a cross-linking agent is mediated, can enable enzyme stabilisation and enhanced yields. By crosslinking RebH and PrnF (the PrnA-related reductase) with glutaraldehyde, Sewald was able to achieve yields on a gram scale with CLEAs for the halogenation of L-tryp-tophan, D-tryptophan and L-5-hydroxytryptophan, establishing the foundations for halogenase biocatalysis on a preparative scale130 (see Section 3). 2.2 Phenolic substrates. Phenolic quinolines attract attention for their many and varied medicinal properties such as antima-larial, antibacterial and anticancer activities.131 Structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) reveal that installation of a chlorine or bromine atom within the quinoline ring of antitubercular quinolines can enhance their activity.131 Beyond antitubercular uses, chlorine-Fig. 4 Naturally occurring halogenated bisindole alkaloids. These compounds incorporate a halogen into tryptophan in the first stage of their biosynthesis. (The tryptophan halogenase responsible and its regioselectivity that it confers, are noted below each natural product.)

While the haloper-oxidases generally confer limited specificity, the FDHs show good levels of regiocontrol for accessing such halogenated compounds. 2.2.1 Early stage halogenation by FDH variant B enzymes. Whilst there has been considerable and detailed investigations of a number of the variant A halogenases that work on substrates that are not covalently tethered to a carrier enzyme (in particular the tryptophan halogenases), fewer in vitro investigations of variant B halogenases have been published. However, a diverse range of bioactive natural products that contain halogenated phenols have been isolated. Here, the operation of variant B FDHs may be seen to be prevalent, and investigations indeed indicate many of the substrates to be enzyme tethered. Halophenol-containing natural products include the actinobacteria-produced aminocoumarins clorobiocin 58 and simocyclinone D8 59. The initial steps of the biosyntheses of these metabolites are postulated to include halogenation of enzyme-tethered tyrosine (mediated by Clo-hal and SimX1, Fig. 5 Representation of some of the diverse substrate scope of tryptophan halogenases. Enzymes include (A) wild-type RebH chlorinating indoles;42,126 (B) evolved RebH 3-SS and RebH 4-V which accept tricyclic tryptoline and large indole carbazoles.127 Scheme 5 Halogenation in the biosynthesis of the phenolic napyradiomycin 76 and merochlorins 77, 78: these natural products are synthesised from polyketide derived tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN), the biosynthesis of these suites of metabolites involve versatile VHPOs and employ a chemical logic of chloronium formation promoting enantioselective intramolecular cyclisation.153,155 Chlorination is indicated in blue.

Vancomycin 62 (VhaA) and teico-planin 61 (Tcp21), are two potent GPAs; again, these compounds contain chlorinated tyrosine residues. In the case of the GPA teicoplanin 61, careful in vitro investigations have shown that Tcp21 accepts the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) supported aminoacyl substrate (tethered tyrosine), but will not accept the dipeptide or extended peptides as substrate.136 In teicoplanin biosynthesis, this amino acid residue is likely to be \u00df hydroxylated at a later stage by a non-heme iron oxygenase, whilst in balhimy-cin biosynthesis OH-Tyr, and not tyrosine, is incorporated by the NRPS machinery.141 Analogues of tyrosine may also be accepted by halogenases. SgcC3 accepts \u00df-tyrosine, probably also in carrier protein tethered form, in the biosynthesis of the enediyne C-1027 64.137 In a similar manner, enzyme tethered 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-L-phenylalanine is seen to be processed to 2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-L-phenylalanine by Pep1 in the first steps of the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin G.142 In chondrochloren 65, 66 biosynthesis, CndH is indicated to process a different, perhaps decarboxylated yet enzyme tethered analogue of tyrosine.36 Fig. 6 Representative bioactive natural products containing halophenol motifs, where the halogen is installed by a variant B FDH. Clorobiocin 58,133 simocyclinone D8 59,134 cryptophycin A 60,135 are all postulated to be generated from the halogenation of an enzyme tethered tyrosine residue, in the first step (halogen added ortho in EAS fashion as mediated by Clo-hal, SimX1 and CrpH respectively). In vitro evidence supporting the early stage halogenation of an enzyme tethered tyrosine exists for teicoplanin 61 and vancomycin 62 (mediated by Tcp21136 and VhaA).136 C-1027 64137 and the chondroclorens 65, 66 are both postulated to arise from the halogenation of an enzyme tethered analogue of tyrosine, in the first stages of the biosynthesis,36,138 whereas a first step of chlorothricin 63 assembly is thought to be the halogenation of enzyme tethered salicylate (catalysed by ChlB4).139 Chlorination is indicated in blue.

Rev., 2021, 50, 9443\u20139481 | 9461Whilst many of the halogenases identified so far are seen to accept electron-rich aromatic amino acids in the biosynthesis of chlorothricin 63, ChlB4 is postulated to act on the small poly-ketide subunit, 6-methyl salicylic acid139 (Fig. 6). 2.2.2 Late stage halogenation by variant A FDHs. Whilst the variant B FDHs are not easily amenable to in vitro investiga-tions, and are indicated to have a very limited substrate scope, the variant A FDHs are less limited by these problems and offer great opportunity for harnessing as biocatalysts. Amongst the most exciting of these, are enzymes that are reported to act at a late stage of the biosynthesis of structurally complex and sterically bulky phenolic/quinolic natural products. Rdc2143 and RadH144 share 87% sequence similarity; these two enzymes are identified to act in the final steps of biosynthesis of the fungal polyketide natural product radicicol 67, an Hsp90 inhi-bitor, within the fungi Pochonia chlamydosporia and Floropilus chiversii respectively. GsfI operates in the final stages of the assembly of griseofulvin 68, a clinically utilised antifungal agent (Fig. 7).145 TiaM from tiacumicin B biosynthesis operates in the final step of the biosynthetic pathway, functionalising a complex and glycosylated polyketide generating both the mono and dihalogenated products.226 CazI, from chaetoviridin A 68 biosynthesis, is postulated to operate on a complex phenolic intermediate, in the final stages of this cytotoxic polyketide.146 In a similar manner, CtcP is seen to halogenate an advanced type II, aromatic polyketides core, in the biosynthesis of chlortetracycline 73.147 Heterologous path-way reconstruction studies indicate that in geodin biosynthesis GedL dichlorinates the advanced PKS metabolite sulochrin, directly affording dihydrogeodin 72.148 Aspirochlorine 70 is an epidithiodiketepiperazine (ETP) toxin, produced by Asper-gullus orizae, a mold used for millennia in Asian cuisine. The first stages of the biosynthesis of aspirochlorine involve the incorporation of two phenylalanines into a symmetric diketo-piperazine (DKP). Intriguingly, one phenylalanine undergoes a C\u2013C cleavage to convert it into glycine. The other phenylalanine is hydroxylated. AclH, operates in the final step of the biosynth-esis, chlorinating the hydroxylated phenylalanine residue and affording the toxin.149 XanH, a bifunctional FDH fused to its concomitant flavin reductase, has been shown capable of regioselectively chlorinating a complex late stage xanthone intermediate on the path to xantholipin 74.150 Pentachlorop-seudilin 71 has a series of interesting biological activities including inhibiting TGF-beta signalling, and impairing angio-genesis; yet its exact biosynthesis remains unclear. HalB was found in a cosmid library of the producing organism; the first halogenase identified from an actinomycetes. Notably, HalB shows 55% sequence identity to the pyrrole FDH PrnC. HalB has been shown to be capable, in vitro, of installing a single halogen into 2-(3,5-dibromophenyl pyrrole), but, whether or not it acts iteratively to install all 5 halogens in both the phenol and pyrrole ring in the natural system remains unclear.151 2.2.3 Late stage halogenation by haloperoxidases. Vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (V-HPOs) have been identified that are involved in the biogenesis of halophenol containing natural products. The napyradiomycins (including napradiomycin B1 76) are polyketide-terpenoid natural products identified in marine streptomycetes, over 50 members of this suite of natural Fig. 7 Halogenated natural products where installation of halogen on a structurally complex non-tethered freestanding phenol is performed selectively by a halogenase: including radicicol 67,143 griseofulvin 68,145 chaetoviridin A 69,146 aspirochlorine 70,149 pentachloropseudilin 71151 dihydrogeodin 72,148 chlortetracycline 73147 and xantholipin 74.150 Chlorination is indicated in blue.

V-HPOs identified within the biosynthetic gene cluster include NapH1, and NapH4. NapH1 is particularly notable, this versatile enzyme acts upon geranylated tetrahydroxynapthalene (THN) derivative, stereose-lectively hydroxylating it whilst mediating regioselective chlorination (Scheme 5). NapT8 and NapH3 operate succes-sively to catalyse prenylation and then an a-hydroxy ketone rearrangement. NapH1 then operates once more to halogenate the newly introduced prenyl unit. The reaction is most likely to proceed via a halonium species, which is then opened by the hydroxyl that NapH1 previously introduced, thereby enabling enantioselective cyclisation. In a similar manner, NapH4 mediates halogenation of the geranyl unit, again most likely proceeding via the halonium species, and promoting intra-molecular cyclisation.152 The complex cyclic scaffolds of the merochlorins 77, 78 are formed using similar chemical logic. Enzymatic total syntheses of napyradiomycin B1 76 has been enabled in 18% yield.153 2.2.4 Substrate scope: phenols. Smaller, freestanding, non-native phenolic substrates have been demonstrated to be processed by variant A FDHs and HPOs (Fig. 8), revealing these enzymes to be useful biocatalysts. The employment of the HPOs, in this context, whilst enabling halogenation of sterically bulky substrates, results in mixtures of regioisomers and poly-halogenated compounds. This is a direct result of most HPOs releasing free hypohalous acid; in this context, the enzyme has little control over the regiochemistry of the transformation, and it is simply the most electron-rich region(s) of the substrate that are halogenated. In contrast, the FDHs usually accept much smaller substrates but are generally highly regioselective. PltM has been shown capable of mono 117 or di-halogenation 118 of phloroglucinol (Fig. 8J), as well as being able to accept resveratrol as a substrate.51 Wild type RebH, GsfI, and ThaI have been shown capable of processing a broad range of non-natural substrates containing phenolic moieties.154 Exceptions may be seen with RadH/Rdc2 and VirX1, FDHs with much more open and accessible active sites, capable of regioselectively monohalogenating much larger phenolic substrates.47,143,144 2.3 Pyrrolic substrates. Substituted pyrroles are also widely used in medicine and agrochemistry. In nature, halogenases may be found that are capable of mono-or poly-halogenating pyrroles. Halopyrrole containing natural products include pyrrolnitrin 24,34 pentachloropseudilin 71,151 chlorizidine A 131,162 hormaomycin 132,163 pyoluteorin 133164 and pyrrolo-mycins 134\u2013137165 (Scheme 6). PrnC, a variant A FDH, chlorinates the pyrrole of 128 in the final step of pyrrolnitrin 24 biosynthesis.34 Here, the pyrrole is generated through the cleavage and rearrangement of 7-chlorotryptophan 127 (Scheme 6). HalB, which shares 45% sequence identity with PrnC, is implicated in halogenating the pyrrole of pentachloro-pseudalin 71.151 For chlorizidine a 131, hormaomycin 132, marinopyrrole 138,166 the pyrrole is formed by oxidation of a proline uploaded onto an acyl carrier protein (ACP), the ACP tethered pyrrole is then halogenated. Bmp2 is one such variant B flavin-dependent pyrrole halogenase, mediating the intriguing tetrabromination of the PCP-bound pyrrole ring, with the introduction of the fourth bromide, to C1, apparently triggering thioesterase mediated release and decarboxylation to restore aromaticity.48 Curiously, the biosynthetically-related halogenase, Bmp5, employs a chemically similar strategy of decarboxylative bromination in the conversion of p-hydroxy-benzoic acid to 2,4-dibromophenol (see Section 1.1.2). Mpy16 from marinopyrrole 138 biosynthesis is structurally similar to Bmp2, yet stops at dihalogenation,166 as do Clz5162 and PltA164 in chlorazidine A 131 and pyoluteorin 133 biosynthesis, respec-tively. Pyr29 is also postulated to di-halogenate an ACP tethered pyrrole 130 in the biosynthesis of the pyrrolomycins,165 whilst HrmQ from hormaomycin 132 biosynthesis mediates monohalogenation.163 Structure-guided mutagenesis has been performed on wild-type Bmp2 to generate a Bmp2 triple mutant (Bmp2-TM) which proceeds no further than dibromination.48 2.4 Aromatic substrate scope beyond indole, phenol and pyrrole. Though the vast majority of natural substrates for the FDHs and haloperoxidases studied so far are indolic, phenolic or pyrrolic in nature, they have been effectively employed in installing halogens into other substrate classes. Generally, once again, the FDHs are seen to confer greater regio-and substrate specificity than the HPOs that generate and release free HOX. Initial reports of wild-type flavin-dependent halogenases had been indicative of a fairly modest and narrow substrate scope. However, RebH, PrnA, PyrH, and SttH have been shown capable of processing a series of anilines including kyuneride 171, anthranilamide to give 172 and, to a lesser extent, anthranilic acid to give 174 (Fig. 9C\u2013F).79,80 These studies also gave insight into factors governing regiospecificity. With PyrH, regiospecific para-chlorination 171 of kynurenine was observed whereas PrnA mediated the formation of the ortho-chlorinated product 166 exclusively, a product that is more chemically challenging to access. PyrH could also be used to achieve the regiospecific para-chlorination 172 of anthranilamide, whereas use of PrnA resulted in a 86% : 14% para : ortho mixture. Mutations could be effectively employed to modulate ortho:para selectivities and improve yields for these unnatural substrates.79 Chlorination of naphthalen-2-amine to give 165 by RebH ortho to \u2013NH2 is achieved in a high yield of 93%.126 The halogenation of sterically bulky substrates can be enabled using haloperoxidases. As there is generally no sub-strate binding site, and free HOX is released, the substrates that can be halogenated using these systems are not limited by size. However, as is usually expected for an HPO that releases HOX, series of regioisomers, as well as mono, di, and tri halogenated compounds result (Fig. 9G).169 For example, heme iron-dependent chloroperoxidase (CPO) from C. fumago has been used to give chlorinated analogues of naphthalene 182, anthracene 183 and pyrenes 185 and 186. A vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase from the marine algae Ascophyl-lum nodosum has also been employed mono and dibromination 4,6,8-trimethylazulene 179 (Fig. 9G), though the instability of the resultant product hindered purification.168 To achieve regioselective electrophilic halogenation, generally FDHs are needed, however, historically these have shown fairly Review Article Chem Soc Rev O pe n A cc es s A rt ic le .

In 2019, new FDHs were revealed that had been found using in silico genome mining approaches (Fig. 9A and B). These halogenases were able to accept much larger substrates and showed a much broader substrate scope than any FDHs examined previously. VirX1, with a preference for iodination, was demonstrated to be capable of regiospecifically iodinating or brominating a diverse portfolio of substrates with a variety of steric and electronic demands, and some of which might be considered to be only weakly activated. Good conversions of a wide range of unnatural substrates are possible with this unusual enzyme from a virus.47 Similar infomatics-led approaches have been utilised by the Sewald and Lewis groups, further demonstrating that natural FDHs do exist with broader substrate scope.170 2.5 Aliphatic substrate scope for biocatalytic halogenation. The NHFeHals functionalise unactivated sp3 carbons. The selective C\u2013H activation that these enzymes are capable of is challenging to achieve using even modern synthetic methodologies. Prior to 1998, these radical halogenases were unknown, however, the observation that the cyanobacterial natural product, barbamide 189, contained a leucine residue with one trihalogenated methyl group, led Willis and co-authors to postulate that the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis perhaps proceeded via a radical mechanism.173 Over half a decade later, SyrB2, from the bio-synthesis of syringomycin E 18246 by Pseudomonas syringae B301D, was the first member of this new family of halogenases to be biochemically and structurally characterised (Scheme 7). Like the FDHs, the NHFeHals may be subdivided into those that operate only on protein tethered substrates (which we call here the variant B NHFeHals, to be consistent with the variant B FDHs that also operate only on protein tethered substrates), and the perhaps more biotechnologically useful, and recently Scheme 6 Naturally occurring halopyrrole containing compounds.

The variant B type NHFeHals have proved challenging to handle requiring anaerobic conditions, never-theless they catalyse series of intriguing chemistries, including cryptic halogenation en route to the installation of cyclopropyl or alkynyl motifs, notable examples may be seen in jamaica-mide 204,61 curacin A 208,174 coronatine 213175 and kutzneride 29 biosynthesis (Scheme 8).118 The need for covalent substrate tethering prior to halogenation means that variant B halogenases have less biotechnological potential at the current time, and will be discussed just briefly in the following section. 2.5.1 Tethered substrates with unactivated sp3 carbon centres.

The discovery of WelO5 from Hapalosiphon welwitschii UTEX B1830, the welwintindolinone A 219 producer, by Liu and coworkers was ground-breaking; for the first time, a NHFeHal could be seen to process non-enzyme tethered substrates. Its regioselective and stereoselective halogenation of a complex carbocycle, renders it an exciting tool for biotechnological applications. WelO5 mono-chlorinates 12-epi-fischerindole U 217 and 12-epi-hapalindole C 220 (Scheme 12),62 and has been demonstrated to enable bromination of the same substrates, leading to their enhanced antibacterial activity.176 Sharing 79% sequence identity with WelO5, AmbO5 was subsequently discovered through the analysis of the ambiguine 53 biosynthetic gene cluster.83,177 AmbO5 accepts a wider scope of substrates than WelO5 and Scheme 7 Bioactive compounds where installation of halogen on a protein-tethered aliphatic substrate is performed selectively by a NHFeHal, including (A) barbamide 189,60 (B) syringomycin E 192,58 (C) armentomycin 196,171 (D) kutzneride 2 29118 and (E) hectochlorin 200.172 Review Article Chem Soc Rev O pe n A cc es s A rt ic le .

Hoebenreich and coworkers used structure-guided direct evolution to develop variants of WelO5 homologue Wi-WelO15 from Westiella intricata HT-29-1 capable of selectively chlorinating non-natural hapalindole 235, and hapalindoles 237\u2013240 containing a ketone moiety at the position of the natural isonitrile.178 Buller and coworkers engineered variants of another homologue WelO5* for selective halogenation at two separate positions on a martinelline analogue 232,179 representing the first successful biocatalytic installation of a halogen by WelO5 type enzymes on a substrate that is notably different to their natural hapalindole targets. Both Buller and Hoebenreich identified amino acid positions, which seem to play an important role in the regioselectivity of these enzymes towards non-natural substrates, opening up possible opportunities for rational re-engineering of these catalysts. The co-crystal structure of WelO5 and native substrate was used in a structural search for other enzymes capable of alkyl halogenation of different substrates. In this manner, the hydro-xylase SadA was identified. Minor modification to the active site and coordination of the FeII (D157GSadA) resulted in an enzyme capable of chlorinating as well as hydroxylating its natural substrate.182 A second series of variant A NHFHals that operate on substrates that are not covalently tethered to a carrier protein (free substrate NHFe halogenases) have recently been Scheme 8 Installation of halogen on protein-tethered aliphatic substrate performed selectively by a NHFeHals, in the biosynthesis of natural products, enabling alkene generation and cyclopropane generation.

Like CurA, CmaB, KtzD (Scheme 8) and JamE, BesD is a cryptic halogenase, and was discovered in the biosynthetic pathway of the amino acid b-ethynylserine 247 (bes) from S. cattleya, after knockouts of non-essential amino acid desaturases pointing towards a novel enzymatic production of the alkyne moiety.183 Purified BesD was shown to selectively chlorinate free lysine 245, producing 4-Cl lysine 246.84 Subsequent C\u2013C cleavage and elimination of the installed chlorine was shown to lead to the terminal alkyne (Scheme 10A). BesD has low sequence identity to both substrate bound SyrB2 (7%) and variant B prototype WelO5 (11%), instead having a much higher identity to predicted hydroxy-lases (446%). Rather than being a standalone enzyme, BesD was shown to be part of a variant A NHFeHals.84 Homology networks were produced from hits arising from a sequence-based homology search of BesD. This approach resulted in the discovery of 20 more halogenases that act on free amino acid substrates. The range of substrates was diverse, with BesD and other enzymes accepting lysine but also ornithine, while the hydrophobic amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and norleucine, Scheme 9 Known substrate scope of wild-type NHFeHals WelO562 and AmbO583 and engineered varieties of WelO15178 and WelO5*.179 Review Article Chem Soc Rev O pe n A cc es s A rt ic le .

A selection of these halogenases was shown to perform along-side amino acid metabolising enzymes to produce chlorinated heterocycles, diamines, and a-keto acids from lysine (SwHalB), ornithine (PkHalD), and norleucine (PrHalE). Remarkably, all enzymes retained fidelity for halogenation over hydroxylation, while the radical halogenase HalB (different to the FDH HalB) from Streptomyces wuyuanensis (SwHalB) was able to accept bromine and azide anions to produce bromo-lysine and azido-lysine. Chlorolysine, generated by SwHalB and PfHalA, could also be incorporated into a 9 amino acid peptide using an in vitro transcription and translation system-suggesting a potential use for these enzymes in production of more complex natural product analogues.84 Recently, variant A NHFHal capable of halogenating nucleo-sides, named AdeV, has been discovered in the biosynthesis of Scheme 10 NHFe halogenases. (A) Known substrate scope of the NHFe halogense BesD and enzymes from the BesD family,84 (B) AdeV chlorination of 9470 | Chem. Soc.

ATCC 39365, opening up the path to access valuable halonucleosides85 (Scheme 10B). AdeV was shown to have 15% similarity to WelO5. Gene knockout experiments confirmed its role in adechlorin biosynthesis. AdeV acts in the early stages of biosynthesis on free nucleoside 20-deoxyadenosine-50-monophosphate (20-dAMP) 258 to generate 20-Cl-20-dAMP. In vitro assays revealed that 20-deoxyadenosine (20-dA), identical to 20-dAMP apart from the 50-phosphate moiety, was not accepted as a substrate, indicating that the presence of this phosphate is essential for substrate binding and halogenation activity. Consistent with this logic, two other phosphorylated nucleosides 20,30-dideoxyadenosine monophosphate 261 and 20deoxyinosine-50-monophosphate (20-dIMP) 263, were accepted by AdeV and converted to their chlorinated counterparts indicating a level of enzyme promiscuity. However, the natural substrate 20-dAMP showed the highest levels of conversion. Several plant species are known to generate halogenated metabolites. The toxin fluoroacetate is produced in many plants including Camellia sinensis (from which tea is generated). Fatty acid derivatives of fluoroacetate such as o-fluorooleic acid accumulating in the seeds of Dichapetalum toxicarium.181 An exciting new NHFe halogenase DAH that performs the stereo-selective late stage chlorination of the complex alkaloid dechlor-oacutimine 265, (Scheme 10C) produced by menispermaceae plants, has been found and its activity demonstrated in vitro. This represents the very first NHFeHal found in plants.181 Phylogenetic analysis indicates that DAH, which has a variant in Menispermaceae canadense (McDAH) and Sinomenium acutum (SaDAH), evolved independently from the previously discussed bacterial NHFeHAls, potentially being an example of parallel evolution in halogenated natural product metabolism. In vitro assays against a wide range of alkaloids indicated that DAH was highly selective towards its natural substrate, with no other small molecules being accepted for halogenation. As with some other halogenases, DAH was shown to accept azide anions as well as halides, and convert (None)-dechloroacutumine to 11-azido-dechloroacutumine. Beyond the NHFe halogenases, alkyl halides can be generated by a series of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases. An elegant cyclisation cascade is initiated by the selective bromination of a single alkene within a terpenoid; the resultant bromonium undergoes ring opening affording the alkyl bromide. For example, the vanadium bromoperoxidase from C. officinalis brominates the terpenoid precursor (E)-(+)nerolidol 267, yielding cyclised snyderols 268-230.184 For b-and g-snyderol, a single diastereo-isomer is produced. This provides an exciting biocatalytic oppor-tunity as synthetic methods have succeeded only in forming a mixture of two diastereoisomers of each product (Scheme 11). In a similar manner, chlorination, mediated by haloperoxidases, may be seen to generate chloronium species, initiating cyclisation cascades. Installation of chlorine onto the aliphatic moiety of SF2415B1 by NapH1 allows cyclisation of the structure to afford a cyclic ether, offering potential for synthesis of napyradiomycins 76 (Scheme 5) with cytotoxic and antibacterial properties.155 Notably, a small number of FDHs process aliphatic compounds. One such example is CmlS, an FDH from chloramphenicol biosynthesis implicated, through in vivo studies, in the generation of a dichloroacetyl moiety.185 In this unusual FDH, the flavin cofactor is covalently linked to the enzyme. The malonyl-CoA substrate is proposed to form an enolate, stabilised through hydrogen bonding to tyrosine, this species may then react with a proximal chloramine.44 Beyond the halogenation of tethered malonyl-CoA by CmlS, other exciting observations of the applica-tions of these enzymes are noted. Intriguingly, an FDH from a fungus, AoiQ, has been demonstrated to regioselectively chlorinate an unactivated terminal sp3 carbon of a freestanding molecule 271, in the biosynthesis of orthosporin (Scheme 12). So far, AoiQ is unique amongst other flavin-dependent halogenases in its ability to perform this task. Although the mechanism for this reaction is unknown, it has been postulated by Hertweck and coworkers that, though it is a FDH, it may proceed via a radical reaction.186 Notably, like KrmI, it is one of the few fused halogenases to be explored. In the case of AoiQ, it contains a functional O-methylation domain. The mystery as to how it operates remains to be revealed. 3. Approaches toward improved biocatalytic halogenation, and steps toward upscaling Considerable effort has been invested into engineering and evolving the biocatalytic activity of halogenases. Studies have predominantly focussed upon the FDHs in order to alter substrate profiles, modify regiochemistries of halogenation and enhance biocatalytic stability. Greater structural under-standing of these enzymes has enabled progress to be made in their rational redesign.187,188 Such approaches combined Scheme 11 V-BrHPO catalysed terpene bromination and cyclisation This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021Chem.

The broad range of halogenated structures that have been noted, over 5000 to date,13 together with the variety of organisms from which they are produced, indicates that many diverse halogenases remain to be discovered. In silico discovery approaches have been utilised to mine for various halogenases within uncurated genomic deposits, leading to the discovery of more substrate flexible halogenases from diverse sources including viruses.47,170 Discovery of novel halogenases remains at the forefront of biocatalytic halogenation research. For effective biocatalysis, good amounts of soluble protein are required. The Lewis group have effectively improved heterologous production of RebF through including a cleavable maltose binding protein (MBP) tag, to enhance solubility of the enzyme, and co-expressing both the halogenase and the concomitant reductase, RebF with the chaperonins GroEL/ES, in addition to developing a cofactor recycling system.126 Advances on FADH2 regeneration have recently been achieved by replacing NADH with synthetic mimics.191 A photocatalytic approach has been successfully applied to the VHPOs. The Gulder group cleverly demonstrated that by illuminating their biocatalytic system with 455 nm light, and including sacrificial electron donors, cofactor recycling could be addressed, and a ready supply of reduced cofactor afforded in a relatively inexpensive manner.192,193 An approach that has made a significant difference to the utilisation of FDHs is the application of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA). FDHs generally have poor stability, impacting their catalytic longevity and utility in scaled up reactions. The robust nature and solvent tolerance of Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals was first reported in the early 1990s, but the technique required the enzymes of interest to first be crystalised.194 The application of CLEA was first demonstrated for PenAcylase, an aminoacylase utilised in the generation of ampicillin, where CLEA were generated from precipitating, rather than crystallising, the enzyme prior to cross-linking.195 By using a CombiCLEAS approach of 1 g of L-tryptophan to 1.8 g of L-7-Br-tryptophan could be achieved with complete conversion within an 8 days period.130 To achieve this, the lysate from Escherichia coli (E. coli) (6 L), that had been grown with a RebH expression vector, was combined with PrnF, the flavin reductase from Pseudomonas fluorescens, and an alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus sp., that had been precipitated with ammonium sulfate, was then cross-linked with 0.5%/wt glutaraldehyde to form the CombiCLEAS. 4. Site selective C\u2013H activation through hyphenation of enzymatic halogenation and synthetic diversification The opportunity to combine enzymatic halogenation with chemical modification, in particular catalytic cross-coupling, is exciting and provides a much-needed tool for molecule constructions. This concept, first reported in 2010, with the tryptophan halogenase PrnA being utilised to give access to a new to nature haloindolic natural product, which was subsequently functionalised through Suzuki\u2013Miyaura cross-coupling,196 has been gaining momentum. This section comprehensively reviews the current state-of-the-art and reflects on technologies enabling the hyphenation. 4.1 Aqueous compatible cross-coupling methodologies. Palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions play a central role in organic chemistry. Their utility in the formation of C\u2013C and carbon\u2013heteroatom bonds under mild conditions with a wide range of organic halide and nucleophilic reagents, has led to them being one of the most utilised series of reactions in the pharmaceutical industry.197 As with almost all enzymes, the halogenases require an aqueous environment for effective operation. To effectively couple enzymatic halogenation with synthetic diversification, aqueous compatible reaction conditions are generally required. Palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions have largely utilized traditional organic solvents. Standard conditions for these coupling methodologies typically use a mixed organic/aqueous base solvent system, hence the development of water solubilising ligands have been highly enabling. The first example of a water-soluble palladium catalyst for cross-coupling reactions being reported by Casalnuovo,198 and significant effort has been devoted to the development of hydro-philic palladium/ligand complexes for aqueous-phase catalysis since this seminal work, as well as active hydrophobic catalysts and ligand-free species based on palladium nanoparticles.199\u2013203 The development of mild cross coupling conditions for the modulation of challenging and or functionally sensitive com-pounds is advancing, enabling the diversification and tuning of small molecules, natural products and biomolecules including nucleic acids and peptides. To this end, aqueous compatible and water soluble ligands such as TPPTS 274,199 and the sterically demanding and electron-rich TXPTS 275,199 sSPhos 276,204 SXPhos 277204 and disodium 2-aminopyrimidine-4,6-diol 278205\u2013207 have proved valuable (Fig. 10). Additionally, nitrogen based ligands enabling aqueous compatible cross-couplings such as tetramethylguanidine 279 and 2-(dimethylamino)-pyrimidine-4,6-diol 280, both reported to have low cell toxicity, are beginning Fig. 10 Selected water-soluble ligands used for aqueous Suzuki\u2013Miyaura cross-coupling reactions in the presence of halogenase enzymes or even living systems.

Rev., 2021, 50, 9443\u20139481This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021to facilitate tandem halogenation and cross-coupling strategies in living systems.208 Specifically, with the goal of enabling C\u2013H activation through enzymatic halogenation and chemical cross-coupling, our team has developed series of aqueous cross-coupling procedures, enabling the cross-coupling to be compatible with molecules decorated with sensitive functional groups, as well as with enzymes and even in live cell environments. We have initiated our development of these catalytic conditions by focussing on challenging free and unprotected halotrypto-phans. Our choice has been directed by three factors: \u2013 The availability of a well-characterised series of tryptophan halogenases that may be utilised in standalone format in conjunction with a biosynthetic pathway to access halotrypto-phans and synchronously new-to-nature halotryptophan containing natural products; \u2013 The utility of tryptophan as a fluorescence tag and a moiety that governs protein folding, and the attraction to being able to tune these properties; \u2013 And the challenge that free tryptophan confers, rendering it a suitably stimulating test bed. We reasoned that by developing conditions that were suitable to address the cross-coupling of free halotryptophan, a small molecule with the propensity to coordinate to the catalyst and render it inactive, such conditions could be readily applied to other more tractable moieties. To this end, we developed a range of aqueous conditions enabling the Suzuki\u2013Miyaura,209 Heck,210 Sonogashira,211 keto-arylation212 and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig213 diversification of free unprotected tryptophan, peptides, and natural products (Scheme 13). The development of mild aqueous chemistries has facilitated chemo-enzymatic and GenoChemetic approaches. Site selective C\u2013H activation is enabled by a halogenase and synthetic diversi-fication carried out, in some cases synchronously, through aqueous compatible Pd mediated catalysis. More reactive aryl iodides and bromides can be coupled under much milder conditions than their less activated chloro counterparts. 4.2 Chemo-enzymatic approaches. Hyphenation of enzymatic halogenation and synthetic derivatisation has been enabled by steering, where possible, to enzymatic bromination (or even iodina-tion) over enzymatic chlorination, employing combinations of stabilised or partitioned enzymes, and use of mild and aqueous cross-coupling methodologies. There is burgeoning interest in employing such strategies as powerful methods for late-stage diversification on ever more complex molecules. The approach is also utilised to enable a fast fluorescence assay for enzyme screening and for directed evolution. A few enzymes, such as RadH have been shown capable of halogenating 7-hydroxycoumarin. An enhancement in fluorescence occurs when 7-hydroxycoumarin (lmax 325 nm) is converted to 8-chloro-7-hydroxycoumarin (lex 386 nm/lem 456 nm). 144 In most halogenation reactions, a clear change in fluorescence is not always observable, and cross-coupling chemistry has been employed to provide a fluorescence readout that may be used to assay halogenase activity. Sewald reported the utilisation of tryptophan 5-, 6-and 7-halogenases PyrH, ThaI, and RebH for bromination of L-tryptophan substrate.214,215 The team then employed aqueous cross-coupling conditions. To achieve cross-coupling of the bromo-tryptophan product within the crude lysate, the Pd-catalyst loading was further increased to 50 mol%. By reaction with the boronic acid of aniline, the products (30-aminophenyl)-tryptophans were reported to have a lex 300 nm/lem 430 nm (Scheme 14B). This technology was utilised for microtitre plate screening enabling rapid analysis of ThaI mutants that had been generated by error-prone PCR.215 The Sewald team also cleverly employed CLEA technology (see Section 3) to enable bromination of tryptophan by these same halogenases PyrH, ThaI, and RebH. Not only did the utilisation of enzyme aggregates afford stabilisation, but it also provided an opportunity for readily filtering off the enzymes ahead of Suzuki\u2013 Miyaura diversification of the resultant halotryptophans. By utilis-ing a three-step approach, organic solvents required for solubilisa-tion of several of the substrates could be used, with Boc protection being carried out in a final step, thereby easing purification.214 In a similar manner, the Sewald group developed a three-step one pot reaction utilising RebH and Mizoroki\u2013Heck chemistry for the further diversification of tryptophans. Again, by using their combi-CLEA system in a stepwise manner (Scheme 14D), the harsher reaction conditions required for Heck diversification could be utilised and enabled the generation of C-7 substituted styryl-tryptophan with a lem of 485 nm (lex 360 nm), and Stokes shift of 7159 cmNone1.216 This larger Stokes\u2019 shift renders this technology potentially very useful for molecule tagging and enzyme assay, as well as valuable for molecule diversification. Even when stabilised as CLEA, enzymes and Pd catalysts can have poor compatibility. To achieve a synchronous one-pot enzymatic halogenation and chemical cross-coupling, and to avoid the additional filtration step, Micklefield and co-workers elegantly partitioned CLEA stabilised PyrH, RebH, RadH and SttH from the Pd catalyst through use of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane. Whilst the brominated enzymatic product could pass through the PMDS, it was reported to be impervious to the enzymes and cofactors. The cross-coupled product, once formed, remained in the chemo-catalytic chamber (Scheme 14G).218 Though the majority of chemo-enzymatic approaches published so far have focussed on tryptophans and other indolic systems, this is predominantly a reflection of the most extensively studied FDHs. Through substrate walking method-ology, Jared Lewis and co-workers have impressively evolved RebH to work on substrates that are chemically distinct from its natural tryptophan substrate. Utilisation of evolved halo-genases enabled bromination of a diverse series of substrates including tryptolines, sterically bulky substituted anilines as well as carvediol and pindolol, two clinically utilised beta-blockers. Conditions to enable Suzuki\u2013Miyaura, Buchwald\u2013 Hartwig amination and alkoxylation were developed and applied mostly to the chlorinated and brominated intermediates as a component of a crude extract, resulting in high yields of the respective products 284\u2013289 (Scheme 13D\u2013F).189 With the discovery of more substrate diverse halogenases, engineering of known halogenases, enzyme stabilisation and partitioning strategies and the development of milder reaction conditions, Review Article Chem Soc Rev O pe n A cc es s A rt ic le .

Excitingly, a nanobiohybrid was also generated using GOx as a support for palladium nanoparticles, which led to good yields of stepwise halocycliza-tion and Suzuki coupling.221 4.3 GenoChemetic approaches. Whilst in an enzymatic or whole cell biotransformation where the enzymes or cells are exogenously supplemented with substrates, in a GenoChemetic approach, the substrate and tagged intermediates are fully biosynthesised by an engineered organism. GenoChemetic processes provide an expeditious route to generating series of analogues of natural products. Semi-synthesis, though a useful tool, is limited by the innate functional groups naturally present within the molecule. GenoChemetics addresses this. It involves the introduction of a gene to complement a biosyn-thetic pathway, such that a chemically reactive and orthogonal handle is introduced into the natural product. This handle enables synthetic diversification of the natural product. There are so far three reports of the utilisation of halogenases within GenoChemetic systems. In each of these systems, tryptophan halogenases have been employed, with RebH, PyrH, and PrnA being installed into either pathway engineered or wild-type strains enabling the production of chlorinated or brominated analogues of the complex natural product scaffolds. The halogenated metabolites have been subjected to cross-coupling chemistries. In the first example, the tryptophan halogenase PrnA was installed, through use of an integrative vector, into the genome of Streptomyces coeruleorubidis. It was demonstrated that there was no need to introduce PrnA\u2019s concomitant flavin reductase, as the organism\u2019s own reductases sufficed. A chlorinated analogue of pacidamycin, a uridyl peptide antibiotic, was produces at a titre of B1 mg LNone1. In spite of bearing series of sensitive functional groups, this metabolite could be readily cross-coupled using the moderately mild Suzuki-Miyaura conditions that were developed. The cross-coupling was carried out both on the purified material and on material as a component of a crude extract (Scheme 15). The latter was preferable, as the more lipophilic product that resulted was much more readily amenable to purification.217 The generation of brominated analogues would, of course, facilitate cross-coupling under even milder conditions. However, Strepto-myces coeruleorubidis was found to be sensitive to bromide salts, and the brominated analogue cannot readily be accessed through use of this strain. Streptomyces coelicolor showed good tolerance to bromide salts in a screen of series of potential heterologous expression hosts, and so the pacidamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, identified previously, was ported into this strain conferring it with the ability to produce pacidamycins. The gene encoding the halogenase PrnA was engineered into the strain and ability to produce bromo-pacidamycin was confirmed. In order to enable bromometabolite production and cross-coupling synchronously, mild cross-coupling reactions that enabled derivatisation of 7-Br-pacidamycin D 305 in the presence of the living culture were carried out. In a similar manner, E. coli was engineered with the ability to make bromo-tryptophan and its cross-coupling to 306 affected in the living fermentative culture.222 A similar system was designed in hairy root cultures of Catharanthus roseus in which they were engi-neered to include RebH, PyrH and their concomitant reductases. This led to the production of a range of chlorinated and brominated analogues of the plant\u2019s monoterpene indole alkaloid natural products 299\u2013301, which were successfully extracted and coupled in non-aqueous Suzuki\u2013Miyaura couplings, either as crude extracts or purified compounds (Scheme 15A).223,224 Conclusions Though enzyme mediated halogenation was initially considered to be nothing more than an artefact or a rare event, today over 30 enzymes capable of mediating such chemistry have been structurally and biochemically characterised (Table 2), and an even greater number subject to in vitro and in vivo investigation. Halogenated compounds play a major role in the construction of molecules via cross-coupling methodologies, as well as making up a large percentage of medicinally and agrochemically relevant molecules. In a world that seeks more selective, greener and more sustainable solutions to molecule manufacture, halo-genases hold an opportunity. They also offer potential for the vectorisation of fragments for SAR. Whilst the kinetic analyses of the halogenases is rather potted, drawing this data together is useful in identifying potential halogenases for development and use in biotransformations. Whilst the HPOs are capable of mediating halogenation of large and sterically demanding sub-strates, as most neither bind the substrate nor the electrophilic species, such systems generally lack regiocontrol. A few intriguing departures from this trend have been identified from marine systems, indicating that there is much more to learn about these enzymes, their operation and evolution. New variant A FDHs with reasonable catalytic efficiency and broad substrate scopes have been revealed in the last two years, enabling regioselective chlorination, bromination and even iodination on sterically and electronically demanding aromatic systems, even prior to rational redesign or evolution. Excitingly, in recent years the range of variant A NHFeHals that enable the controlled halogenation, including stereoselective halogenation, have been identified; clearly, there are many more such systems awaiting discovery. Inspired by such systems, it may be possible to generate artificial architectures that, perhaps via haloamines, position and deliver electrophilic halogenating agents to substrates held in the required position to affect desired regiochemistries. Halogenation introduces a chemically reactive, chemically orthogonal moiety into a compound. This single atom modification, that can be genetically/enzymatically installed has the potential to act as a superior tag to azide or alkyne Review Article Chem Soc Rev O pe n A cc es s A rt ic le .

        "The enzymatic generation of carbon\u2013halogen bonds is a powerful strategy used by both nature and synthetic chemists to tune the bioactivity, bioavailability and reactivity of compounds, opening up the opportunity for selective C\u2013H functionalisation. Genes encoding halogenase enzymes have recently been shown to transcend all kingdoms of life. These enzymes install halogen atoms into aromatic and less activated aliphatic substrates, achieving selectivities that are often challenging to accomplish using synthetic methodologies. Significant advances in both halogenase discovery and engineering have provided a toolbox of enzymes, enabling the ready use of these catalysts in biotransformations, synthetic biology, and in combination with chemical catalysis to enable late stage C\u2013H functionalisation. With a focus on substrate scope, this review outlines the mechanisms employed by the major classes of halogenases, while in parallel, it highlights key advances in the utilisation of the combination of enzymatic halogenation and chemical catalysis for C\u2013H activation and diversification.",
        "Introduction Halogenated organic compounds play an important role in society. In the agrochemical sector, a staggering 96% of herbi-cides, fungicides, insecticides, acaricides and nematicides pro-duced since 2010 contain halogen atoms.1 Such compounds are valuable commodities; for example, the top-selling insecticide imidacloprid (Fig. 1A) 1 had sales of 1.09 billion USD in 2011 alone,2 and in 2013, 50% of marketed top drugs contain",

        "The incorporation of a carbon\u2013halogen bond is a regularly employed strategy in medicinal and agro-chemistry. Due to bond polarisation and the ability to form highly directional halogen bonds to electron-rich oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and aromatic rings, halogen incorporation may be used to enhance stability, and increase lipophilicity which in turn can influence bioavailability and modulate compound bioactivity.8 Beyond these applications, series of fluorinated and iodinated compounds are used in radiotherapy and biomedical imaging.9,10 Halogenation is also central to molecule construction and manufacture.

        "1. Mechanisms for biocatalytic halogenation Enzymatic halogenation is classified mechanistically in accordance with whether the halogen is introduced by an electrophilic, nucleo-philic, or radical halide species, with the vast majority of the enzymes that have been discovered so far, being electrophilic halogenases, mediating oxidation of the halogen to generate a reactive electrophilic species. There is further subdivision within the broader halogenase categories, based on the exact catalytic species and cofactor which enables halogen oxidation. 1.1 Electrophilic (X+) halogenation 1.1.1 Haloperoxidases. Haloperoxidases are defined as enzymes that utilise hydrogen peroxide and chloride, bromide or iodide to generate HOX. These enzymes are named in accordance with the most electronegative halogen for which they can affect oxidation. Haloperoxidases are generally the least regioselective of the enzymes enabling halogenation; catalysing the generation of free hypohalous acid, which in all but a few cases, is released by the enzyme. The earliest reported studies of halogenation enabled by an enzyme date back to 1959, when Lowell Hager discovered a haloperoxidase (HPO) from the fungus Calariomyces fumago.14 The enzyme that Hager had utilised as part of a lysate was named chloroperoxidase or (CPO) and was shown to be capable of affecting dichlorination of 1,3-cyclopentanedione 12. It has thus been postulated to be",
        "involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic caldariomycin 14 (Scheme 1C).15 CPO may be described more specifically as a heme iron-dependent haloperoxidase, a subset of haloperox-idases that contain a heme-iron cofactor coordinated to an axial cysteine ligand within the enzyme. Hydrogen peroxide binds axially to heme-Fe(III) in its resting state to form a None+heme-Fe(IV)QO intermediate, denoted compound I.23 Addition of halide to the ferryl oxygen produces a heme-Fe(III)\u2013OX species (Scheme 1A, IV). Free hypohalous acid, HOX, is generated which reacts with an electron-rich substrate (Scheme 1A).24 Generation of electrophilic X+ allows halogenation of electron-rich compounds by electrophilic aromatic substitution, generally at the most reactive site(s) within the substrate. CPO has been used biocatalytically to mediate the chlorination, bromination or iodination of a variety of electron-rich substrates (see Section 2), however, as it lacks a site to position the substrate, no regiocontrol beyond that conferred by the electronics of the substrate is observed. The vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (V-HPOs) operate by an analogous mechanism, again generating and, mostly releasing, free hypohalous acid. This subcategory of haloperox-idase is widely found in algae, fungi and bacteria, and utilises a vanadium cofactor bound by an axial histidine ligand.25 In the resting state, the cofactor is in a trigonal bipyramidal configu-ration (Scheme 1B, V), a distal H2O2 displaces two hydroxyl ligands giving rise to formation of the known Z2-peroxido complex (Scheme 1B, VII), with the distorted square pyramidal geometry.

        "9447trigonal bipyramidal geometry (Scheme 1B, VIII) is observed. The resulting V\u2013OX species undergoes hydrolysis to generate electrophilic X+ in the form of free HOX.26 Electrophilic aromatic substitution occurs, as in the case with heme-iron haloperoxidases.27 A notable difference with the heme iron-dependent biocatalytic cycle is that the vanadium centre main-tains its oxidation state throughout the process.28 Haloperoxidases had initially been considered to lack significant enzyme-mediated selectivity due to the release of freely diffusible hypohalous acid. The free electrophilic species allows halogenation at the most electron-rich carbon, and a mixture of mono-, di-and tri-substituted products can often be observed. Detection of the free HOX through reaction with nucleophilic monochlorodimedone (MCD) 15 has previously been used to assay for haloperoxidase activity (Scheme 1D).29 However, for a number of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases, substrate, regio-and even stereo-specific halogenation is evident, as noted in the biosynthesis of napyradiomycins 76,30 and merochlorins 77, 78.31 (Scheme 5). Currently, the exact mechanistic rationale for this specificity is not known. Here, free HOCl is notably not detected in assay with MCD.31 It is thus postulated that residues within the enzyme might transiently support the electrophilic HOCl, whilst the electron-rich substrate is appropriately and proximally positioned. Moore invokes the involvement of an active site lysine forming a haloamine, in a manner analogous to the FDHs.31,32 Though NapH1 from napyr-adiomycin biosynthesis is associated with the first chlorination event, this enzyme is also capable of mediating nonspecific bromination through generation and release of HOBr. Greater understanding of the mechanism enabling selective halogenation by these series of enzymes would be valuable, potentially enabling informed discovery of further enzymes with biotechnological potential.",
        "1.1.2 Flavin-dependent halogenases. The haloperoxidases remained the only known halogenases for several decades until in 1995, the first of a second series of halogenases, the flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs), Chl from 7-chlortetracycline 73 biosynthesis in Streptomyces aureofaciens was revealed in a study by Dairi.33 The enzyme was implicated as being involved in chlorination with knockouts of the gene encoding Chl lacking halogenated product. However, from these initial stu-dies, it was not fully apparent that this new series of enzymes were flavin-dependent, only a partial protein sequence lacking 100 amino acids at the N-terminal end including the flavin binding site. In vitro analysis of the tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA, by van Pe\u0301e and co-workers, demonstrated the powerful regioselectivity of this new class of halogenase and the requirement for both flavin and molecular di-oxygen.34,35 The FDHs can be separated into those acting on free substrates (variant A), and those requiring their substrate to be covalently tethered to a carrier protein via a phosphopan-tatheine linker (variant B).36 The most extensively investigated and engineered FDHs are the tryptophan halogenases, variant A FDHs enabling regioselective halogenation of tryptophan at the 5, 6 or 7 positions. The first structural insights as to how",
        "FDHs mediate their exquisite regioselectivity were revealed by van Pe\u0301e and Naismith.37 However, 15 years on and debate still remains as to the exact way in which these enzymes function. Details as to which residues within the active site participate may vary from one enzyme to another. The mechanisms proposed by Walsh38 and van Pe\u0301e39 for the flavin dependent tryptophan halogenase are presented in Scheme 2B and C. Reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2), (Scheme 2A, I) and dioxygen in the presence of chloride, bromide or iodide are utilised by these enzymes to catalyse C\u2013H to C\u2013X. Freely diffusible FAD binds to a conserved GxGxxG motif. The reduced cofactor, FADH2, (Scheme 2A, II) reacts with molecular oxygen to form FAD(C4a)\u2013OOH (III), which subsequently reacts with a nucleophilic halide releasing HOX and FAD(C4a)\u2013OH (Scheme 2A, IV).40 Unlike haloperoxidases, the HOX generation and electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) events are spatially separated by a B10 \u00c5 tunnel. At the end of this tunnel is a conserved lysine, proposed by Walsh to react with the HOX thereby forming a haloamine intermediate, guiding the regio-chemistry of halogenation. (Scheme 2B).38 Mutation of this lysine residue to alanine, across a series of halogenases including RebH, PrnA, and Rdc2, results in loss of activity.41 In a subtly different mechanism, van Pe\u0301e invokes a proximal glutamate residue, as well as the lysine residue binding to HOX, thereby activating it and positioning it (Scheme 2C).39 In both models, the electrophilic halogenating species is directed towards the substrate, promoting a regioselective EAS reaction. The exact mechanism and halogenating species remain elusive. Mutation of this active site glutamate to glutamine in PrnA results in a drop in rate by two orders of magnitude.37 This glutamate is not present in the more electron-rich phenol halogenases. A different proposed role for this active site glutamate, invoked in deprotonation of the Wheland intermediate indole benzo ring in the tryptophan halogenases, is that it perhaps plays a role in reducing the activation energy of halogenation of these less electron-rich species.41 Notably no kinetic isotope effect is observed for halogenation of tryptophan by RebH.42 These FDHs share a similar flavin binding domain to the flavin-dependent monoxygenases, and though most utilise free and diffusible FAD, which is converted to FADH2, variants exist where the flavin is covalently bound to the enzyme, such as in the case of CmlS involved in chloramphenicol biosynthesis.44 Naturally, most FDHs are usually provided the reduced flavin by a partner flavin reductase that utilises NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD to generate reduced FADH2. 35 The partner flavin reductase can be readily substituted for any other capable of producing FADH2. Single component FDHs, that have this reductase function present within the one protein, also exist; the first discovered example of such an enzyme was Bmp5.45 This enzyme shows other notable differences to all previously studied FDHs; in analogy to the decarboxylative hydroxylation observed for a single component monooxygenase, decarboxylative dibromination of 18 occurs (Fig. 2F).45 Other intriguing variations of the FDHs also exist, recently, the first of a new class of zinc-binding FDHs, MalA from the biosynthesis of the malbrancheamides 21 and 22 (Fig. 2G) was reported.",

        "2021This remarkable enzyme is capable of mediating the late stage dichlorination of 5, and 6 positions of the indole benzo ring of pre-malbrancheamide 20, a complex prenylated indole alkaloid. In the first step, positions 5 and 6 appear to be halogenated with comparable rates, perhaps due to increased electron density, the second halogenation even occurs far more quickly. Within the enzyme, the active site glutamate is seen proximal to the NH of the indole. It is clearly implicated in deprotonating this moiety, rendering the substrate more nucleophilic, and whilst mutation of this glutamate to aspartate results in low but observable activity, mutation to glutamine renders the enzyme inactive.46 FDHs contain multiple sequence motifs; a series of amino acid residues integral for enzyme activity or structure, that are generally conserved throughout all FDHs. These are a dinucleotide-binding motif GxGxxG, part of the Rossman fold allowing for binding of flavin and NAD(P)H,49 and a tryptophan motif WxWxIP, suggested to block binding of substrate near the bound cofactor, thus preventing a monooxygenation reaction instead of halogenation.37 It is notable though, that GxGxxG,",

A complementary and overlapping motif FX[DE]PX[EFL] was subsequently identified by Lewis and coworkers.157 Notably, almost all halogenases studied, until recently, have been identified from bacteria and fungi, most being found due to their implication in the biosynthesis of a specific natural product or series of natural products.

        "2021analogously, non-heme iron a-ketoglutarate (KG)-dependent (NHFe) halogenases (NHFeHals) may well have evolved from their hydroxylase counterparts. Understanding of the catalytic cycle mediated by the NHFeHals is informed by the studies of the hydroxylases, which also require a non-heme iron centre, a-KG and O2 to function (Scheme 3). The catalytic cycle may notionally be considered to start with octahedral FeII coordinated in a bidentate fashion by a-KG, and a weakly bound water ligand that is subsequently replaced by molecular oxygen. The remaining three positions, a \u2018\u2018facial triad,\u2019\u2019 in hydroxylases, consists of two histidine residues and the carboxylate of either an aspartate or glutamate residue at the active site.53 In halogenases, this carboxylate residue is usually found to be replaced by either an alanine or glycine, thereby enabling the halogen ion to coordinate at this vacant coordination site (Scheme 3, I). It has been shown that the weakly bound axial water ligand is initially displaced by substrate binding, triggering the subsequent reaction of II with molecular oxygen.54 Oxidative decarboxylation of III affords trigonal bipyramidal IV, with succinate coordinated, and is the driving force for the catalysis. This high valent, high energy FeIV-oxido species is capable of abstracting HNone from an otherwise unactivated alkyl group.55 The regio-selectivity of abstraction is governed by how the substrate is positioned within the enzyme\u2019s active site. Selectivity for reaction of generated substrate radical with Fe(III)\u2013X bond, leading to the desired halogenation over the Fe(III)\u2013OH bond, which would lead to hydroxylation, is thought to be controlled by careful substrate positioning over FeIII species V.56 In HctB, a NHFeHal from hectochlorin biosynthesis, residues such as the Glu223 and Arg254 are thought to influence the charge density of the chlorine ligand, and are thus postulated to further promote halogenation.57 The resultant alkyl radical proceeds to extract XNone from V, returning the metal centre to its FeII state. Significant conformational changes are observed within these NHFe proteins. These changes are postulated to occur directly after oxygen binding and the subsequent decarboxylation event, orientating the substrate for the observed regioselective halo-genation. Crystal structures of WelO5 with NO (an O2 analogue) reveal a significant change in conformation. Initially, NHFeHals",
        "appeared to be difficult to handle in vitro due to oxygen sensitivity of the Fe(II) core,58 however, recent advances suggest an iron-reconstitution step can be performed to activate enzymes purified aerobically.59 The majority of NHFeHals, such as SyrB1,58 BarB1 and BarB2,60 and CurA halogenase,61 like the variant B FDHs, all required the substrate to be presented on carrier proteins, tethered via a phosphopantatheine linker (Ppant). In 2014, WelO5 was discovered, becoming the first member of a new family of NHFeHals (that we will refer to as variant A NHFeHals), which act on freestanding substrates.62 Excitingly, these open up the possibility for using such proteins more readily in biotransformations. 1.3 Nucleophilic (XNone) halogenation. Though the C\u2013F bonds are prevalent in pharmaceuticals, and fluorine is the most abundant of the halogens on earth, few fluoro-metabolites are known. So far, 13 fluorometabolites, 7 of these being closely related fluorinated lipids, have been discovered. The bacterium Streptomyces cattleya is known to biosynthesise three of this limited portfolio of fluorinated metabolites: fluoroacetate, 4-fluorothreonine, and (2R,3S,4S)-trihydroxy-5-fluoropentanoic acid. These compounds are generated by the \u2018\u2018fluorinase,\u2019\u2019 more formally named adenosyl fluoride synthase or FlA, that was discovered by O\u2019Hagan and co-workers.63 FlA is closely related to the more recently discovered SalL, an enzyme that mediates chlorination in salinosporamide biosynthesis.64 These enzymes are members of a rare group of nucleophilic halogenases, all of which utilise S-adenosyl-L-methionine 23 (SAM) as substrate. Streptomyces calvus is capable of biosynthe-sising a fourth bacterial fluorometabolite, nucleocidin.65 Intriguingly, a gene with similarity to that which encodes the fluorinase is absent from the genome of this organism implying that a further group of halogenases capable of mediating C\u2013F bond formation exists. The dearth of fluoro-metabolites found in nature may perhaps be attributed to a number of factors. With the high electronegativity of fluorine, the possibility of oxidation to generate a fluorous electrophile or even a fluorous radical is energetically challenging, and no enzymes have so far shown this capability. Also, fluoride, though abundant, is generally present in minerals such as fluorospar (fluorite), which have high lattice energies and poor solubilities. Once in solution, fluoride is surrounded by a sheath of water, its high enthalpy of hydration (490 kJ molNone1) precludes ready displacement of the water molecules to access the naked fluoride ion required for nucleophilic attack.66 The nucleophilic halogenases characterised so far all operate by holding the halide proximal to the electrophile, SAM. Crystal-lographic studies of the fluorinase reveal a small pocket, the fluoride binding site, giving insight into how displacement of the hydration sphere might be achieved. Whilst predominantly hydrophobic, this small pocket contains a serine.67 Dehydration is proposed to occur when SAM binds with the positive charge on the sulphur possibly assisting with stabilisation of the naked fluoride. The requirement for the fluoride ion to bind first in order for a productive complex to be formed, is argued based on observed substrate inhibition by SAM. Within the crystal structure, SAM may be seen bound with its ribose ring forced",

The halide anion is positioned collinearly with the SAM C\u2013S bond, thus promoting an SN2 backside attack (Scheme 4). 67 When the enzyme is crystallised in the presence of both SAM and fluoride, the products L-methionine and 50-fluoro-50-deoxyadenosine (50-FDA) with the ribose ring in the relaxed conformation may be observed. The fluorinase has a strong preference for fluoride, but can incorporate chloride to a low level.68 SalL, from Salinispora tropica bacterium has 54% sequence similarity to the fluorinase, and in the halide binding pocket, a glycine residue resides in place of a serine. This enzyme shows a strong preference for chlorination and, whilst capable of utilising bromide and iodide, it cannot process fluoride.64 Notable uses of the fluorinase include exploration of its application to 18F incorporation for positron emission tomo-graphy (PET),69 and it\u2019s the utilisation of the fluorinase in parallel with a polyketide synthase to enable synthetic biological access to simple fluorinated polyketides.70 1.4 Biocatalytic potential. The halogenases offer great potential for use as biocatalysts. To realise the application of these important enzymes, the regio-control, -selectivity and reaction rate afforded by the different classes of enzymes is important to consider. The reported exploration of kinetics for the halogenases in the literature is both sparse and varied, and can be challenging to compare due to the different ways in which the data are obtained. We compile a representative overview of the kinetic analyses available for different families of halogenases for a brief comparison between families (Table 1), as well as a glossary of the halogenases that have been structurally characterised so far (Table 2). Haloperoxidases, such as CPO, may be seen to have high turn-over numbers",
        "(Kcat 33 None 1 minNone1), yet such catalysts that may be utilised to halogenate a broad series of substrates (see Section 2) lack regio-control. Conversely, the NHFeHals also have a high turn-over number, mediate a highly regio-selective reaction, but the nat-ural reaction that its catalyses is much slower than CPO (Kcat/Km 0.0525 vs. 1.22 mMNone1 minNone1, Table 1).",
        "2. Natural and unnatural aromatic substrate scope for biocatalytic halogenation 2.1 Indolic substrates 2.1.1 Early stage halogenation in biosynthetic pathways. Indoles are commonly utilised motifs in medicine and agro-chemistry, and new tools that enable their chemical diversifica-tion are desirable. There are a series of FDHs that allow for this diversification, via halogenation. Many FDHs mediating the regiospecific halogenation of the indole moiety of tryptophan have been found so far. Most of these enzymes have been found to be involved in the early stages of bioactive natural product synthesis. Such enzymes include PrnA and RebH, tryptophan 7-halogenases, from the first step of the biosynthesis of the antibiotic pyrrolnitrin 24 and the indolocarbazole anticancer agent rebeccamycin 36, respectively.35,43 Tryptophan 6-halogenases include ThdH (alternatively known as ThaI) from the first step of thienodolin 25 biosynthesis, a plant growth promoting compound,71 SttH identified in silico adjacent to an NRPS cluster,72 SatH from Streptomyces albus,73 BorH, a ther-mophilic halogenase from borregomycin 33\u201335 biosynthesis,74 and AfnX responsible for generating the 6-chlorotryptophan precursor of alboflavusin A 26. Alboflavusin is an analogue of the dimeric non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) anti-tumor agent and apoptosis inducing agents, himastatin and chloptosin.75 Though less common so far, 5-chlorotryptophans may also be seen as motifs in natural products. Examples include the antibiotic pyrroindomycin B 27; the first step in the biosynth-esis of this compound is the generation of 5-chlorotryptophan by PyrH.76 Sequence analysis of Xenorhabdus szentirmaii revealed a further flavin dependent tryptophan 5-halogenase XszenFHal. Though the natural function of this halogenase remains unknown, it was demonstrated to be capable of",

The modification of a large phenylalanine residue in the active site to a smaller alanine allowed for a different binding orientation of tryptophan, leading to halogenation at the 5 position, though it must be noted that halogenation at the 7 position still dominated (2 : 1 ratio of 7-/5-bromination).78 Despite useful changes in selectivity being rare, there are a number of further successes.42,79 Positioning of the lysine residue over the substrate was thought to be critical to site of halogenation. Various studies toward gaining deeper understanding of subtle factors beyond the positioning of the lysine residue in the active site have been carried out, including structural comparison of PyrH, SttH and PrnA, and, specifically, a loop proximal to the active site, informing the design of mutants with modified regiochemistries.80 Modifications to ThaI, to promote chlorination at the 7 position, rather than the 6 position have also been reported.81 Biosynthesis of 4-chlorotryptophan remains a mystery.

The keramamides 30116 and linked family of jaspamides, chondra-mides 28 are two exceptions, with CmdE implicated in the generation of 2-chlorotryptophan,117 though for this enzyme, no activity with free tryptophan can be shown. It is not clear as to whether lack of observation of production of this species by CmdE is due to the enzyme requiring a different substrate or due to the instability of the product. 2-Chlorotryptophans are very unstable and both the free amine and carboxy groups might be considered to promote dechlorination. Tryptophan halogenases capable of halogenating substi-tuted tryptophans are also known.

This biosynthetic logic has been utilised to enable the generation of combinatorial libraries of known and novel compounds in which halogenation and glycosylation patterns are modulated.124 Similar to these compounds are the bisindole alkaloids indimicins and related spiroindimicins 38\u201340 (Fig. 4).125 The tryptophan halogenases have been previously thought to possess only modest innate substrate flexibility. RebH is capable of processing tryptolines, whilst KrmI will halogenate unsubstituted indoles and fluoro-tryptophan.42,119 The tryptophan halogenases continue to be subject to extensive rational reengineering and directed evolution due to their potential as tools for biocatalysis.

NapH1 is particularly notable, this versatile enzyme acts upon geranylated tetrahydroxynapthalene (THN) derivative, stereose-lectively hydroxylating it whilst mediating regioselective chlorination (Scheme 5). NapT8 and NapH3 operate succes-sively to catalyse prenylation and then an a-hydroxy ketone rearrangement. NapH1 then operates once more to halogenate the newly introduced prenyl unit. The reaction is most likely to proceed via a halonium species, which is then opened by the hydroxyl that NapH1 previously introduced, thereby enabling enantioselective cyclisation. In a similar manner, NapH4 mediates halogenation of the geranyl unit, again most likely proceeding via the halonium species, and promoting intra-molecular cyclisation.152 The complex cyclic scaffolds of the merochlorins 77, 78 are formed using similar chemical logic. Enzymatic total syntheses of napyradiomycin B1 76 has been enabled in 18% yield.153",
        "2.2.4 Substrate scope: phenols. Smaller, freestanding, non-native phenolic substrates have been demonstrated to be processed by variant A FDHs and HPOs (Fig. 8), revealing these enzymes to be useful biocatalysts. The employment of the HPOs, in this context, whilst enabling halogenation of sterically bulky substrates, results in mixtures of regioisomers and poly-halogenated compounds. This is a direct result of most HPOs releasing free hypohalous acid; in this context, the enzyme has little control over the regiochemistry of the transformation, and it is simply the most electron-rich region(s) of the substrate that are halogenated. In contrast, the FDHs usually accept much smaller substrates but are generally highly regioselective. PltM has been shown capable of mono 117 or di-halogenation 118 of phloroglucinol (Fig. 8J), as well as being able to accept resveratrol as a substrate.51 Wild type RebH, GsfI, and ThaI have been shown capable of processing a broad range of non-natural substrates containing phenolic moieties.154 Exceptions may be seen with RadH/Rdc2 and VirX1, FDHs with much more open and accessible active sites, capable of regioselectively monohalogenating much larger phenolic substrates.47,143,144 2.3 Pyrrolic substrates. Substituted pyrroles are also widely used in medicine and agrochemistry. In nature, halogenases may be found that are capable of mono-or poly-halogenating pyrroles. Halopyrrole containing natural products include pyrrolnitrin 24,34 pentachloropseudilin 71,151 chlorizidine A 131,162 hormaomycin 132,163 pyoluteorin 133164 and pyrrolo-mycins 134\u2013137165 (Scheme 6). PrnC, a variant A FDH, chlorinates the pyrrole of 128 in the final step of pyrrolnitrin 24 biosynthesis.34 Here, the pyrrole is generated through the cleavage and rearrangement of 7-chlorotryptophan 127 (Scheme 6). HalB, which shares 45% sequence identity with PrnC, is implicated in halogenating the pyrrole of pentachloro-pseudalin 71.151 For chlorizidine a 131, hormaomycin 132, marinopyrrole 138,166 the pyrrole is formed by oxidation of a proline uploaded onto an acyl carrier protein (ACP), the ACP tethered pyrrole is then halogenated. Bmp2 is one such variant B flavin-dependent pyrrole halogenase, mediating the",
        "intriguing tetrabromination of the PCP-bound pyrrole ring, with the introduction of the fourth bromide, to C1, apparently triggering thioesterase mediated release and decarboxylation to restore aromaticity.48 Curiously, the biosynthetically-related halogenase, Bmp5, employs a chemically similar strategy of decarboxylative bromination in the conversion of p-hydroxy-benzoic acid to 2,4-dibromophenol (see Section 1.1.2). Mpy16 from marinopyrrole 138 biosynthesis is structurally similar to Bmp2, yet stops at dihalogenation,166 as do Clz5162 and PltA164 in chlorazidine A 131 and pyoluteorin 133 biosynthesis, respec-tively. Pyr29 is also postulated to di-halogenate an ACP tethered pyrrole 130 in the biosynthesis of the pyrrolomycins,165 whilst HrmQ from hormaomycin 132 biosynthesis mediates monohalogenation.163 Structure-guided mutagenesis has been performed on wild-type Bmp2 to generate a Bmp2 triple mutant (Bmp2-TM) which proceeds no further than dibromination.48 2.4 Aromatic substrate scope beyond indole, phenol and pyrrole. Though the vast majority of natural substrates for the FDHs and haloperoxidases studied so far are indolic, phenolic or pyrrolic in nature, they have been effectively employed in installing halogens into other substrate classes. Generally, once again, the FDHs are seen to confer greater regio-and substrate specificity than the HPOs that generate and release free HOX. Initial reports of wild-type flavin-dependent halogenases had been indicative of a fairly modest and narrow substrate scope. However, RebH, PrnA, PyrH, and SttH have been shown capable of processing a series of anilines including kyuneride 171, anthranilamide to give 172 and, to a lesser extent, anthranilic acid to give 174 (Fig. 9C\u2013F).79,80 These studies also gave insight into factors governing regiospecificity. With PyrH, regiospecific para-chlorination 171 of kynurenine was observed whereas PrnA mediated the formation of the ortho-chlorinated product 166 exclusively, a product that is more chemically challenging to access. PyrH could also be used to achieve the regiospecific para-chlorination 172 of anthranilamide, whereas use of PrnA resulted in a 86% : 14% para : ortho mixture. Mutations could be effectively employed to modulate ortho:para selectivities and improve yields for these unnatural substrates.79 Chlorination of naphthalen-2-amine to give 165 by RebH ortho to \u2013NH2 is achieved in a high yield of 93%.126 The halogenation of sterically bulky substrates can be enabled using haloperoxidases. As there is generally no sub-strate binding site, and free HOX is released, the substrates that can be halogenated using these systems are not limited by size. However, as is usually expected for an HPO that releases HOX, series of regioisomers, as well as mono, di, and tri halogenated compounds result (Fig. 9G).169 For example, heme iron-dependent chloroperoxidase (CPO) from C. fumago has been used to give chlorinated analogues of naphthalene 182, anthracene 183 and pyrenes 185 and 186. A vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase from the marine algae Ascophyl-lum nodosum has also been employed mono and dibromination 4,6,8-trimethylazulene 179 (Fig. 9G), though the instability of the resultant product hindered purification.168 To achieve regioselective electrophilic halogenation, generally FDHs are needed, however, historically these have shown fairly",

Good conversions of a wide range of unnatural substrates are possible with this unusual enzyme from a virus.47 Similar infomatics-led approaches have been utilised by the Sewald and Lewis groups, further demonstrating that natural FDHs do exist with broader substrate scope.170 2.5 Aliphatic substrate scope for biocatalytic halogenation.

AdeV was shown to have 15% similarity to WelO5. Gene knockout experiments confirmed its role in adechlorin biosynthesis. AdeV acts in the early stages of biosynthesis on free nucleoside 20-deoxyadenosine-50-monophosphate (20-dAMP) 258 to generate 20-Cl-20-dAMP. In vitro assays revealed that 20-deoxyadenosine (20-dA), identical to 20-dAMP apart from the 50-phosphate moiety, was not accepted as a substrate, indicating that the presence of this phosphate is essential for substrate binding and halogenation activity. Consistent with this logic, two other phosphorylated nucleosides 20,30-dideoxyadenosine monophosphate 261 and 20deoxyinosine-50-monophosphate (20-dIMP) 263, were accepted by AdeV and converted to their chlorinated counterparts indicating a level of enzyme promiscuity. However, the natural substrate 20-dAMP showed the highest levels of conversion. Several plant species are known to generate halogenated metabolites. The toxin fluoroacetate is produced in many plants including Camellia sinensis (from which tea is generated). Fatty acid derivatives of fluoroacetate such as o-fluorooleic acid accumulating in the seeds of Dichapetalum toxicarium.181 An exciting new NHFe halogenase DAH that performs the stereo-selective late stage chlorination of the complex alkaloid dechlor-oacutimine 265, (Scheme 10C) produced by menispermaceae plants, has been found and its activity demonstrated in vitro. This represents the very first NHFeHal found in plants.181 Phylogenetic analysis indicates that DAH, which has a variant in Menispermaceae canadense (McDAH) and Sinomenium acutum (SaDAH), evolved independently from the previously discussed bacterial NHFeHAls, potentially being an example of parallel evolution in halogenated natural product metabolism. In vitro assays against a wide range of alkaloids indicated that DAH was highly selective towards its natural substrate, with no other small molecules being accepted for halogenation. As with some other halogenases, DAH was shown to accept azide anions as well as halides, and convert (None)-dechloroacutumine to 11-azido-dechloroacutumine. Beyond the NHFe halogenases, alkyl halides can be generated by a series of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases. An elegant cyclisation cascade is initiated by the selective bromination of a single alkene within a terpenoid; the resultant bromonium undergoes ring opening affording the alkyl bromide. For example, the vanadium bromoperoxidase from C. officinalis brominates the terpenoid precursor (E)-(+)nerolidol 267, yielding cyclised snyderols 268-230.184 For b-and g-snyderol, a single diastereo-isomer is produced. This provides an exciting biocatalytic oppor-tunity as synthetic methods have succeeded only in forming a mixture of two diastereoisomers of each product (Scheme 11). In a similar manner, chlorination, mediated by haloperoxidases, may be seen to generate chloronium species, initiating cyclisation cascades. Installation of chlorine onto the aliphatic moiety of SF2415B1 by NapH1 allows cyclisation of the structure to afford a cyclic ether, offering potential for synthesis of napyradiomycins 76 (Scheme 5) with cytotoxic and antibacterial properties.155 Notably, a small number of FDHs process aliphatic compounds.

Intriguingly, an FDH from a fungus, AoiQ, has been demonstrated to regioselectively chlorinate an unactivated terminal sp3 carbon of a freestanding molecule 271, in the biosynthesis of orthosporin (Scheme 12). So far, AoiQ is unique amongst other flavin-dependent halogenases in its ability to perform this task. Although the mechanism for this reaction is unknown, it has been postulated by Hertweck and coworkers that, though it is a FDH, it may proceed via a radical reaction.186 Notably, like KrmI, it is one of the few fused halogenases to be explored. In the case of AoiQ, it contains a functional O-methylation domain. The mystery as to how it operates remains to be revealed.",

The broad range of halogenated structures that have been noted, over 5000 to date,13 together with the variety of organisms from which they are produced, indicates that many diverse halogenases remain to be discovered. In silico discovery approaches have been utilised to mine for various halogenases within uncurated genomic deposits, leading to the discovery of more substrate flexible halogenases from diverse sources including viruses.47,170 Discovery of novel halogenases remains at the forefront of biocatalytic halogenation research. For effective biocatalysis, good amounts of soluble protein are required. The Lewis group have effectively improved heterologous production of RebF through including a cleavable maltose binding protein (MBP) tag, to enhance solubility of the enzyme, and co-expressing both the halogenase and the concomitant reductase, RebF with the chaperonins GroEL/ES, in addition to developing a cofactor recycling system.126 Advances on FADH2 regeneration have recently been achieved by replacing NADH with synthetic mimics.191 A photocatalytic approach has been successfully applied to the VHPOs. The Gulder group cleverly demonstrated that by illuminating their biocatalytic system with 455 nm light, and including sacrificial electron donors, cofactor recycling could be addressed, and a ready supply of reduced cofactor afforded in a relatively inexpensive manner.192,193 An approach that has made a significant difference to the utilisation of FDHs is the application of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA). FDHs generally have poor stability, impacting their catalytic longevity and utility in scaled up reactions. The robust nature and solvent tolerance of Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals was first reported in the early 1990s, but the technique required the enzymes of interest to first be crystalised.194 The application of CLEA was first demonstrated for PenAcylase, an aminoacylase utilised in the generation of ampicillin, where CLEA were generated from precipitating, rather than crystallising, the enzyme prior to cross-linking.195 By using a CombiCLEAS approach of 1 g of L-tryptophan to 1.8 g of L-7-Br-tryptophan could be achieved with complete conversion within an 8 days period.130 To achieve this, the lysate from Escherichia coli (E. coli) (6 L), that had been grown with a RebH expression vector, was combined with PrnF, the flavin reductase from Pseudomonas fluorescens, and an alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus sp., that had been precipitated with ammonium sulfate, was then cross-linked with 0.5%/wt glutaraldehyde to form the CombiCLEAS.",

This concept, first reported in 2010, with the tryptophan halogenase PrnA being utilised to give access to a new to nature haloindolic natural product, which was subsequently functionalised through Suzuki\u2013Miyaura cross-coupling,196 has been gaining momentum. This section comprehensively reviews the current state-of-the-art and reflects on technologies enabling the hyphenation. 4.1 Aqueous compatible cross-coupling methodologies. Palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions play a central role in organic chemistry. Their utility in the formation of C\u2013C and carbon\u2013heteroatom bonds under mild conditions with a wide range of organic halide and nucleophilic reagents, has led to them being one of the most utilised series of reactions in the pharmaceutical industry.197 As with almost all enzymes, the halogenases require an aqueous environment for effective operation. To effectively couple enzymatic halogenation with synthetic diversification, aqueous compatible reaction conditions are generally required. Palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions have largely utilized traditional organic solvents. Standard conditions for these coupling methodologies typically use a mixed organic/aqueous base solvent system, hence the development of water solubilising ligands have been highly enabling. The first example of a water-soluble palladium catalyst for cross-coupling reactions being reported by Casalnuovo,198 and significant effort has been devoted to the development of hydro-philic palladium/ligand complexes for aqueous-phase catalysis since this seminal work, as well as active hydrophobic catalysts and ligand-free species based on palladium nanoparticles.199\u2013203 The development of mild cross coupling conditions for the modulation of challenging and or functionally sensitive com-pounds is advancing, enabling the diversification and tuning of small molecules, natural products and biomolecules including nucleic acids and peptides. To this end, aqueous compatible and water soluble ligands such as TPPTS 274,199 and the sterically demanding and electron-rich TXPTS 275,199 sSPhos 276,204 SXPhos 277204 and disodium 2-aminopyrimidine-4,6-diol 278205\u2013207 have proved valuable (Fig. 10).

        "2021to facilitate tandem halogenation and cross-coupling strategies in living systems.208 Specifically, with the goal of enabling C\u2013H activation through enzymatic halogenation and chemical cross-coupling, our team has developed series of aqueous cross-coupling procedures, enabling the cross-coupling to be compatible with molecules decorated with sensitive functional groups, as well as with enzymes and even in live cell environments. We have initiated our development of these catalytic conditions by focussing on challenging free and unprotected halotrypto-phans. Our choice has been directed by three factors: \u2013 The availability of a well-characterised series of tryptophan halogenases that may be utilised in standalone format in conjunction with a biosynthetic pathway to access halotrypto-phans and synchronously new-to-nature halotryptophan containing natural products; \u2013 The utility of tryptophan as a fluorescence tag and a moiety that governs protein folding, and the attraction to being able to tune these properties; \u2013 And the challenge that free tryptophan confers, rendering it a suitably stimulating test bed. We reasoned that by developing conditions that were suitable to address the cross-coupling of free halotryptophan, a small molecule with the propensity to coordinate to the catalyst and render it inactive, such conditions could be readily applied to other more tractable moieties. To this end, we developed a range of aqueous conditions enabling the Suzuki\u2013Miyaura,209 Heck,210 Sonogashira,211 keto-arylation212 and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig213 diversification of free unprotected tryptophan, peptides, and natural products (Scheme 13). The development of mild aqueous chemistries has facilitated chemo-enzymatic and GenoChemetic approaches. Site selective C\u2013H activation is enabled by a halogenase and synthetic diversi-fication carried out, in some cases synchronously, through aqueous compatible Pd mediated catalysis. More reactive aryl iodides and bromides can be coupled under much milder conditions than their less activated chloro counterparts. 4.2 Chemo-enzymatic approaches. Hyphenation of enzymatic halogenation and synthetic derivatisation has been enabled by steering, where possible, to enzymatic bromination (or even iodina-tion) over enzymatic chlorination, employing combinations of stabilised or partitioned enzymes, and use of mild and aqueous cross-coupling methodologies. There is burgeoning interest in employing such strategies as powerful methods for late-stage diversification on ever more complex molecules. The approach is also utilised to enable a fast fluorescence assay for enzyme screening and for directed evolution. A few enzymes, such as RadH have been shown capable of halogenating 7-hydroxycoumarin. An enhancement in fluorescence occurs when 7-hydroxycoumarin (lmax 325 nm) is converted to 8-chloro-7-hydroxycoumarin (lex 386 nm/lem 456 nm). 144 In most halogenation reactions, a clear change in fluorescence is not always observable, and cross-coupling chemistry has been employed to provide a fluorescence readout that may be used to assay halogenase activity. Sewald reported the utilisation of tryptophan 5-, 6-and 7-halogenases PyrH, ThaI, and RebH for bromination of L-tryptophan",
        "substrate.214,215 The team then employed aqueous cross-coupling conditions. To achieve cross-coupling of the bromo-tryptophan product within the crude lysate, the Pd-catalyst loading was further increased to 50 mol%. By reaction with the boronic acid of aniline, the products (30-aminophenyl)-tryptophans were reported to have a lex 300 nm/lem 430 nm (Scheme 14B). This technology was utilised for microtitre plate screening enabling rapid analysis of ThaI mutants that had been generated by error-prone PCR.215 The Sewald team also cleverly employed CLEA technology (see Section 3) to enable bromination of tryptophan by these same halogenases PyrH, ThaI, and RebH. Not only did the utilisation of enzyme aggregates afford stabilisation, but it also provided an opportunity for readily filtering off the enzymes ahead of Suzuki\u2013 Miyaura diversification of the resultant halotryptophans. By utilis-ing a three-step approach, organic solvents required for solubilisa-tion of several of the substrates could be used, with Boc protection being carried out in a final step, thereby easing purification.214 In a similar manner, the Sewald group developed a three-step one pot reaction utilising RebH and Mizoroki\u2013Heck chemistry for the further diversification of tryptophans. Again, by using their combi-CLEA system in a stepwise manner (Scheme 14D), the harsher reaction conditions required for Heck diversification could be utilised and enabled the generation of C-7 substituted styryl-tryptophan with a lem of 485 nm (lex 360 nm), and Stokes shift of 7159 cmNone1.216 This larger Stokes\u2019 shift renders this technology potentially very useful for molecule tagging and enzyme assay, as well as valuable for molecule diversification. Even when stabilised as CLEA, enzymes and Pd catalysts can have poor compatibility. To achieve a synchronous one-pot enzymatic halogenation and chemical cross-coupling, and to avoid the additional filtration step, Micklefield and co-workers elegantly partitioned CLEA stabilised PyrH, RebH, RadH and SttH from the Pd catalyst through use of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane. Whilst the brominated enzymatic product could pass through the PMDS, it was reported to be impervious to the enzymes and cofactors. The cross-coupled product, once formed, remained in the chemo-catalytic chamber (Scheme 14G).218 Though the majority of chemo-enzymatic approaches published so far have focussed on tryptophans and other indolic systems, this is predominantly a reflection of the most extensively studied FDHs. Through substrate walking method-ology, Jared Lewis and co-workers have impressively evolved RebH to work on substrates that are chemically distinct from its natural tryptophan substrate. Utilisation of evolved halo-genases enabled bromination of a diverse series of substrates including tryptolines, sterically bulky substituted anilines as well as carvediol and pindolol, two clinically utilised beta-blockers. Conditions to enable Suzuki\u2013Miyaura, Buchwald\u2013 Hartwig amination and alkoxylation were developed and applied mostly to the chlorinated and brominated intermediates as a component of a crude extract, resulting in high yields of the respective products 284\u2013289 (Scheme 13D\u2013F).189 With the discovery of more substrate diverse halogenases, engineering of known halogenases, enzyme stabilisation and partitioning strategies and the development of milder reaction conditions,",

        "2021have been successfully used in various chemoenzymatic halo-cyclization reactions,219,220 and recently this has been merged with homogenous metal catalysis for further diversification. Deska and coworkers enabled the one-pot combination of allenol halocylization using CPO from Caldariomyces fumago and glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (GOx) with SPhos catalysed Suzuki\u2013Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling to diversify a range of dihydrofurans. Excitingly, a nanobiohybrid was also generated using GOx as a support for palladium nanoparticles, which led to good yields of stepwise halocycliza-tion and Suzuki coupling.221 4.3 GenoChemetic approaches. Whilst in an enzymatic or whole cell biotransformation where the enzymes or cells are exogenously supplemented with substrates, in a GenoChemetic approach, the substrate and tagged intermediates are fully biosynthesised by an engineered organism. GenoChemetic processes provide an expeditious route to generating series of analogues of natural products. Semi-synthesis, though a useful tool, is limited by the innate functional groups naturally present within the molecule. GenoChemetics addresses this. It involves the introduction of a gene to complement a biosyn-thetic pathway, such that a chemically reactive and orthogonal handle is introduced into the natural product. This handle enables synthetic diversification of the natural product. There are so far three reports of the utilisation of halogenases within GenoChemetic systems. In each of these systems, tryptophan halogenases have been employed, with RebH, PyrH, and PrnA being installed into either pathway engineered or wild-type strains enabling the production of chlorinated or brominated analogues of the complex natural product scaffolds. The halogenated metabolites have been subjected to cross-coupling chemistries. In the first example, the tryptophan halogenase PrnA was installed, through use of an integrative vector, into the genome of Streptomyces coeruleorubidis. It was demonstrated that there was no need to introduce PrnA\u2019s concomitant flavin reductase, as the organism\u2019s own reductases sufficed. A chlorinated analogue of pacidamycin, a uridyl peptide antibiotic, was produces at a titre of B1 mg LNone1. In spite of bearing series of sensitive functional groups, this metabolite could be readily cross-coupled using the moderately mild Suzuki-Miyaura conditions that were developed. The cross-coupling was carried out both on the purified material and on material as a component of a crude extract (Scheme 15). The latter was preferable, as the more lipophilic product that resulted was much more readily amenable to purification.217 The generation of brominated analogues would, of course, facilitate cross-coupling under even milder conditions. However, Strepto-myces coeruleorubidis was found to be sensitive to bromide salts, and the brominated analogue cannot readily be accessed through use of this strain. Streptomyces coelicolor showed good tolerance to bromide salts in a screen of series of potential heterologous expression hosts, and so the pacidamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, identified previously, was ported into this strain conferring it with the ability to produce pacidamycins. The gene encoding the halogenase PrnA was engineered into the strain and ability to produce bromo-pacidamycin was confirmed.",
        "In order to enable bromometabolite production and cross-coupling synchronously, mild cross-coupling reactions that enabled derivatisation of 7-Br-pacidamycin D 305 in the presence of the living culture were carried out. In a similar manner, E. coli was engineered with the ability to make bromo-tryptophan and its cross-coupling to 306 affected in the living fermentative culture.222 A similar system was designed in hairy root cultures of Catharanthus roseus in which they were engi-neered to include RebH, PyrH and their concomitant reductases. This led to the production of a range of chlorinated and brominated analogues of the plant\u2019s monoterpene indole alkaloid natural products 299\u2013301, which were successfully extracted and coupled in non-aqueous Suzuki\u2013Miyaura couplings, either as crude extracts or purified compounds (Scheme 15A).223,224",
        "Conclusions Though enzyme mediated halogenation was initially considered to be nothing more than an artefact or a rare event, today over 30 enzymes capable of mediating such chemistry have been structurally and biochemically characterised (Table 2), and an even greater number subject to in vitro and in vivo investigation. Halogenated compounds play a major role in the construction of molecules via cross-coupling methodologies, as well as making up a large percentage of medicinally and agrochemically relevant molecules. In a world that seeks more selective, greener and more sustainable solutions to molecule manufacture, halo-genases hold an opportunity. They also offer potential for the vectorisation of fragments for SAR. Whilst the kinetic analyses of the halogenases is rather potted, drawing this data together is useful in identifying potential halogenases for development and use in biotransformations. Whilst the HPOs are capable of mediating halogenation of large and sterically demanding sub-strates, as most neither bind the substrate nor the electrophilic species, such systems generally lack regiocontrol. A few intriguing departures from this trend have been identified from marine systems, indicating that there is much more to learn about these enzymes, their operation and evolution. New variant A FDHs with reasonable catalytic efficiency and broad substrate scopes have been revealed in the last two years, enabling regioselective chlorination, bromination and even iodination on sterically and electronically demanding aromatic systems, even prior to rational redesign or evolution. Excitingly, in recent years the range of variant A NHFeHals that enable the controlled halogenation, including stereoselective halogenation, have been identified; clearly, there are many more such systems awaiting discovery. Inspired by such systems, it may be possible to generate artificial architectures that, perhaps via haloamines, position and deliver electrophilic halogenating agents to substrates held in the required position to affect desired regiochemistries. Halogenation introduces a chemically reactive, chemically orthogonal moiety into a compound. This single atom modification, that can be genetically/enzymatically installed has the potential to act as a superior tag to azide or alkyne",
