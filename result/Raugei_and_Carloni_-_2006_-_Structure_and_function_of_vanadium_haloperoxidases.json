The investigation of different protonation states indicates that the enzyme likely consists of an anionic H2VO4-vanadate moiety where one hydroxo group is in axial position. The calculations suggest that the hydrogen peroxide binding may not involve an initial protonation of the vanadate cofactor. A low free energy reactive path is found where the hydrogen peroxide directly attacks the axial hydroxo group, resulting in the formation of an hydrogen peroxide intermediate. This intermediate is promptly protonated to yield a peroxo species. The free energy barrier for the formation of the peroxo species does not depend significantly upon the protonation state of the cofactor. The most likely protonation states of the peroxo cofactor are neutral forms HVO2(O2) with a hydroxo group either H-bonded to Ser402 or coordinated to Arg360. The peroxo cofactor is also coordinated to an axial water molecule, which could be important for the stability of the peroxovanadate/His496 adduct. Our calculations strongly suggest that the halide oxidation may take place with the preliminary formation of a peroxovanadate/halogen adduct. Subsequently, the halogen reacts with the peroxo moiety yielding a hypohalogen vanadate. The most reactive protonation state of peroxovanadate is the neutral HVO2(O2) with the hydroxo group H-bonded to Ser402. The important role of Lys353 in determining the catalytic activity is also confirmed. 1. Introduction Since the discovery of vanadium redox enzymes about 2 decades ago, there has been an increasing interest in the biological, pharmacological, and industrial applications of vanadium.1-6 Two classes of vanadium-based enzymes have so far been identified: vanadium-nitrogenases and vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases. The vanadium-nitrogenases7 acti-vate and reduces several substrates such as molecular nitrogen.8 Vanadium-haloperoxidases (VHPOs) contain vanadium(V) as vanadate or related ions and catalyze the two-electron oxidation of a halide ion, X-, to the hypohalous acids, HXO:4 HXO can further react with a wide range of activated C-H bonds under acidic conditions, generating diverse halogenated natural products, in particular in the marine biosphere.2,9 The names of VHPOs are assigned on the basis of the most electronegative halide they can oxides. Thus, a vanadium chloroperoxidase is able to oxide Cl-, Br-, and I-. Understanding the reaction mechanism of these proteins may help the design of biomimetic vanadium complexes, which have attracted considerable attention as putative oxidation and oxo transfer catalysts.4,6,10-16 Peroxovanadium complexes represent good functional models of the VHPO and have been shown to epoxidize alkenes,17 hydroxylate hydrocarbons,18 and oxidize many organic compounds,14,19 and they can perform efficient enantioselective sulfoxidations.20,21 Three vanadate-dependent peroxidases have been structurally characterized so far: from brown algae (Ascophyllum no-dosum),22 from red algae (Corallina officinalis),23 and from fungi (CurVularia inaequalis).24,25 For the latter, the X-ray structure of the adduct with the peroxo intermediate has also been solved.24 These enzymes possess a high degree of amino acid sequence homology in the active site cavity. These structures have revealed that the vanadate moiety is bound to the NNone of an imidazolyl ring of a proximal histidine residue, and it is further hydrogen-bonded to a distal histidine and water mol-ecules, giving rise to an trigonal-bipyramidal geometry (Figure 1a). Although a large number of organic compounds are known to be halogenated by haloperoxidases, a thorough understanding of the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood. Upon coordination of the peroxo group, it is clear that a structural rearrangement to a tetragonal pyramid takes place25 (Figure 1b). On the basis of a variety of experimental4,6,14,15,24-32 and theoretical12,33-37 studies, the following scenarios for the protonation state at the active site and reaction mechanisms have been proposed. (i) The X-ray structure of the apo form of V-ClPO is identical to the native structure, suggesting that the protein scaffold is rigid and provides a preformed cofactor binding site.26 (ii) The oxidation state of the vanadium (+V) does not change during catalysis, and therefore, the metal acts as a strong Lewis acid with respect to the actual oxidant hydrogen peroxide.3 (iii) Most likely, the axial oxygen of the vanadate-histidine complex is protonated in C. officinalis at pH ) 8.24 It is however unclear whether other oxygens of the vanadate moiety are protonated. There are three possibly positively charged groups at the active site directly coordinated to the cofactor: two guanidiniums (from Arg360 and Arg490, \u2020 Part of the special issue \u201cMichael L.

The cofactor also forms a H-bond with a serine (Ser402) and with the protein backbone peptidic N-H group (Gly403 and Arg490, Figure 1a). Recent computational studies by Pecoraro and co-workers35 of the protonation state of gas-phase models of the native VHPO indicate that the vanadate cofactor is likely in an anionic H2VO4-form that along with the charges of the enzyme pocket creates a cationic (or neutral) active site. (iv) It is supposed that the hydrogen bond between the apical cofactor OaH group and His404 makes that hydroxy unit more nucleo-philic.25 Hence, when a hydrogen peroxide molecule approaches the active site, the apical vanadate OH-is protonated and HOO-is released. The weakly bound water molecule then dissociates from the cofactor and a peroxide intermediate is generated after the formation of a second water molecule. (v) The binding site of halides or organic sulfides is not clear even thought there are evidences of a nucleophilic site opposite to the peroxo ligand.27 It has also been proposed that the first steps of halogen oxidation may involve the protonation of the peroxo group.14,15 Further computational investigations on models of the peroxo-vanadium cofactor36 suggest that the protonation state of Lys353 plays a fundamental role in activating the peroxo moiety for the oxo-transfer. All of the theoretical studies12,33-37 on VHPO performed so far are based on simple models of the active site in vacuo. Although they provide an important piece of information, it has been proposed, however, that the role of the protein environment via supramolecular interactions28 could be crucial in determining the stability of the active site. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the mechanism of formation of the peroxo intermediate and the early stages of halogen oxidation at finite temperature is still lacking. Herein we focused on vanadium chloroperoxidase form C. inaequalis. We employed ab initio (Car-Parrinello)-molecular mechanics (CP/MM) simulations38-40 (section 2) to clarify the structure of the vanadate cofactor and the reactivity vs hydrogen peroxide and bromide anion. The study was performed taking fully into account the field of the entire protein, solvent and counterions. We found that at physiological conditions the vanadate moiety is likely present as dioxovanadium(V), VO2+ coordinated to two hydroxyl anions, giving formally rise to a H2VO4-anion (section 3.1). In addition, the peroxovanadate species, which likely proceeds through a hydrogen peroxide intermediate (section 3.2), is in a monoprotonated neutral state with a water molecule coordinated in the axial position (section 3.3). The peroxo cofactor forms an adduct with the halogen, which in turn readily reacts yielding an hypohalogen vanadate species (section 3.4). 2. Computational Details The study was carried out in two distinct stages. In the first stage, classical molecular dynamics (section 2.1) was used to equilibrate the vanadium haloperoxidase for C. inaequalis24 in aqueous solution. Then, hybrid QM/MM simulations (section 2.2) were performed to determine the protonation state of the active site in order to study the binding of hydrogen peroxide and, subsequently, of the bromide anion (see section 2.3). 2.1. Classical Molecular Dynamics. The water solvated crystal structure of the resting state of the enzyme24 (protein data bank, pdb,41 entry: 1IDQ) and of the peroxo form24 (pdb entry: 1IDU) were relaxed in aqueous solution using classical molecular dynamics. If not otherwise stated, asparates and glutammates were taken in the anionic form, whereas lysines and arginines were considered to be positively charged. His404 was considered to be either charged or neutral (protonated at N\u03b4). Several protomers differing for number and location of the protons were considered (see model a to model p, Figures 2 and 7). The systems were enclosed in a orthorhombic cell and solvated by about 20 000 water molecules with additional Na+ counterions to ensure neutrality. The Amber42 force field was used for the protein, water, and counterions. Atom-atom parameters for vanadate and peroxo-vanadate cofactors were taken according to ref 43, whereas atomic point charges were calculated using the RESP scheme adopted in Amber for the imidazole/vanadate and imidazole/ peroxo cofactor complexes. Charges for different protonation states were calculated. During these simulations both the cofactor and His496 were constrained to the crystallographic positions. The electrostatic interactions were treated using a particle mesh Ewald summation. For each protonation state studied, equilibration was achieved by a 500 ps restrained molecular dynamics in which a harmonic potential of 20 kcal mol-1\u00c5-2 was applied to each atom. During the simulations the restraining potential was gradually switched off, thus allowing the protein structure to slowly adjust to the presence of the solvent and counterions. At the same time, the temperature was raised from 0 to 300 K using a stochastic rescaling of the atomic velocities and allowing the cell to readjust its volume. Next, the system was equilibrated for a further 0.8-1.0 ns, depending on the protonation state of the catalytic pocket, controlling the temperature with a stochastic (Berendsen) Figure 1. Crystal structure of the (a) native and the (b) peroxide form of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase from fungus C. inaequalis.25 thermostat of frequency 1 ps-1. Finally, in all of the simulations the density fluctuations were controlled by a stochastic (Ber-endsen) barostat of frequency 1 ps-1. 2.2. Hybrid Car)Parrinello/Molecular Mechanics Simu-lations. The final MD structures were partitioned into two parts.44 The active site (the cofactor and His496, His404, Arg360, Arg490, Lys353, Ser402) was treated at the quantum level, whereas the rest of the system was treated with the Amber force field.42 When present, water, hydrogen peroxide, and bromide anion were included in the QM region. The covalent links between the QM and the MM regions were treated with a capping procedure whereby hydrogens are added to saturate the valence of the boundary QM atoms.44 The two histidines were modeled as imidazolyl fragments, the arginines as guadiniums cations, the lysine as methylamine, and, finally, the serine as methanol. Different protonation states of the Lys353, Arg360, Arg490, and Lys353 were considered as discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.3. The electrostatic coupling between the QM and the MM region was calculated using the fully Hamiltonian scheme proposed by Rothlisberger and co-workers39,40 as implemented in the Car-Parrinello code CPMD3.9.45 Briefly, the MM subsystem is split in three regions centered around the QM part. The inner region consists of enzyme residues within 7 \u00c5 of the QM part, and the electrostatic interaction energy between this region and the QM area is directly computed using the QM charge density and the MM point charges.39 To avoid an unphysical charge escape from the QM region (the so-called spill-out problem) a short-range modified Coulomb interaction was used39 to mimic Pauli repulsion at each MM atom site. The second region consists of all the residues between 7 and 18 \u00c5. The electrostatic interaction between the QM and this MM region is calculated as a point charge-point charge interaction, where the charges associated with the QM part are calculated on-the-fly using the RESP scheme proposed by Laio et al.40 Finally, the electrostatic interaction between the third region, which is composed by all the remaining MM atoms, and the QM region is computed by a multipolar expansion of the QM charge density up to the quadrupole term.39 The quantum region was described within gradient-corrected DFT using the HCTH exchange-correlation functional,46 which Figure 2. Vanadate protonation states and H-bonding patterns examined. The residues that are explicitely taken into account at the quantum level has been demonstrated to give good energy barriers,46-49 especially for proton transfers.46,49 Norm-conserving Martins-Troullier pseudo-potentials50 were used to describe the interac-tions between the core and valence electrons for all atoms except for hydrogen, where a Von Bart-Car-type pseudopotential was employed to smooth out the divergence in the Coulombic potential at the nucleus.51 The Kohn-Sham orbitals of valence electrons were expanded in plane waves with kinetic energy up to 70 Ry. For the Car-Parrinello dynamics,38 a fictitious electronic mass of 400 au was used, which allowed an integration of the equations of motion with a time step of 0.097 fs. The CP/MM simulations were started from an equilibrated structure obtained by classical MD. The positions of atoms in the QM region were optimized. Then the system was requili-brated for 1 ps at 300 K in the NVT ensemble and the configurational space was sampled for further 4-5 ps. The reliability of the use of the HCTH functional was verified by comparing HCTH/PW calculations to MP2 and B3LYP calculations with localized basis sets on vanadate/imidazole complexes in vacuo.52 For the latter, the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set was used for all of the atoms except vanadium for which the LAND2DZ along with an effective core potential was employed. These calculations indicate that only the di-and triprotonated vanadate/imidazole complexes are stable, consis-tently with previous studies.35 For the diprotonated complex, only the protomer with an axial oxidril group is stable. As a gauge for the performance of this approach in this particular system, the imidazole N-vanadium distance and relative energy of different stable protometers are reported in Table 1, which indicate a maximum error of \u22480.018 \u00c5 in V-N bond length and only \u224810 kJ/mol in relative energy with respect to MP2. 2.3. Free-Energy Calculations. Since bond breaking and forming require the crossing of a relatively large activation barrier, a method to sample the free-energy surface along the relevant reaction coordinate must be employed. In the present study, we applied the technique introduced a few years ago by Parrinello and co-workers.53,54 The method is based on a coarse-grained history-dependent dynamics (called metadynamics) that is able to explore the free energy landscape in the space defined by a chosen set of degrees of freedom, {\u03c3i} (called collective coordinates), which describe the chemical process. The evolution of the system at every step of the metadynamics is driven by the combined action of the thermodynamic force and a history-dependent force, which penalizes configurations in the collective variable space that have already been visited. The following extended Lagrangian governs the evolution of the system where LCP is the Car-Parrinello Lagrangian; Mi and ki are the ficticious mass and the coupling constant of the restraints terms, which force the collective variable \u03c3i to fluctuate around an associated \u201cdynamical\u201d variable si (see ref 54 for the details). The history-dependent potential, V(t, s) (with s ) {si}) is constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered on each value of the collective variable previously explored. The potential fills in time the minima of the free energy surface, and as the simulation proceeds, its sum converges to the free energy landscape as a function of the collective variables. It has been demonstrated that meaningful results can be obtained in a relatively short simulation time if the collective variables give a good representation of the initial and final state and include all of the slow modes, which cannot be easily sampled by direct MD.53,54 In the present calculations, atom-atom distances or difference of distances were chosen as reaction coordinates (see sections 3.2 and 3.4). Gaussians were added every 50 steps of MD dynamics. Their height was tuned according to the curvature of the underlying potential (with lower and upper bounds of 0.3 and 42 kJ/mol, respectively), while their width was set to 0.1 \u00c5. The ficticious mass and the coupling constant of the restraints was set to 50 amu and 1 (kJ/mol/\u00c52), respectively. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Protonation State of the Active Site. Knowledge of the protonation state is a prerequisite for modeling the enzymatic reaction. Here we performed geometry minimizations and CP/ MM simulations on the protonation states of the active site reported in Figure 2. The following residues were included in the QM region: the cofactor and His496, Arg360, Arg490, Lys353, Ser402, W1, and W2 (see Figure 1a). In models b and d, His404 was also included in the QM calculation. If not explicitely stated, Lys353, Arg360 and Arg490, and are taken in their protonated form. Unprotonated Vanadate (Charge -3, Models a and b). Here the axial oxygen receives H-bonds from the two waters in the active site (model a). In the geometry optimization process, Lys353 transfers one of its amino protons to the nearest vanadate equatorial oxygen. The V-N axial bond lengthens from 2.1 to 2.7 \u00c5 with the loss of the bipyramidal trigonal coordination. Inclusion of the vanadate/His404 H-bond (where His404 is taken both in the protonated form and its N\u03b4 tautomer model b) did not alter this picture. In this case, in addition to the proton transfer from Lys353, an hydrogen abstraction from His404 by the axial oxygen was also observed. Thus, our calculations suggest that this species is unstable, consistent with previous calculations,35 which showed that the complex imidazole/ VO43-in vacuo is also not stable, and the existence of a protonated axial oxygen proposed is experimentally at pH ) 8.24 Monoprotonated Vanadate (charge -2, Models c)e). Three HVO42--containing models of the enzyme were consid-ered. In the first two models, the axial oxidril group donates a H-bond to a water with (model c) and without (model d) receiving a H-bond from His404 (again in its protonated form and the N\u03b4 tautomer were considered). In the third model (model e) the axial oxidril donates a H-bond to His404 (NNone tautomer). Geometry optimization of model c leads to the abstraction of hydrogen from Lys353 by the equatorial oxygen and from N\u03b4 of His404 by the axial -OaH oxidril group with the formation of an aquavanadate. The calculated V-OaH2 distance of 2.3 \u00c5 is considerably longer than the observed V-Oa distance in the X-ray structure (1.9 \u00c5), which suggests that this protonation state may be ruled out. Optimization of model d leads, as before, TABLE 1: Imidazole N-Vanadium Distance, d (\u00c5), and to the deprotonation of Lys353, but it preserves the bipyramidal trigonal coordination of vanadium. On the other hand, optimiza-tion of model e leads to a structure characterized by bipyramidal trigonal coordination and a protonated Lys353. To access the local stability of model e a short 1 ps molecular dynamics simulation was performed. This resulted in a rapid, ca. 300 fs, hydrogen abstraction from Lys353 to the equatorial vanadate oxygen. The vanadium coordination appears to be stable on the time scale of the simulation (see Figure 3 and Table 2). Diprotonated Vanadate (Charge -1, Models f)h). Dipro-tonated states with one hydrogen on one of the equatorial oxygens (model f to h) were first optimized, and then CP/MM molecular dynamics simulations were performed. In all of these models, the bipyramidal coordination of vanadium was main-tained. However, only model f, where Oe2-H is H-bonded to, Ser402 yields an active site structure in good agreement with the crystallographic one (Figure 3 and Table 2). In the model g, the water W1, is much farther from Oa than in the crystal structure. Furthermore, in this model, the hydrogen bond Oa-H\u201a\u201a\u201aHis404 appears to be weakened and the Oe3-H group is not able to form an H-bond with the closest water molecule, which cannot access the region near the OH group. However, both Arg360 and Arg490 are still H-bonded to Oe3. If one (or both) of the arginines are considered neutral (with the CdNH nitrogen being the closest to the Oe3-H oxygen), then a rapid transfer of the equatorial proton to the arginine nitrogen and a subsequent Figure 3. Snapshots of the simulation at 300 K of (a) model e, (b) model f, and (c) model g (see Figure 2). For each protonation state two different proton transfer from Lys353 to vanadate were observed. In this case a protonation pattern identical to that of model e is obtained. It is noted that structural optimizations of simple models of the active site, similar to our model f and model g, indicated that both Oe1 and Oe3 can be protonated if Lys353 and Arg360 are, respectively, in a neutral form.35 In model h, if we assume Lys353 to be protonated, the repulsion between Lys353 and Oe1-H leads to a large distortion of the local geometry. On the other hand, if Lys353 is assumed neutral, a strong hydrogen bond between the axial oxidril group and Lys353 is formed, giving rise, again, to a structure similar to model e (Table 2). The only (triproto-nated) neutral vanadate moiety we considered (model j) underwent a structural distortion similar to the one observed for models g and h. To see which model fits best the known catalytic pocket structure, an analysis of the root-mean-square displacement from the crystal structure of the heavy atoms of the vanadate moiety and the residues His496, His404, Lys353, Ser402, Arg360, Arg490, W1, and W2 was performed (Table 3). Models e and f present the smallest deviation from the crystal structure. Considering in more detail the structure of the vanadate moiety, it is evident that only for model e is the agreement between the calculated and experimental V-Oe fairly good. When Oe2 and/or Oe3 are protonated, the V-Oe distance is too long. In this regard, we remark that we have compared the structure of the simulated protein to the crystallographic structure, which actually refers Figure 4. Formation of the hydrogen peroxide intermediate. Upper panels: chosen reactive degrees of freedom (left) and free energy landscape to different thermodynamic conditions (the former is simulated in aqueous solution at neutral pH and room temperature, whereas the latter is packed in a crystal at pH ) 8 and low temperature, i.e., 16 \u00b0C). Assuming, as is usually done in the simulation of proteins, that aqueous solution and crystal structure do not differ, our conclusions are however fully meaningful. In summary, the resting state of the enzyme likely consists of an anionic H2VO4-vanadate moiety where one hydroxo is in axial position and H-bonded to His404, whereas the other one is either H-bonded to a neutral Lys353 or to Ser402. We conclude noting that from the analysis of the electronic structure of the H2VO4-/imidazole complex, it is evident that the vanadate moiety is more likely ascribed to a dioxovanadium-(V) species (VO2+), which strongly interacts with two OH-anions (see Supporting Information). 3.2. Formation of the Peroxovanadate. We examined the formation mechanism of the peroxo intermediate by hybrid CP/ MM simulations for the various possible stable protonation states (models e, f, and g, Figure 2). As reaction coordinates we took the V-Oa distance and the asymmetric stretching coordinate defined as d(Oper -Hper) -d(Oa -Hper) (see Figure 4). Here, we explicitely discuss the results obtained for model e in detail, as the other models follow a similar reaction mechanism. In Figure 4, the free-energy landscape for the OaH-attack to the hydrogen peroxide is reported. The reactive path is characterized by the lengthening of the V-Oa distance and the increase of the asymmetric stretching coordinate describing the proton transfer from H2O2 to OaH-(Figure 4). A transition state (TS) is found for d(V -Oa) \u2248 3.8 \u00c5 and d(Oper -Hper) -d(Oa -Hper) \u2248 0.0 \u00c5 (Figure 4TS). Once the TS is crossed, a water molecule and a HOO-anion are formed (Figure 4E). The water molecule diffuses away and, at the same time, the HOO-anion binds to vanadium with the formation of an hydrogen peroxide intermediate (Figure 4I). This species is stable on the time scale of our simulation (4 ps), and it is obtained starting from all of the stable protonation states of the active site. In Figure 5, selected statistical data on distances between atoms involves the formation of an aquavanadate species and the release of HOO-that in turns attacks the vanadium center with the subsequent formation of the peroxo species. On the basis of our calculations, the HOO-is too reactive and the water is very weakly bound to vanadium (see also ref 35) to have an appreciable lifetime, expecially at acidic conditions. In this regard the mechanism found in our study, which involves a quasi-concerted H2O2 deprotonation/water release with the formation of the hydrogen peroxide intermediate, seems to be more realistic. It must be also noted that our results suggest that, at low pH, the hydrogen peroxide intermediate has probably a very short (maybe not detectable) lifetime. 3.3. Protonation State of the Peroxovanadate. After its formation the peroxovanadate cofactor can undergo several protonation equilibria. As done for the ground state of the enzyme, we have determined the most probable protonation state comparing CP/MM calculations to the crystal structure. In Figure 7, the protonation states of the peroxovanadate cofactor considered in this study are reported. The following residues were included in the QM region: the cofactor and His496, Arg360, Arg490, Lys353, Ser402, and a water molecule. Again, if not explicitely stated, Lys353, Arg360, and Arg490 are taken in their protonated form. Water Binding. All of the structures obtained from our simulations are characterized by a water molecule weakly coordinated to the metal (Figure 8 and Table 5). In the crystallographic structure, no water is reported in that position (the nearest water is at about 4.4 \u00c5 from the metal center; see Figure 1b). This molecule diffuses close to vanadium during the classical MD, because of the large empty space existing in the experimentally determined structure, and it remains stably bound during the entire CP/MM simulation. The average V-OWat distance ranges from about 3.0 \u00c5 in model j to 2.6 \u00c5 in the other models. In the simulations, the water network between the active site and the solution considerably rearranges, but, at equilibrium, almost all of the occupancies of the crystallographic positions are recovered. In model k, if we constrain the water molecule-vanadium distance to the experi-mental value in order to prevent the coordination with vanadium, a significantly longer V-NNone(His496) is obtained (2.31 instead of 2.07 \u00c5). This finding suggests that a water molecule Figure 6. Proposed reaction mechanism for the formation of the peroxovanadate cofactor (a) and the formation of the hypohalogen vanadate coordinated to vanadium might be important for the stability of the cofactor/histidine complex. Protonated Peroxo Oxygen Species (Charge 0, Models n and o). The species protonated on the peroxo oxygens (model n and o) are not stable or give rise to large distortions of the catalytic pocket with respect to crystallographic structure. This conclusion seems to be independent of the protonation state of the oxo oxygens. For the cases where Lys353 is charged, model n releases the pseudoaxial proton to the nearby water molecule, whereas in model o the N\u00fa-Oe distance lengthens to 4.3 \u00c5 (experimental 2.67 \u00c525). On one hand, when Lys353 is not protonated, both in model n and model o, the peroxo proton is promptly transferred to the lysine N\u00fa. Diprotonated Oxo Oxygen Species (Charge +1, Model m). The peroxo form with two equatorial hydroxyl groups (model m) undergoes large distortions with respect to the crystal structure (Table 5). If Lys353 is charged, the H-bonds between the peroxo moiety and both Lys353 and Arg360 are lost. The calculated average Oa-N\u00fa(Lys353) and O2-N1(Arg360) are 4.02 and 3.61 \u00c5, respectively, whereas the experimental values are 2.67 and 3.03 \u00c5. If Lys353 and/or Arg360 are not protonated the agreement with the crystal structure improves, but Oa-N\u00fa-(Lys353) and O2-N1(Arg360) distances are still to long (respec-tively, about 3.3 and 3.2 \u00c5). Unprotonated and Monoprotonated Oxo Species (Charge -1 and 0, Models j, k, and l). The anionic form (model j) and the neutral states with an equatorial oxidril group (models k and l) appear to be stable. Statistical data on distances between atoms in the active site are given in Table 5 (see also Figure 8). Among the different peroxo species, model l has structural features of the active site in good agreement with the X-ray data25 (in terms of V-O distances and H-bonds distances between the peroxo moiety and the active site residues). This species is characterized by the presence of an unprotonated peroxo group, one oxo oxygen, and one hydroxo group, which forms a weak hydrogen bond with a water molecule in the active site. Nevertheless, on the base of the root-mean-square displace-ment with respect to the crystal structure also model k shows a good agreement with experiment (Table 5). 3.4. Halide Binding and Reactivity. The last step of our investigation is the study of the bromide anion binding to the peroxovanadate cofactor and the subsequent oxo transfer pathway. Different protonation states were considered: unpro-tonated (anionic, model j), singly oxo-protonated (neutral, model k, and l), and diprotonated (positevely charged, model m) cofactors. The binding of Br-was studied by performing CP/MM simulations where the coordination water was removed and the anion was randomly placed at 4 \u00c5 from the metal center. For the neutral and positively charged species, a spontaneous binding of bromide was observed (Figure 9). Selected statistical data on distances are reported in Table 6. All of the adducts are characterized by an average V-Br distance at 300 K of about 2.6 \u00c5 and a Br-Oa distance of about 3.0 \u00c5. In contrast to what was reported for model m in section 3.3, in the adduct formed by model m, Lys353 and Arg360 are H-bonded to the peroxo-vanadate moiety (Table 6). The anionic form does not spontane-ously bind the halogen, as expected for a reaction between two negatively charged substrates. Furthermore, in model j, starting from an initial V-Br distance of 2.6 \u00c5, the halogen was immediately repelled by the cofactor. This is clearly a conse-quence of the fact (i) that the V-Br interaction is relatively weak (as indicated by the average V-Br distance) and (ii) that the negative charge delocalized on the oxo oxygens of the cofactor, which is not \u201ccompensated\u201d by the positive charges on the coordinating Arg360 and Arg490, prevents a stable binding. On the other hand, all of the attempts to find a reaction path for the direct binding of Br-to Oa failed for all of the protonation states. These findings strongly suggest that a binding of the halogen to vanadium prior oxidation may take place, as also suggested by a steady-state kinetic analysis on bromoper-oxidases.32 Previous calculations by Zampella et al.36 also support this proposal. We observe in passing that, upon halogen Figure 8. Snapshots of the simulation at 300 K of (a) model j and (b) model k of the peroxovanadate containing enzyme (see Figure 7). Selected binding all of the V-O distances slightly increase, whereas the peroxo O-O distance decrease. More remarkably, the adduct shows a considerably shorter (0.10-0.15 \u00c5) H-bond with Lys353 (Table 6). Taking as reaction coordinate the V-Br and Oa-Br distances, a pathway leading to the oxo transfer to the Br is found. Some snapshots of this process and the relative free-energy landscape for model k are reported in Figure 10. Similar pathways are Figure 9. Snapshots of the simulation at 300 K of the peroxovanadate/Br-found for the other peroxovanadate/Br-adducts. In Table 7 a summary of the reaction energetics is reported. The difference in the activation free-energy between model k and model l is quite small and within our statistical uncertainty.56 Hence, our calculations cannot discriminate between the two different protonation states, even thought model k seems to present the lowest activation barrier, in agreement with the experimental evidence.1,15,24 For model k, we have also studied the reaction assuming Lys353 as neutral. In this case, the activation free-energy increases to 32 kJ/mol. This effect of the protonation state of Lys353 was already pointed out by Zampella et al.36 Here we confirm that LysH+ polarizes the O-O peroxo bond and, as a consequence, lowers the activation energy for oxo transfer. The RESP charge difference, \u2206q, on the peroxo atoms is \u2206q(Oa-Oe) ) 0.11 e when Lys353 is charged and 0.01 e when it is neutral. The N\u00fa-H\u201a\u201a\u201aOe H-bond is very strong all along the reaction path (1.5 \u00c5 < d(H \u201a\u201a\u201aOe) < 1.7 \u00c5). During the formation of the hypohalogen vanadate, however no proton-transfer attempts from Lys353 to Oe were observed. The reaction mechanism for the initial stage of the halogen oxidation is reported in Figure 6b. 4. Conclusion In this paper, we have reported a structural analysis of the resting state of the vanadium dependent chloroperoxidase and a study of the early intermediates of the catalytic cycle. The main results obtained on the initial stages of the catalytic activity are reported in Figure 6. The investigation of different proto-nation states indicates that the rest enzyme likely consists of an anionic H2VO4-vanadate moiety where one hydroxo is in axial position and H-bonded to His404. The comparison with the crystal structure suggests that the second hydroxo group is either H-bonded to a neutral Lys353 or to Ser402. In all likelihood, depending on the pH, several different protonation states can coexist. Our calculations suggest that the hydrogen peroxide addition may not involve an initial protonation of the cofactor in contrast to previous proposals.3 We found a low free energy barrier path where the hydrogen peroxide directly attacks the axial hydroxo group with the formation of an hydrogen peroxide intermediate, which is promptly protonated in acidic conditions to form a peroxo species. Furthermore, the free energy barrier for the formation of the hydroperoxide intermediate does not depend significantly upon the protonation state of the cofactor. The most probable protonation states of the peroxo cofactor are neutral HVO2(O2) forms with hydroxo group either H-bonded to Ser402 (model k) or coordinated to Arg360 (model l). The peroxo cofactor is also coordinated to an axial water molecule, which is likely important for the stability of the peroxovanadate/His496 adduct. Our calculations do not support the protonation of one of the two peroxo oxygen as initial step of the halide oxidation. Instead, the halogen first displaces the axial water and coordinates to vanadium and then reacts with the peroxo moiety yielding a hypohalogen vanadate. The most reactive protonation state of peroxovanadate is the neutral HVO2-(O2) with the hydroxo group H-bonded to Ser402 (model k). Further studies are deemed necessary to investigate the pos-sibility that the hypohalogen vanadate intermediate is actually stable and therefore has an appreciable lifetime.4 We also confirm that a protonated Lys353 could play a crucial role determining the catalytic activity, strongly polarizing the peroxo moiety. It has been also proposed that perturbation induced by Lys353 is possibly an important factor for tuning the reactivity of the enzyme toward Cl-and Br-.36 From our calculations, however, no evidence of a proton transfer to the peroxo group is observed during the formation of the hypohalogen intermedi-ate. On the contrary, a protonated peroxo moiety, which has been proposed to participate in the reaction,15 turns out to be extremely unstable and therefore is not likely involved in the catalytic cycle.

        "A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics study of the resting state of the vanadium dependent chloroperoxidase from fungi CurVularia inaequalis and of the early intermediates of the halide oxidation is reported. The investigation of different protonation states indicates that the enzyme likely consists of an anionic H2VO4-vanadate moiety where one hydroxo group is in axial position. The calculations suggest that the hydrogen peroxide binding may not involve an initial protonation of the vanadate cofactor. A low free energy reactive path is found where the hydrogen peroxide directly attacks the axial hydroxo group, resulting in the formation of an hydrogen peroxide intermediate. This intermediate is promptly protonated to yield a peroxo species. The free energy barrier for the formation of the peroxo species does not depend significantly upon the protonation state of the cofactor. The most likely protonation states of the peroxo cofactor are neutral forms HVO2(O2) with a hydroxo group either H-bonded to Ser402 or coordinated to Arg360. The peroxo cofactor is also coordinated to an axial water molecule, which could be important for the stability of the peroxovanadate/His496 adduct. Our calculations strongly suggest that the halide oxidation may take place with the preliminary formation of a peroxovanadate/halogen adduct. Subsequently, the halogen reacts with the peroxo moiety yielding a hypohalogen vanadate. The most reactive protonation state of peroxovanadate is the neutral HVO2(O2) with the hydroxo group H-bonded to Ser402. The important role of Lys353 in determining the catalytic activity is also confirmed.",
        "1. Introduction",
        "Since the discovery of vanadium redox enzymes about 2 decades ago, there has been an increasing interest in the biological, pharmacological, and industrial applications of vanadium.1-6 Two classes of vanadium-based enzymes have so far been identified: vanadium-nitrogenases and vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases. The vanadium-nitrogenases7 acti-vate and reduces several substrates such as molecular nitrogen.8 Vanadium-haloperoxidases (VHPOs) contain vanadium(V) as vanadate or related ions and catalyze the two-electron oxidation of a halide ion, X-, to the hypohalous acids, HXO:4",
        "HXO can further react with a wide range of activated C-H bonds under acidic conditions, generating diverse halogenated natural products, in particular in the marine biosphere.2,9 The names of VHPOs are assigned on the basis of the most electronegative halide they can oxides. Thus, a vanadium chloroperoxidase is able to oxide Cl-, Br-, and I-.",
        "Understanding the reaction mechanism of these proteins may help the design of biomimetic vanadium complexes, which have attracted considerable attention as putative oxidation and oxo transfer catalysts.4,6,10-16 Peroxovanadium complexes represent good functional models of the VHPO and have been shown to epoxidize alkenes,17 hydroxylate hydrocarbons,18 and oxidize many organic compounds,14,19 and they can perform efficient enantioselective sulfoxidations.20,21",
        "Three vanadate-dependent peroxidases have been structurally characterized so far: from brown algae (Ascophyllum no-dosum),22 from red algae (Corallina officinalis),23 and from fungi (CurVularia inaequalis).24,25 For the latter, the X-ray structure of the adduct with the peroxo intermediate has also been solved.24 These enzymes possess a high degree of amino acid sequence homology in the active site cavity. These structures have revealed that the vanadate moiety is bound to the NNone of an imidazolyl ring of a proximal histidine residue, and it is further hydrogen-bonded to a distal histidine and water mol-ecules, giving rise to an trigonal-bipyramidal geometry (Figure 1a).",
        "Although a large number of organic compounds are known to be halogenated by haloperoxidases, a thorough understanding of the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood. Upon coordination of the peroxo group, it is clear that a structural rearrangement to a tetragonal pyramid takes place25 (Figure 1b). On the basis of a variety of experimental4,6,14,15,24-32 and theoretical12,33-37 studies, the following scenarios for the protonation state at the active site and reaction mechanisms have been proposed. (i) The X-ray structure of the apo form of V-ClPO is identical to the native structure, suggesting that the protein scaffold is rigid and provides a preformed cofactor binding site.26 (ii) The oxidation state of the vanadium (+V) does not change during catalysis, and therefore, the metal acts as a strong Lewis acid with respect to the actual oxidant hydrogen peroxide.3 (iii) Most likely, the axial oxygen of the vanadate-histidine complex is protonated in C. officinalis at pH ) 8.24 It is however unclear whether other oxygens of the vanadate moiety are protonated. There are three possibly positively charged groups at the active site directly coordinated to the cofactor: two guanidiniums (from Arg360 and Arg490,",

The cofactor also forms a H-bond with a serine (Ser402) and with the protein backbone peptidic N-H group (Gly403 and Arg490, Figure 1a). Recent computational studies by Pecoraro and co-workers35 of the protonation state of gas-phase models of the native VHPO indicate that the vanadate cofactor is likely in an anionic H2VO4-form that along with the charges of the enzyme pocket creates a cationic (or neutral) active site. (iv) It is supposed that the hydrogen bond between the apical cofactor OaH group and His404 makes that hydroxy unit more nucleo-philic.25 Hence, when a hydrogen peroxide molecule approaches the active site, the apical vanadate OH-is protonated and HOO-is released. The weakly bound water molecule then dissociates from the cofactor and a peroxide intermediate is generated after the formation of a second water molecule. (v) The binding site of halides or organic sulfides is not clear even thought there are evidences of a nucleophilic site opposite to the peroxo ligand.27 It has also been proposed that the first steps of halogen oxidation may involve the protonation of the peroxo group.14,15 Further computational investigations on models of the peroxo-vanadium cofactor36 suggest that the protonation state of Lys353 plays a fundamental role in activating the peroxo moiety for the oxo-transfer.",
        "All of the theoretical studies12,33-37 on VHPO performed so far are based on simple models of the active site in vacuo. Although they provide an important piece of information, it has been proposed, however, that the role of the protein environment via supramolecular interactions28 could be crucial in determining the stability of the active site. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the mechanism of formation of the peroxo intermediate and the early stages of halogen oxidation at finite temperature is still lacking.",
        "Herein we focused on vanadium chloroperoxidase form C. inaequalis. We employed ab initio (Car-Parrinello)-molecular mechanics (CP/MM) simulations38-40 (section 2) to clarify the structure of the vanadate cofactor and the reactivity vs hydrogen peroxide and bromide anion. The study was performed taking fully into account the field of the entire protein, solvent and counterions. We found that at physiological conditions the vanadate moiety is likely present as dioxovanadium(V), VO2+ coordinated to two hydroxyl anions, giving formally rise to a H2VO4-anion (section 3.1). In addition, the peroxovanadate species, which likely proceeds through a hydrogen peroxide intermediate (section 3.2), is in a monoprotonated neutral state with a water molecule coordinated in the axial position (section 3.3). The peroxo cofactor forms an adduct with the halogen, which in turn readily reacts yielding an hypohalogen vanadate species (section 3.4).",
        "2. Computational Details",
        "The study was carried out in two distinct stages. In the first stage, classical molecular dynamics (section 2.1) was used to equilibrate the vanadium haloperoxidase for C. inaequalis24 in aqueous solution. Then, hybrid QM/MM simulations (section 2.2) were performed to determine the protonation state of the active site in order to study the binding of hydrogen peroxide and, subsequently, of the bromide anion (see section 2.3).",
        "2.1. Classical Molecular Dynamics. The water solvated crystal structure of the resting state of the enzyme24 (protein data bank, pdb,41 entry: 1IDQ) and of the peroxo form24 (pdb entry: 1IDU) were relaxed in aqueous solution using classical molecular dynamics. If not otherwise stated, asparates and glutammates were taken in the anionic form, whereas lysines and arginines were considered to be positively charged. His404 was considered to be either charged or neutral (protonated at N\u03b4). Several protomers differing for number and location of the protons were considered (see model a to model p, Figures 2 and 7). The systems were enclosed in a orthorhombic cell and solvated by about 20 000 water molecules with additional Na+ counterions to ensure neutrality.",
        "The Amber42 force field was used for the protein, water, and counterions. Atom-atom parameters for vanadate and peroxo-vanadate cofactors were taken according to ref 43, whereas atomic point charges were calculated using the RESP scheme adopted in Amber for the imidazole/vanadate and imidazole/ peroxo cofactor complexes. Charges for different protonation states were calculated. During these simulations both the cofactor and His496 were constrained to the crystallographic positions. The electrostatic interactions were treated using a particle mesh Ewald summation. For each protonation state studied, equilibration was achieved by a 500 ps restrained molecular dynamics in which a harmonic potential of 20 kcal mol-1\u00c5-2 was applied to each atom. During the simulations the restraining potential was gradually switched off, thus allowing the protein structure to slowly adjust to the presence of the solvent and counterions. At the same time, the temperature was raised from 0 to 300 K using a stochastic rescaling of the atomic velocities and allowing the cell to readjust its volume. Next, the system was equilibrated for a further 0.8-1.0 ns, depending on the protonation state of the catalytic pocket, controlling the temperature with a stochastic (Berendsen)",

The final MD structures were partitioned into two parts.44 The active site (the cofactor and His496, His404, Arg360, Arg490, Lys353, Ser402) was treated at the quantum level, whereas the rest of the system was treated with the Amber force field.42 When present, water, hydrogen peroxide, and bromide anion were included in the QM region. The covalent links between the QM and the MM regions were treated with a capping procedure whereby hydrogens are added to saturate the valence of the boundary QM atoms.44 The two histidines were modeled as imidazolyl fragments, the arginines as guadiniums cations, the lysine as methylamine, and, finally, the serine as methanol. Different protonation states of the Lys353, Arg360, Arg490, and Lys353 were considered as discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.3. The electrostatic coupling between the QM and the MM region was calculated using the fully Hamiltonian scheme proposed by Rothlisberger and co-workers39,40 as implemented in the Car-Parrinello code CPMD3.9.45 Briefly, the MM subsystem is split in three regions centered around the QM part. The inner region consists of enzyme residues within 7 \u00c5 of the QM part, and the electrostatic interaction energy between this region and the QM area is directly computed using the QM charge density and the MM point charges.39 To avoid an unphysical charge escape from the QM region (the so-called spill-out problem) a short-range modified Coulomb interaction was used39 to mimic Pauli repulsion at each MM atom site. The second region consists of all the residues between 7 and 18 \u00c5. The electrostatic interaction between the QM and this MM region is calculated as a point charge-point charge interaction, where the charges associated with the QM part are calculated on-the-fly using the RESP scheme proposed by Laio et al.40 Finally, the electrostatic interaction between the third region, which is composed by all the remaining MM atoms, and the QM region is computed by a multipolar expansion of the QM charge density up to the quadrupole term.39",

For the Car-Parrinello dynamics,38 a fictitious electronic mass of 400 au was used, which allowed an integration of the equations of motion with a time step of 0.097 fs. The CP/MM simulations were started from an equilibrated structure obtained by classical MD. The positions of atoms in the QM region were optimized.

These calculations indicate that only the di-and triprotonated vanadate/imidazole complexes are stable, consis-tently with previous studies.35 For the diprotonated complex, only the protomer with an axial oxidril group is stable. As a gauge for the performance of this approach in this particular system, the imidazole N-vanadium distance and relative energy of different stable protometers are reported in Table 1, which indicate a maximum error of \u22480.018 \u00c5 in V-N bond length and only \u224810 kJ/mol in relative energy with respect to MP2.",
        "2.3. Free-Energy Calculations. Since bond breaking and forming require the crossing of a relatively large activation barrier, a method to sample the free-energy surface along the relevant reaction coordinate must be employed. In the present study, we applied the technique introduced a few years ago by Parrinello and co-workers.53,54 The method is based on a coarse-grained history-dependent dynamics (called metadynamics) that is able to explore the free energy landscape in the space defined by a chosen set of degrees of freedom, {\u03c3i} (called collective coordinates), which describe the chemical process. The evolution of the system at every step of the metadynamics is driven by the combined action of the thermodynamic force and a history-dependent force, which penalizes configurations in the collective variable space that have already been visited. The following extended Lagrangian governs the evolution of the system where LCP is the Car-Parrinello Lagrangian; Mi and ki are the ficticious mass and the coupling constant of the restraints terms, which force the collective variable \u03c3i to fluctuate around an associated \u201cdynamical\u201d variable si (see ref 54 for the details). The history-dependent potential, V(t, s) (with s ) {si}) is constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered on each value of the collective variable previously explored. The potential fills in time the minima of the free energy surface, and as the simulation proceeds, its sum converges to the free energy landscape as a function of the collective variables. It has been demonstrated that meaningful results can be obtained in a relatively short simulation time if the collective variables give a good representation of the initial and final state and include all of the slow modes, which cannot be easily sampled by direct MD.53,54",
        "In the present calculations, atom-atom distances or difference of distances were chosen as reaction coordinates (see sections 3.2 and 3.4). Gaussians were added every 50 steps of MD dynamics. Their height was tuned according to the curvature of the underlying potential (with lower and upper bounds of 0.3 and 42 kJ/mol, respectively), while their width was set to 0.1 \u00c5. The ficticious mass and the coupling constant of the restraints was set to 50 amu and 1 (kJ/mol/\u00c52), respectively.",

In the geometry optimization process, Lys353 transfers one of its amino protons to the nearest vanadate equatorial oxygen. The V-N axial bond lengthens from 2.1 to 2.7 \u00c5 with the loss of the bipyramidal trigonal coordination. Inclusion of the vanadate/His404 H-bond (where His404 is taken both in the protonated form and its N\u03b4 tautomer model b) did not alter this picture. In this case, in addition to the proton transfer from Lys353, an hydrogen abstraction from His404 by the axial oxygen was also observed. Thus, our calculations suggest that this species is unstable, consistent with previous calculations,35 which showed that the complex imidazole/ VO43-in vacuo is also not stable, and the existence of a protonated axial oxygen proposed is experimentally at pH ) 8.24",

In the first two models, the axial oxidril group donates a H-bond to a water with (model c) and without (model d) receiving a H-bond from His404 (again in its protonated form and the N\u03b4 tautomer were considered). In the third model (model e) the axial oxidril donates a H-bond to His404 (NNone tautomer). Geometry optimization of model c leads to the abstraction of hydrogen from Lys353 by the equatorial oxygen and from N\u03b4 of His404 by the axial -OaH oxidril group with the formation of an aquavanadate. The calculated V-OaH2 distance of 2.3 \u00c5 is considerably longer than the observed V-Oa distance in the X-ray structure (1.9 \u00c5), which suggests that this protonation state may be ruled out.

On the other hand, if Lys353 is assumed neutral, a strong hydrogen bond between the axial oxidril group and Lys353 is formed, giving rise, again, to a structure similar to model e (Table 2).

Considering in more detail the structure of the vanadate moiety, it is evident that only for model e is the agreement between the calculated and experimental V-Oe fairly good.

Once the TS is crossed, a water molecule and a HOO-anion are formed (Figure 4E). The water molecule diffuses away and, at the same time, the HOO-anion binds to vanadium with the formation of an hydrogen peroxide intermediate (Figure 4I).

In this regard the mechanism found in our study, which involves a quasi-concerted H2O2 deprotonation/water release with the formation of the hydrogen peroxide intermediate, seems to be more realistic. It must be also noted that our results suggest that, at low pH, the hydrogen peroxide intermediate has probably a very short (maybe not detectable) lifetime.",

This molecule diffuses close to vanadium during the classical MD, because of the large empty space existing in the experimentally determined structure, and it remains stably bound during the entire CP/MM simulation. The average V-OWat distance ranges from about 3.0 \u00c5 in model j to 2.6 \u00c5 in the other models. In the simulations, the water network between the active site and the solution considerably rearranges, but, at equilibrium, almost all of the occupancies of the crystallographic positions are recovered. In model k, if we constrain the water molecule-vanadium distance to the experi-mental value in order to prevent the coordination with vanadium, a significantly longer V-NNone(His496) is obtained (2.31 instead of 2.07 \u00c5).

The anionic form does not spontane-ously bind the halogen, as expected for a reaction between two negatively charged substrates. Furthermore, in model j, starting from an initial V-Br distance of 2.6 \u00c5, the halogen was immediately repelled by the cofactor.

In this case, the activation free-energy increases to 32 kJ/mol. This effect of the protonation state of Lys353 was already pointed out by Zampella et al.36 Here we confirm that LysH+ polarizes the O-O peroxo bond and, as a consequence, lowers the activation energy for oxo transfer.

        "4. Conclusion",
        "In this paper, we have reported a structural analysis of the resting state of the vanadium dependent chloroperoxidase and a study of the early intermediates of the catalytic cycle. The main results obtained on the initial stages of the catalytic activity are reported in Figure 6. The investigation of different proto-nation states indicates that the rest enzyme likely consists of an anionic H2VO4-vanadate moiety where one hydroxo is in axial position and H-bonded to His404. The comparison with the crystal structure suggests that the second hydroxo group is either H-bonded to a neutral Lys353 or to Ser402. In all likelihood, depending on the pH, several different protonation states can coexist. Our calculations suggest that the hydrogen peroxide addition may not involve an initial protonation of the cofactor in contrast to previous proposals.3 We found a low free energy barrier path where the hydrogen peroxide directly attacks the axial hydroxo group with the formation of an hydrogen peroxide intermediate, which is promptly protonated in acidic conditions to form a peroxo species. Furthermore, the free energy barrier for the formation of the hydroperoxide intermediate does not depend significantly upon the protonation state of the cofactor. The most probable protonation states of the peroxo cofactor are neutral HVO2(O2) forms with hydroxo group either H-bonded to Ser402 (model k) or coordinated to Arg360 (model l). The peroxo cofactor is also coordinated to an axial water molecule, which is likely important for the stability of the peroxovanadate/His496 adduct. Our calculations do not support the protonation of one of the two peroxo oxygen as initial step of the halide oxidation. Instead, the halogen first displaces the axial water and coordinates to vanadium and then reacts with the peroxo moiety yielding a hypohalogen vanadate. The most reactive protonation state of peroxovanadate is the neutral HVO2-(O2) with the hydroxo group H-bonded to Ser402 (model k). Further studies are deemed necessary to investigate the pos-sibility that the hypohalogen vanadate intermediate is actually stable and therefore has an appreciable lifetime.4 We also confirm that a protonated Lys353 could play a crucial role determining the catalytic activity, strongly polarizing the peroxo moiety. It has been also proposed that perturbation induced by Lys353 is possibly an important factor for tuning the reactivity of the enzyme toward Cl-and Br-.36 From our calculations, however, no evidence of a proton transfer to the peroxo group is observed during the formation of the hypohalogen intermedi-ate. On the contrary, a protonated peroxo moiety, which has been proposed to participate in the reaction,15 turns out to be extremely unstable and therefore is not likely involved in the catalytic cycle.",
