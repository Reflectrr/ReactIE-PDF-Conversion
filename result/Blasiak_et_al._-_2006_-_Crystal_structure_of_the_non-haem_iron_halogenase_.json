Vaillancourt2\u2020, Christopher T. Walsh2 & Catherine L. Drennan1 Non-haem Fe(II)/a-ketoglutarate (aKG)-dependent enzymes har-ness the reducing power of aKG to catalyse oxidative reactions, usually the hydroxylation of unactivated carbons, and are involved in processes such as natural product biosynthesis, the mammalian hypoxic response, and DNA repair1,2. These enzymes couple the decarboxylation of aKG with the formation of a high-energy ferryl-oxo intermediate that acts as a hydrogen-abstracting species2\u20134. All previously structurally characterized mononuclear iron enzymes contain a 2-His, 1-carboxylate motif that coordi-nates the iron1,2. The two histidines and one carboxylate, known as the \u2018facial triad\u2019, form one triangular side of an octahedral iron coordination geometry. A subclass of mononuclear iron enzymes has been shown to catalyse halogenation reactions, rather than the more typical hydroxylation reaction5,6. SyrB2, a member of this subclass, is a non-haem Fe(II)/aKG-dependent halogenase that catalyses the chlorination of threonine in syringomycin E biosyn-thesis5. Here we report the structure of SyrB2 with both a chloride ion and aKG coordinated to the iron ion at 1.6 A\u030a resolution. This structure reveals a previously unknown coordination of iron, in which the carboxylate ligand of the facial triad is replaced by a chloride ion. The gene encoding SyrB2 is found in the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster for production of the phytotoxin syringo-mycin E in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301D7 (Fig. 1a). SyrB2 catalyses the Fe(II)-, aKG-, Cl2-and O2-dependent conversion of L-Thr to 4-Cl-L-Thr (ref. 5 and Fig. 1b), a modification essential for the antifungal activity of the natural product8. SyrB2 is active on L-Thr only when the amino acid is tethered to the phospho-pantetheine prosthetic arm of the holo-SyrB1 thiolation domain5. Another class of halogenases, the flavin-dependent enzymes, have been structurally characterized and shown to catalyse halogenation at aromatic or electron-rich carbons9. Halogenation at aliphatic carbons, as in the natural products syringomycin E (ref. 7), a phytotoxin, barbamide10, a molluscicidal compound, and victorin11, a host-selective crop toxin, requires a more reactive catalyst. It has been shown that Fe(II)/aKG-dependent enzymes such as SyrB2 catalyse these more challenging halogenation reactions5,6. Other Fe(II)/aKG-dependent halogenases include BarB1/BarB2 and CmaB, which are involved in the biosynthesis of barbamide10 and the phytotoxin coronatine6, respectively. The core of SyrB2 is composed of an eight-stranded anti-parallel b-sandwich \u2018jelly-roll\u2019 motif (comprising strands b2, b12, b5, b10 and strands b9, b6, b11, b3) that defines the cupin superfamily (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). A structural alignment search for SyrB2 using the DALI server12 produced five matches with Z-scores .4, all members of the cupin superfamily. The closest structural relative, with a Z-score of 8.5, is human factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (FIH-1), an Fe(II)/aKG-dependent asparaginyl hydroxylase involved in the mammalian hypoxic response13. SyrB2 is the first structurally characterized mononuclear iron protein that does not contain the classic 2-His, 1-carboxylate iron coordination motif. The two histidine ligands (His 116 and His 235) are present, but the iron has no carboxylate ligand (Fig. 2b). Instead, this site is occupied by a chloride ion in our structure, as judged by an 8j peak in the Fo 2 F c map. To verify that this iron ligand is a halide ion, we took advantage of the ability of SyrB2 to catalyse bromination14 as well as chlorination5. Unlike chloride, which does not have a strong anomalous signal, bromide has an anomalous peak at 0.9195 A\u030a that is well separated from the iron anomalous peak at 1.7397 A\u030a. Bromide-soaked crystals were prepared and a dispersive difference Fourier map was calculated between the iron and bromide edges, confirming the location of the LETTERS Figure 1 | SyrB2 activity in syringomycin E biosynthesis. a, SyrB2 catalyses the conversion of L-Thr to 4-Cl-L-Thr, which is then incorporated into syringomycin E. b, Scheme showing the adenylation of L-Thr by SyrB1, loading of L-Thr-AMP onto the SyrB1 phosphopantetheine group, and subsequent chlorination by SyrB2.

Another bromide ion is located on the surface of each SyrB2 molecule, but it is unlikely to have biological significance. In addition to the two histidines and one chloride ligand, the remaining iron coordination sites are occupied by the aKG and a water molecule. The water molecule binds opposite His 235 at the site where dioxygen would probably bind during catalysis (Fig. 2b). aKG coordinates iron in a bidentate fashion, with the C1 carboxylate opposite His 116, and the C2 ketone opposite the chloride ligand. The aKG is anchored in the active site through hydrogen bonds between the C5 carboxylate and Thr 113, Arg 248 and Trp 145 (Fig. 2c). Bidentate binding of aKG and the arginine and threonine hydrogen-bonding interactions are conserved across many members of the Fe(II)/aKG-dependent family2, but the interaction of Trp 145 is unique to SyrB2. Phe 104 stacks above the planar aKG, whereas Arg 254 is situated 2.9 A\u030a above the aKG and may be important in positioning the C1 carboxylate. A similarly placed arginine or asparagine is observed in many other family members2. The chloride ligand in SyrB2 sits in a largely hydrophobic pocket composed of residues Ala 118, Phe 121 and the b-carbon of Ser 231. However, it also forms interactions with two water molecules, which in turn form hydrogen bonds with Thr 143 and Asn 123 (Fig. 2c). The interactions between the chloride ligand and water may be involved in lengthening the Fe\u2013Cl bond, which at 2.44 A\u030a is slightly longer than the average six-coordinate Fe(II)\u2013Cl bond length of 2.30 A\u030a found in the Cambridge Structural Database15 and other model compounds16. All other iron\u2013ligand bond lengths are typical of Fe(II)/aKG-dependent enzymes. The position of Ala 118 in SyrB2 seems to have a role in the protein\u2019s halogenase activity by creating space in the active site for the chloride ligand to bind iron. Ala 118 is completely conserved among known mononuclear iron halogenases (Supplementary Fig. 2a). A structure-based sequence alignment of SyrB2 with non-halogenase Fe(II)/aKG-dependent enzymes shows that the active site residues are located at structurally equivalent positions (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Ala 118 in SyrB2 replaces the conserved aspartate or glutamate that serves as an iron ligand in other mononuclear iron enzymes. An alignment of SyrB2 with its most structurally similar relative, FIH-1, shows replacement of the aspartate by alanine, creating space for chloride to bind (Fig. 3a). If a glutamate is modelled in place of Ala 118 in the SyrB2 structure, it is ideally positioned for iron coordination. To verify that substitution of Ala 118 with aspartate or glutamate would abolish chlorination activity while retaining iron-binding ability, A118D and A118E variants were expressed, purified and reconstituted with Fe(II) and aKG. Both variants bound Fe(II), but the mutations completely abrogated chlorination activity (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Figure 2 | Structure of SyrB2 with bound iron, chloride and aKG. Iron is shown in brown, chloride in green. a, Stereo view of the SyrB2 structure. Two protein ligands of iron (His 116 and His 235), aKG and Arg 248 are shown in stick representation.

Despite the requirement for a \u2018facial triad\u2019 of ligands in all other Fe(II)/aKG dependent hydroxylases, it seems unlikely that a carboxy-late ligand could bind to iron in SyrB2 in any conformation or stage of catalysis. The closest candidates (Asp 114 and Asp 119) are .10 A\u030a from the iron, pointing in the opposite direction (Fig. 3a). Asp 114 forms part of the b-sandwich core, and Asp 119 is not conserved. The iron coordination structure with only two direct protein ligands also helps to explain the low affinity of apo-SyrB2 for Fe(II) during reconstitution, which yields only ,35% incorporation, as opposed to reconstitution with aKG followed by Fe(II), which yields ,90% incorporation5. So far, SyrB2 crystallizes only in the presence of aKG, indicating that this cofactor provides structural stability to the protein. The structure of SyrB2 with only aKG bound has two channels leading to the active site (Fig. 3b). The loops covering the active site in this structure have higher B-factors (by 10\u201320 A\u030a2) than the average for the rest of the structure, indicating that they have some degree of mobility. Once iron and chloride bind, the protein closes down around the active site (Fig. 3c). This closure involves motions of two loops and a b-hairpin (Fig. 3d). The substrate of SyrB2, L-Thr, which is loaded on the phosphopantetheine arm of the 66-kDa SyrB1 protein, probably enters the active site through the remaining narrow tunnel above aKG (Fig. 3c). The distance from the iron to the edge of the tunnel is ,17 A\u030a, similar to the length of the extended phospho-pantetheine arm (,20 A\u030a). Access through this tunnel is limited by the side chain of Phe 196 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4), which may be involved in gating the entrance to the active site. We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that SyrB2 undergoes a conformational change on interaction with SyrB1 that opens a different passageway to the active site. In predictions of how the Fe(II)/aKG-dependent enzyme scaffold might be used for halogenation, a persistent issue was the location of the chloride. Without a structure, it was presumed that SyrB2 would contain the characteristic HX(D/E)XnH motif for iron binding. The sequence of SyrB2 does contain a conserved HXD motif, but it is located .15 A\u030a from the active site in our structure. If we assumed three protein ligands and bidentate aKG, only one coordination site for dioxygen would remain, leaving none for chloride binding. If this were true, chloride binding to iron would have to take place after decarboxylation of aKG (and subsequent release of succinate or CO2) and formation of the ferryl-oxo intermediate. However, the high-energy ferryl-oxo species is expected to be very reactive; thus, it would be unfavourable to form this intermediate before chloride were in position to react. The missing carboxylate ligand in SyrB2 elegantly solves this mechanistic dilemma. Our crystallographic data confirm that halide ions bind directly to iron, before decarboxylation of aKG and formation of a reactive ferryl-oxo species. Based on the structure of the resting state of SyrB2 and by analogy with the Fe(II)/aKG-dependent hydroxylation mechanism of TauD17, we propose a working mechanism for halogenation by SyrB2 (Fig. 4). As observed crystallographically, aKG, chloride and water coordinate the iron in the resting Fe(II) state (Fig. 4, species A). L-Thr-S-SyrB1 binding would then exclude water from the active site and allow dioxygen to bind (Fig. 4, species B and C). Decarboxylation of aKG would lead to the formation of a high-energy ferryl-oxo intermediate (Fig. 4, species D), which would then abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate. The substrate radical would abstract the chlorine atom (Fig. 4, species E), producing chlorinated L-Thr-S-SyrB1 and regenerating the reduced Fe(II) centre. After formation of the substrate carbon radical, however, some compe-tition between transfer of Cl\u2020 and OH\u2020 would be expected. No threonine hydroxylation side reaction has been detected, indicating that Cl\u2020 transfer is greatly favoured5. There are several possible explanations for this selectivity, including the positioning of the substrate in the active site during the reaction, and the lower potential of Cl\u2020 versus OH\u2020, as has been proposed to explain similar reactivity in model complexes5, 18. The crystal structure of SyrB2 reveals an unexpected iron scaffold that was not predicted from the protein sequence and provides insight into the function of Fe(II)/aKG-dependent halogenases. SyrB2 could serve as an excellent model system for studying the Figure 3 | Structural comparisons. a, View of the active site from a structural alignment of SyrB2 (grey) and FIH-1 (cyan).

METHODS Protein purification, crystallization, data collection, site-directed mutagenesis and assays of the A118D and A118E variants were done as described in Supplementary Methods. Structure determination. Phases were determined from a SAD experiment on seleno-methionine-labelled SyrB2 with aKG. Sixteen selenium sites (eight per molecule) were found in SOLVE19 and refined in SHARP20, with an acentric figure of merit of 0.431 to 2.3 A\u030a resolution. To improve the quality of the electron density map, non-crystallographic averaging (over the two molecules in the asymmetric unit) and solvent flattening were done in DM21. The initial model was built manually using XFIT22 and refined in CNS23 with non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints applied. Several rounds of iterative model building and refinement without NCS restraints followed. When the R-factors dropped below 25.5% (work) and 28.0% (free), the model was refined against the high-resolution aKG\u2013SyrB2 and Fe(II) data sets. The same set of test reflections (extended for higher resolution structures) was used to calculate R free for all models. Final rounds of refinement for all structures were done with the program REFMAC5 (ref. 24). Simulated annealing composite omit maps calculated in CNS were used to verify structures throughout refinement. The final model of aKG\u2013SyrB2 contains residues 2\u2013310 in molecule A, and residues 3\u201355, 61\u2013133 and 139\u2013310 in molecule B out of 310 residues. The final models of Cl/Br\u2013Fe(II)\u2013aKG\u2013SyrB2 contain residues 3\u201356 and 61\u2013310 in molecule A, and residues 4\u201353 and 62\u2013310 in molecule B. All structures contain one detergent molecule from the crystallization condition (n-decanoyl sucrose; DSU), bound on the surface of molecule A. The topology and parameter files for aKG were obtained from the REFMAC5 (ref. 24) dictionary, and the DSU dictionary was generated in the program SKETCHER25. Planar restraints on the sugar rings were removed for refinement. A summary of the final refinement statistics is available in Supplementary Table S1. Assessment of the models in PROCHECK26 found no unfavourable geometries and .90% of residues were in the \u2018most favoured\u2019 conformation. A dispersive difference Fourier map was calculated in CNS by subtracting the bromide inflection data from the iron inflection data using phases calculated from a model that contained only protein atoms. The observed negative dispersive difference electron density confirmed the presence of one iron site per asymmetric unit, and the positive dispersive difference electron density indicated the presence of two bromide sites (one bound to iron in the active site and one on the surface) per molecule. Secondary structure assignment was done in DSSP27, and figures were generated in PyMOL28. Received 3 November; accepted 22 December 2005. 1. Koehntop, K. D., Emerson, J. P. & Que, L.

SyrB2 is active on L-Thr only when the amino acid is tethered to the phospho-pantetheine prosthetic arm of the holo-SyrB1 thiolation domain5. Another class of halogenases, the flavin-dependent enzymes, have been structurally characterized and shown to catalyse halogenation at aromatic or electron-rich carbons9. Halogenation at aliphatic carbons, as in the natural products syringomycin E (ref. 7), a phytotoxin, barbamide10, a molluscicidal compound, and victorin11, a host-selective crop toxin, requires a more reactive catalyst. It has been shown that Fe(II)/aKG-dependent enzymes such as SyrB2 catalyse these more challenging halogenation reactions5,6. Other Fe(II)/aKG-dependent halogenases include BarB1/BarB2 and CmaB, which are involved in the biosynthesis of barbamide10 and the phytotoxin coronatine6, respectively.",
        "The core of SyrB2 is composed of an eight-stranded anti-parallel b-sandwich \u2018jelly-roll\u2019 motif (comprising strands b2, b12, b5, b10 and strands b9, b6, b11, b3) that defines the cupin superfamily (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). A structural alignment search for SyrB2 using the DALI server12 produced five matches with Z-scores .4, all members of the cupin superfamily. The closest structural relative, with a Z-score of 8.5, is human factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (FIH-1), an Fe(II)/aKG-dependent asparaginyl",

SyrB2 is the first structurally characterized mononuclear iron protein that does not contain the classic 2-His, 1-carboxylate iron coordination motif. The two histidine ligands (His 116 and His 235) are present, but the iron has no carboxylate ligand (Fig. 2b). Instead, this site is occupied by a chloride ion in our structure, as judged by an 8j peak in the Fo 2 F c map. To verify that this iron ligand is a halide ion, we took advantage of the ability of SyrB2 to catalyse bromination14 as well as chlorination5. Unlike chloride, which does not have a strong anomalous signal, bromide has an anomalous peak at 0.9195 A\u030a that is well separated from the iron anomalous peak at 1.7397 A\u030a. Bromide-soaked crystals were prepared and a dispersive difference Fourier map was calculated between the iron and bromide edges, confirming the location of the",

        "remaining iron coordination sites are occupied by the aKG and a water molecule. The water molecule binds opposite His 235 at the site where dioxygen would probably bind during catalysis (Fig. 2b). aKG coordinates iron in a bidentate fashion, with the C1 carboxylate opposite His 116, and the C2 ketone opposite the chloride ligand. The aKG is anchored in the active site through hydrogen bonds between the C5 carboxylate and Thr 113, Arg 248 and Trp 145 (Fig. 2c). Bidentate binding of aKG and the arginine and threonine hydrogen-bonding interactions are conserved across many members of the Fe(II)/aKG-dependent family2, but the interaction of Trp 145 is unique to SyrB2. Phe 104 stacks above the planar aKG, whereas Arg 254 is situated 2.9 A\u030a above the aKG and may be important in positioning the C1 carboxylate. A similarly placed arginine or asparagine is observed in many other family members2.",
        "The chloride ligand in SyrB2 sits in a largely hydrophobic pocket",
        "composed of residues Ala 118, Phe 121 and the b-carbon of Ser 231.",
        "However, it also forms interactions with two water molecules, which in turn form hydrogen bonds with Thr 143 and Asn 123 (Fig. 2c). The interactions between the chloride ligand and water may be involved in lengthening the Fe\u2013Cl bond, which at 2.44 A\u030a is slightly longer than the average six-coordinate Fe(II)\u2013Cl bond length of 2.30 A\u030a found in the Cambridge Structural Database15 and other model compounds16. All other iron\u2013ligand bond lengths are typical of Fe(II)/aKG-dependent enzymes. The position of Ala 118 in SyrB2 seems to have a role in the protein\u2019s halogenase activity by creating space in the active site for the chloride ligand to bind iron. Ala 118 is completely conserved among known mononuclear iron halogenases (Supplementary Fig. 2a). A structure-based sequence alignment of SyrB2 with non-halogenase Fe(II)/aKG-dependent enzymes shows that the active site residues are located at structurally equivalent positions (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Ala 118 in SyrB2 replaces the conserved aspartate or glutamate that serves as an iron ligand in other mononuclear iron enzymes. An alignment of SyrB2 with its most structurally similar relative, FIH-1, shows replacement of the aspartate by alanine, creating space for chloride to bind (Fig. 3a). If a glutamate is modelled in place of Ala 118 in the SyrB2 structure, it is ideally positioned for iron coordination. To verify that substitution of Ala 118 with aspartate or glutamate would abolish chlorination activity while retaining iron-binding ability, A118D and A118E variants were expressed, purified and reconstituted with Fe(II) and aKG. Both variants bound Fe(II), but the mutations completely abrogated chlorination activity (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3).",

        "Thus, in SyrB2, it seems that nature chooses alanine at this position instead of an aspartate or glutamate residue to create an iron coordination site for chloride binding.",
        "Despite the requirement for a \u2018facial triad\u2019 of ligands in all other Fe(II)/aKG dependent hydroxylases, it seems unlikely that a carboxy-late ligand could bind to iron in SyrB2 in any conformation or stage of catalysis. The closest candidates (Asp 114 and Asp 119) are .10 A\u030a from the iron, pointing in the opposite direction (Fig. 3a). Asp 114 forms part of the b-sandwich core, and Asp 119 is not conserved. The iron coordination structure with only two direct protein ligands also helps to explain the low affinity of apo-SyrB2 for Fe(II) during reconstitution, which yields only ,35% incorporation, as opposed to reconstitution with aKG followed by Fe(II), which yields ,90% incorporation5.",
        "So far, SyrB2 crystallizes only in the presence of aKG, indicating that this cofactor provides structural stability to the protein. The structure of SyrB2 with only aKG bound has two channels leading to the active site (Fig. 3b). The loops covering the active site in this structure have higher B-factors (by 10\u201320 A\u030a2) than the average for the rest of the structure, indicating that they have some degree of mobility. Once iron and chloride bind, the protein closes down around the active site (Fig. 3c). This closure involves motions of two loops and a b-hairpin (Fig. 3d). The substrate of SyrB2, L-Thr, which is loaded on the phosphopantetheine arm of the 66-kDa SyrB1 protein, probably enters the active site through the remaining narrow tunnel above aKG (Fig. 3c). The distance from the iron to the edge of the tunnel is ,17 A\u030a, similar to the length of the extended phospho-pantetheine arm (,20 A\u030a). Access through this tunnel is limited by the side chain of Phe 196 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4), which may be involved in gating the entrance to the active site. We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that SyrB2 undergoes a conformational",
        "change on interaction with SyrB1 that opens a different passageway to the active site. In predictions of how the Fe(II)/aKG-dependent enzyme scaffold might be used for halogenation, a persistent issue was the location of the chloride. Without a structure, it was presumed that SyrB2 would contain the characteristic HX(D/E)XnH motif for iron binding. The sequence of SyrB2 does contain a conserved HXD motif, but it is located .15 A\u030a from the active site in our structure. If we assumed three protein ligands and bidentate aKG, only one coordination site for dioxygen would remain, leaving none for chloride binding. If this were true, chloride binding to iron would have to take place after decarboxylation of aKG (and subsequent release of succinate or CO2) and formation of the ferryl-oxo intermediate. However, the high-energy ferryl-oxo species is expected to be very reactive; thus, it would be unfavourable to form this intermediate before chloride were in position to react. The missing carboxylate ligand in SyrB2 elegantly solves this mechanistic dilemma. Our crystallographic data confirm that halide ions bind directly to iron, before decarboxylation of aKG and formation of a reactive ferryl-oxo species. Based on the structure of the resting state of SyrB2 and by analogy with the Fe(II)/aKG-dependent hydroxylation mechanism of TauD17, we propose a working mechanism for halogenation by SyrB2 (Fig. 4). As observed crystallographically, aKG, chloride and water coordinate the iron in the resting Fe(II) state (Fig. 4, species A). L-Thr-S-SyrB1 binding would then exclude water from the active site and allow dioxygen to bind (Fig. 4, species B and C). Decarboxylation of aKG would lead to the formation of a high-energy ferryl-oxo intermediate (Fig. 4, species D), which would then abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate. The substrate radical would abstract the chlorine atom (Fig. 4, species E), producing chlorinated L-Thr-S-SyrB1 and regenerating the reduced Fe(II) centre. After formation of the substrate carbon radical, however, some compe-tition between transfer of Cl\u2020 and OH\u2020 would be expected. No threonine hydroxylation side reaction has been detected, indicating that Cl\u2020 transfer is greatly favoured5. There are several possible explanations for this selectivity, including the positioning of the substrate in the active site during the reaction, and the lower potential of Cl\u2020 versus OH\u2020, as has been proposed to explain similar reactivity in model complexes5, 18. The crystal structure of SyrB2 reveals an unexpected iron scaffold that was not predicted from the protein sequence and provides insight into the function of Fe(II)/aKG-dependent halogenases. SyrB2 could serve as an excellent model system for studying the",
