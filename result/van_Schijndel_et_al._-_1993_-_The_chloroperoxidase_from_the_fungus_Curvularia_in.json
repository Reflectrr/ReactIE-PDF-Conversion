Vollenbroek and Ron Wever E.C. Slater Institute for Biochemical Research and Biotechnology Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam (Netherlands) (Received 18 May 1992) Key words: Fungus; Chloroperoxidase; Vanadium; (C. inaequalis) The presence of vanadium-containing bromoperoxidases in various types of seaweed is well-documented. We now report that the terrestrial fungus Curvularia inaequalis excretes a novel chloroperoxidase which also contains vanadium as a prosthetic group. The chloroperoxidase is excreted in the medium as the only protein and is, therefore, almost purely obtained. Atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements showed that the chloroperoxidase contained vanadium, which was essential for enzymatic activity, in a stoichiometry of 1 mol vanadium per mol of enzyme. When the fungus was grown in media containing low concentrations of vanadate (VO43-) or when vanadate was absent, the enzyme was excreted in an apoform. Addition of vanadate to the apoenzyme purified from the medium, dialyzed holo-enzyme or growth medium led to incorporation of the metal and to a subsequent increase in specific activity from 0.7 to about 7.5 units/mg. The reduced enzyme showed an axially symmetric EPR spectrum (go = 1.971, Ao--91.7-10 -4 cm -1) with 16 hyperfine lines that is essentially the same as the EPR spectrum of the vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase of the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum. This demonstrates that the active sites in the two enzymes are very similar. The chlorinating and brominating activities of the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis were also studied and compared to those of the vanadium bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum. The chlorinating reaction catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase had a pH optimum around 5.5 and the K m for C1-was small (0.25 mM at pH 4.5), but the logarithm of its value increased linearly with increasing pH. At high bromide concentrations, the pH optima of chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxidase in the brominating reaction were about the same (5.5). However, at low bromide concentrations the pH optimum of the chloroperoxidase was at higher pH values than that of the bromoperoxidase. Introduction Haloperoxidases form a class of enzymes which are able to oxidize halides (CI-, Br-,  I-)  in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to the corresponding hypohalous acids according to: H202 +X -+H  + -~ H2 0 + H O X  (1) If a convenient nucleophilic acceptor is present, a reaction will occur with HOX and a halogenated com-pound will be formed. Haloperoxidases have been isolated from various organisms: mammals [1], marine animals [2], plants [3], algae [4], a lichen [5], fungi [6] and bacteria [7,8]. It is generally accepted that haloperoxidases are the en-zymes responsible for the formation of halogenated Correspondence to: R. Wever, E.C.

The presence in nature of halogenated antibiotics, hormones and halogenated gases is proba-bly due to the activity of these enzymes. For a long time it was believed that the only enzymes catalyzing halogenat ion were heme-containing peroxidases [6,10,11], but recently it has become clear that marine algae, lichens and microorganisms contain non-heme haloperoxidases [5,12-16]. One of the properties of the prosthetic group in vanadium bromoperoxidases is that it can be removed at low pH (rendering the enzyme inactive) by dialysis against 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer containing EDTA. Incubation of the enzyme with vanadate at neutral pH results in recovery of the brominating activity. This observation suggests that the active site in native bromoperoxidase consists of a vanadate type of structure and that the valence state of the metal in the native enzyme is 5 + (3d\u00b0). This structure is in line with results of spectroscopic tech-niques [17] with which vanadium has been identified as the prosthetic group involved in the generation of HOBr. Upon reduction a vanadyl type of EPR spec-250 trum is observed for bromoperoxidases with EPR pa-rameters which are very similar [18,19]. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the application of these enzymes, e.g., in the use of these enzymes in industrial halogenation reactions. However, the poten-tial uses of some peroxidases have been hampered by instability and costs of isolation of these enzymes [20]. During the course of screening for haloperoxidases, with a high tolerance with respect to basic pH and temperature, it was found that fungi belonging to the group of dematiaceous hyphomycetes produced haloperoxidase activity [21]. These fungi were, in fact, isolated from plant material and soils collected in the Death Valley. This desert contains one of the world's largest salt pans and is very hot and dry. Shortly after this report Liu et al. [22] reported the presence and isolation of a non-heme chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis, one of the dematiaceous hyphomycetes, which was surprisingly stable towards oxidative attack. According to Liu et al. [22], the en-zyme contained 0.7 mol of iron and 2.2 mol of zinc per mol of enzyme as measured by X-ray fluorescence. The authors, however, did not determine whether these metals were essential for enzymic activity and the na-ture of the active site in this enzyme was not estab-lished. We now report that the chloroperoxidase, that is excreted in the medium of the terrestrial fungus Curvularia inaequalis, is also a vanadium-containing enzyme and that it shows similarities with the bromo-peroxidases from various seaweeds. Materials and Methods Our studies were carried out with Curvularia inae-qualis which was obtained from the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS, Baarn, Netherlands) strain No. 102.42. In the first, so-called germination, phase a piece of fungal material was aseptically brought into a 250-ml flask containing 50 ml of a sterile germi-nation medium. This germination medium consisted of 15 g of glucose, 3 g of yeast extract, 1 ml microelement solution (0.8 g of KH2PO 4, 0.64 g of CuSO4\"5H20, 0.11 g of FeSO 4 \u2022 7H20, 0.8 g of MnCI 2 \u2022 4H20, 0.15 g of ZnSO 4 \u2022 7H20 in 1 liter of distilled water), 100/zg of thiamin and 5 ~g of biotin in 1 liter of millipore water. The flask was shaken for 5 days at 23\u00b0C. The second phase of growth was performed in 3-1 flasks containing 1 liter of a sterile fermentation medium. This fermentation medium consisted of 5 g of tryptone, 3 g of malt extract, 1 g of glucose and 3 g of yeast extract in 1 liter of millipore water. The 50-ml germina-tion medium with the grown fungal material was trans-ferred to fermentation medium and the flasks were shaken for 14 days at 23\u00b0C. After growing the fungus for 14 days in the fermen-tation medium, the fungal material was separated from the medium by centrifugation (4000\u00d7g) and the medium was bound batch-wise to DEAE-Sephacel (50 ml of DEAE-Sephacel per liter medium). The ion-ex-change material was poured into a column which was washed extensively with 0.05 M Tris-HC1 (pH 8.3) and 0.2 M NaC1, and the enzyme was eluted with 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) and 0.6 M NaCI. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Centricon 30 microconcentrators. The yield of enzyme was 10 mg per liter of fermentation medium. After concentration, the samples were filtered over active coal to remove some brown colored material. In the experiments in which the bromination reaction was studied, the en-zyme was dialyzed extensively against water to remove chloride. Bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum was pre-pared according to Wever et al. [23] as modified by de Boer et al. [13]. The enzymatic activity of the chloroperoxidase was determined spectrophotometrically on a Varian Cary-17 spectrophotometer by measuring the bromination or chlorination of monochlorodimedone (e = 20.2 mM-~cm-1 at 290 nm) [4]. The chlorinating activity was measured in a medium containing 1 mM H202, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 50 /xM monochlorodimedone and 5 mM potassium chloride. 1 unit of chloroperoxidase is defined as 1 /xmol of monochlorodimedone chlorinated per min under these conditions. The brominating activity of the chloroper-oxidase and bromoperoxidase was measured in a medium containing 1 mM H202, 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50/xM monochlorodimedone and 100 mM potassium bromide. Conditions as mentioned above were used unless specified otherwise. For the inactivation/reactivation experiments, the enzyme was dialyzed against 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 3.8) with 1 mM EDTA and thereafter against 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3). During this treatment, the enzyme partially loses its prosthetic group. Activity was restored by adding vanadate (VO43-), after which chlorinating activity was measured as mentioned above. To assess the effect of vanadate on the amount of chloroperoxidase excreted and its specific activity, several batches of C. inaequalis were grown in media containing different amounts of vanadate (0-10 /zM). The enzyme was purified from the fermentations as described above and the amount of vanadium in the enzyme preparations was deter-mined. Vanadium was determined with the standard addi-tion method using a Hitachi 180-80 Zeeman polarized Atomic Absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a Hitachi pyrolysis graphite cuvet. EPR measurements were performed on a Varian E-9 EPR spectrometer coupled to an Apple II computer. The instrument was operating at X-band frequency. Temperature, magnetic field and microwave frequency were measured as de-scribed by Albracht [24]. The protein content of the samples thus obtained was determined by the method of Bradford [25] using a protein reagent from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albu-mine as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out with 8% gels as described by Laemmli [26]. Standard pro-teins (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) used for molecular mass determination ranged from 14.4 kDa to 94 kDa and protein staining was performed with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Bromoperoxidase activity was de-tected on gels by soaking them in a solution of  1 mM o-dianisidine, 100 mM potassium bromide and 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), after which H2 0  2 was added to a concentration of 1 mM. All chemicals used were of analytical grade. Sodium acetate used for buffers was from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany and contained 0.001% chloride, dipotassium phosphate and monopotassium phosphate were from Merck, Darm-stadt, Germany and contained 0.003% and 0.0005% chloride, respectively. Water was filtered and deionised by leading it through an Elgastad B12H (Elga group) and a Milli-Q (Millipore) water-purification system.

The molecular mass of this band is the same as reported by Liu et al. [22]. Under denaturing conditions, SDS-PAGE yields for all vanadium bromoperoxidases a single subunit with a molecular mass of also about 65 kDa [27]. We assume therefore that the chloroperoxi-dase from C. inaequalis consists of one single subunit (67 kDa). Under these denaturing conditions all en-zymic activity was lost. When the enzyme was not boiled in SDS, it remained active and two bands were observed which stained both for activity and protein. The band with the high molecular mass probably rep-resents an aggregated form of the enzyme. Little is known about the steady-state kinetics of the chlorination catalyzed by chloroperoxidase except for the limited study by Liu et al. [22]. Fig. 2a and 2b show the activity of the chloroperoxidase as a function of pH at various CI-and Br-concentrations. As in most peroxidases, the enzyme showed a pH-optimum in both reactions. As can be seen, the pH optima for bromina-tion and chlorination catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis were about equal (pH 5.5). The enzyme, however, was inhibited at low pH values by excess bromide but not by excess chloride. The concen-tration of chloride slightly affected the position of the pH optimum in the chlorination. Comparison of Fig. 2a with 2b also shows that bromide is oxidized by the chloroperoxidase at a slightly higher rate than chloride (CI-turnover= 12 s -1, Br-turnover =41 s-l).  The low activity detected at pH 4-5 when no chloride was present may be due to traces of chloride in the buffer. However, another peroxidative reaction, the origin of which is unknown, may also occur. For comparison, the pH-dependence of the bromoperoxidase from A. no-dosum is also given (Fig. 2c). It is clear that the pH optimum for bromination by the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis (pH 5.2) is higher than the pH optimum for bromination by the bromoperoxidase from A. no-dosum when measured at a Br-concentration of 10 mM. Fig. 2a also shows that at high pH the chloride concentrations used were not high enough to saturate the enzyme completely. Therefore, the K m for chloride was determined as a function of pH. Fig. 3 shows that, in line with Fig. 2a, the logarithm of the K~, increased linearly with increasing pH from 0.25 mM at pH 4.5 to 116 mM at pH 8. The high affinity for chloride at low pH probably explains why the enzyme is able to use traces of chloride in the buffer. In our initial attempts to isolate the enzyme, highly variable yields in terms of activity were observed in some batches of the fermentation medium. Further, when the turnover of the purified chloroperoxidase in the monochlorodimedone assay was compared with the turnover found by Liu et al. [22] for the same enzyme 252 (240 s-l ) ,  it was found that our enzyme preparations had a much lower activity (1 s-l ) .  Since it is known that vanadium bromoperoxidases in the apoform can be activated by vanadate [12,13] and that vanadium bromoperoxidases when isolated from seaweed contain in general less than stoichiometric amounts of vana-dium, we assumed that C. inaequalis excreted chloroperoxidase as an apo-enzyme. To investigate this, batches of C. inaequalis were grown in media contain-ing different amounts of vanadium (0-10 tzM final concentration) added as sodium orthovanadate and the enzymic activity was measured both in these media as E 0.1 ._> 0.2 A' 0.0 5 6 pH 2.5 0.5 ~ l.S ,\u00a2 \"5 1.0 0.0 I 1 I I, 4 S 6 7 B 2.0 pH 0.4 0.5 t ' -~.~ 0.2 ._> \"6 0.1 C , , , ~,0 I | | | I 3 4 ,5 6 7 8 9 pH Fig. 2.

It was observed that, when 10 /zM vanadate was present, the enzymic activity increased a factor of 10 compared to media to which no vanadate was added. Further, enzyme prepared from media to which no or low concentrations of vanadate were added contained less than stoichio-metric amounts of vanadium (results not shown) as-suming a molecular mass of 67 kDa, as suggested by SDS-PAGE. It was also tested whether the enzyme purified from media containing vanadate could be inactivated al low pH as is observed for the vanadium bromoperoxidases and, therefore, purified chloroperoxidase was inacti-vated at low pH by treatment with citrate buffer (pH 3.8) containing 1 mM EDTA to remove all vanadium (see Materials and Methods). After inactivation and dialysis against 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), the specific activity of the enzyme decreased from 5.6 U/mg to 2.3 U /mg  in the inactivated enzyme. It was not possible to inactivate the enzyme completely using this procedure. Lowering of the pH in the inactivation buffer from 3.8 to 3.2 resulted in denaturation of the protein and loss of activity. Fig. 4 shows that the enzyme was reacti-vated completely after incubation of the apo-protein in vanadate solutions for 24 h and suggested that vana-date was essential for the activity of the chloroperoxi-dase from C. inaequalis as had already been suggested by the observation that an inactive apo-enzyme was excreted into the medium when no vanadate was pre-sent. To establish that there is a relationship between specific activity and vanadium content a reactivation experiment was performed with apo-enzyme, which was obtained by growing the fungus in medium without 253 8 A t7 6 ._> 13 m 5 0 u~ u) 3 -0 .5 2 i i i i i 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Vanadate added (p.M) Fig. 4.

Thus, titration of apo-chlo-roperoxidase obtained by incubation at low pH or apo-chloroperoxidase obtained by growing the fungus in media without vanadate give the same result. The addition of vanadate after 2 weeks of growth to media to which no additional vanadate was added led to a rise in activity within one day, also showing that vana-date had been incorporated in an already excreted apo-enzyme in the medium. The evidence that vanadium was present in the isolated chloroperoxidase was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance. In the enzyme as isolated no EPR signals were detectable. However, when the chloroperoxidase was reduced with a small excess of sodium dithionite, a typical vanadyl type of spectrum is observed (Fig. 6, trace b). For comparison the spec-trum of the vanadium containing bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum is also shown (Fig. 6, trace a). It is obvious that the spectra of bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum and chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis are very simi-lar. The linewidth of the hyperfine lines in chloroper-oxidase is, however, larger. For instance, the linewidth of the parallel mll = -5 / 2  hyperfine line of reduced bromoperoxidase was 2.25 mT, whereas that in chloroperoxidase was 3.75 mT. The spectral parame-ters are go = 1.971 and Ao = 91.7-10 -4 cm -]  where go is derived from the relation go = gJ 3  + 2\"g \u00b1/3 and the hyperfine coupling constant Ao =A n / 3 +  2. A ./ 3 .  This result confirms that the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis is also a vanadium enzyme. Further-more, it suggests that the ligands for the prosthetic group and the way the protein is wrapped around the prosthetic group are very similar for the chloroperoxi-dase from the fungus C inaequalis and the bromoper-oxidase from the seaweed A. nodosum. Discussion In this study, we have presented data on the nature of the prosthetic group of the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis and some of its properties. SDS-PAGE and staining for both protein and enzymatic activity showed that the isolated enzyme was pure. Boiling in the presence of SDS and /3-mercaptoethanol yielded a single band with a mass of around 67 kDa, which corresponds to that seen in all vanadium bromoperoxi-dases [27,28]. When the activity of fully-reconstituted chloro-peroxidase preparations in our studies was compared to results obtained by Liu et al. [22] a much lower activity in the chlorination of monochlorodimedone was observed (12 vs. 240 s-l ) .  This discrepancy re-mains unexplained. The yield of enzyme in terms of enzymatic activity was also highly variable, which sug-gested that an apo-enzyme was secreted into the medium. Therefore, vanadate was added to the fer-mentation medium and, indeed, this led to the produc-tion of more enzyme activity in the medium. The purified enzyme from such cultures had a much higher specific activity than that from cultures to which no vanadate was added. The specific activity in the chlori-nation (7.5 U/ m g )  however, was still lower than re-ported for various fully reactivated vanadium bro-moperoxidases, such as the bromoperoxidases from Fucus distichus (1500 U/ m g )  [29], L. saccharina (615 U / m g  [18]) and A. nodosum I (126 U/ m g )  [30]. The low enzymic activity of preparations isolated from me-dia to which no vanadate was added is probably due to traces of vanadium in the growth media. From vana-date titration experiments with enzyme from C inae-qualis grown in media without vanadate, it was found that full activity was restored at a stoichiometry of 1 mol vanadate per mol of the apo-enzyme. Further, a linear relationship was found between specific activity and vanadium content of the preparation and our observations show clearly that vanadate is essential for the enzymatic activity of the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis. Whether other metal ions, like iron and zinc, which have been shown to be present in the chloroperoxidase isolated by Liu et al. [22], have a role in catalysis is not clear yet. It should be noted, how-ever, that zinc is often found as a contaminant in proteins and is difficult to remove. When the purified enzyme was reduced with sodium dithionite, an EPR signal was detected that was typical of a vanadyl species and with EPR parameters compa-255 rable to those of the vanadium bromoperoxidases from A. nodosum and other seaweed species. From this observation one may conclude that the native chloroperoxidase also contains vanadium in the 5 + oxidation state [13] which is in line with the observation that the apo-enzyme was activated by orthovanadate (VO43-) in which vanadium is in its highest oxidation state. That the EPR parameters are so similar indi-cates that the structure and the way in which the vanadyl group is ligated into the protein are very similar in both chloroperoxidases and bromoperoxi-dases. This is extremely interesting; in some way the protein part and surrounding amino acids have been tuned and modified via evolution to increase the oxi-dizing ability of the prosthetic group of the enzyme, which allows the enzyme to oxidize chloride. In this respect, it is of great interest that it has been shown that the bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum also cata-lyzes chlorination reactions [31] with a specific activity that is about 15-times lower than the value reported here for the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis. How-ever, in the case of bromoperoxidase, very high concen-trations of chloride (up to 1.5 M) had to be used, whereas the chloroperoxidase was able to use much lower concentrations of chloride. The pH optima in the bromination and chlorination reactions catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase are almost equal (pH 5.5). Soedjak and Butler [31] also report that the pH optimum for chloroperoxidase activity by bro-moperoxidase is at pH 5.0, which is the same for bromoperoxidase activity. In this respect these enzymes seem to differ from heme-containing haloperoxidases. For instance for myeloperoxidase, the pH optimum for chlorinating activity is about 0.5 pH unit lower than that for brominating activity [32]. The logarithm of the K m for CI-is linearly depen-dent on the pH, the slope of the line being about 0.7. This suggests that during the catalytic cycle protons have to be taken up simultaneously with chloride or alternatively a group has to be protonated to allow binding of chloride. A more detailed kinetic analysis at higher and lower pH is required to distinguish between the two possibilities. This behavior is in clear contrast to that which was observed in the oxidation of bromide by bromoperoxidase [33]. It is striking that excess chlo-ride did not inhibit the chlorinating activity of chloroperoxidase, whereas excess bromide did inhibit the brominating activity as was also observed for the vanadium bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum. These differences in kinetic behaviour may reflect changes in the catalytic mechanism and/or the presence of other amino-acid residues involved in the catalytic cycle. Detailed analysis of similarities and differences be-tween the two enzymes in their kinetic properties may well lead to important clues concerning the catalytic action. However, definite conclusions still have to await knowledge of the tertiary structure of these interesting enzymes.

        "The presence of vanadium-containing bromoperoxidases in various types of seaweed is well-documented. We now report that the terrestrial fungus Curvularia inaequalis excretes a novel chloroperoxidase which also contains vanadium as a prosthetic group. The chloroperoxidase is excreted in the medium as the only protein and is, therefore, almost purely obtained. Atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements showed that the chloroperoxidase contained vanadium, which was essential for enzymatic activity, in a stoichiometry of 1 mol vanadium per mol of enzyme. When the fungus was grown in media containing low concentrations of vanadate (VO43-) or when vanadate was absent, the enzyme was excreted in an apoform. Addition of vanadate to the apoenzyme purified from the medium, dialyzed holo-enzyme or growth medium led to incorporation of the metal and to a subsequent increase in specific activity from 0.7 to about 7.5 units/mg. The reduced enzyme showed an axially symmetric EPR spectrum (go = 1.971, Ao--91.7-10 -4 cm -1) with 16 hyperfine lines that is essentially the same as the EPR spectrum of the vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase of the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum. This demonstrates that the active sites in the two enzymes are very similar. The chlorinating and brominating activities of the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis were also studied and compared to those of the vanadium bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum. The chlorinating reaction catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase had a pH optimum around 5.5 and the K m for C1-was small (0.25 mM at pH 4.5), but the logarithm of its value increased linearly with increasing pH. At high bromide concentrations, the pH optima of chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxidase in the brominating reaction were about the same (5.5). However, at low bromide concentrations the pH optimum of the chloroperoxidase was at higher pH values than that of the bromoperoxidase.",

The presence in nature of halogenated antibiotics, hormones and halogenated gases is proba-bly due to the activity of these enzymes. For a long time it was believed that the only enzymes catalyzing halogenat ion were heme-containing peroxidases [6,10,11], but recently it has become clear that marine algae, lichens and microorganisms contain non-heme haloperoxidases [5,12-16]. One of the properties of the prosthetic group in vanadium bromoperoxidases is that it can be removed at low pH (rendering the enzyme inactive) by dialysis against 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer containing EDTA. Incubation of the enzyme with vanadate at neutral pH results in recovery of the brominating activity. This observation suggests that the active site in native bromoperoxidase consists of a vanadate type of structure and that the valence state of the metal in the native enzyme is 5 + (3d\u00b0). This structure is in line with results of spectroscopic tech-niques [17] with which vanadium has been identified as the prosthetic group involved in the generation of HOBr. Upon reduction a vanadyl type of EPR spec-",

In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the application of these enzymes, e.g., in the use of these enzymes in industrial halogenation reactions. However, the poten-tial uses of some peroxidases have been hampered by instability and costs of isolation of these enzymes [20].",
        "During the course of screening for haloperoxidases, with a high tolerance with respect to basic pH and temperature, it was found that fungi belonging to the group of dematiaceous hyphomycetes produced haloperoxidase activity [21]. These fungi were, in fact, isolated from plant material and soils collected in the Death Valley. This desert contains one of the world's largest salt pans and is very hot and dry. Shortly after this report Liu et al. [22] reported the presence and isolation of a non-heme chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis, one of the dematiaceous hyphomycetes, which was surprisingly stable towards oxidative attack. According to Liu et al. [22], the en-zyme contained 0.7 mol of iron and 2.2 mol of zinc per mol of enzyme as measured by X-ray fluorescence. The authors, however, did not determine whether these metals were essential for enzymic activity and the na-ture of the active site in this enzyme was not estab-lished. We now report that the chloroperoxidase, that is excreted in the medium of the terrestrial fungus Curvularia inaequalis, is also a vanadium-containing enzyme and that it shows similarities with the bromo-peroxidases from various seaweeds.",
        "Materials and Methods",
        "Our studies were carried out with Curvularia inae-qualis which was obtained from the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS, Baarn, Netherlands) strain No. 102.42. In the first, so-called germination, phase a piece of fungal material was aseptically brought into a 250-ml flask containing 50 ml of a sterile germi-nation medium. This germination medium consisted of 15 g of glucose, 3 g of yeast extract, 1 ml microelement solution (0.8 g of KH2PO 4, 0.64 g of CuSO4\"5H20, 0.11 g of FeSO 4 \u2022 7H20, 0.8 g of MnCI 2 \u2022 4H20, 0.15 g of ZnSO 4 \u2022 7H20 in 1 liter of distilled water), 100/zg of thiamin and 5 ~g of biotin in 1 liter of millipore water. The flask was shaken for 5 days at 23\u00b0C. The second phase of growth was performed in 3-1 flasks containing 1 liter of a sterile fermentation medium. This fermentation medium consisted of 5 g of tryptone, 3 g of malt extract, 1 g of glucose and 3 g of yeast extract in 1 liter of millipore water. The 50-ml germina-tion medium with the grown fungal material was trans-ferred to fermentation medium and the flasks were shaken for 14 days at 23\u00b0C.",
        "After growing the fungus for 14 days in the fermen-tation medium, the fungal material was separated from the medium by centrifugation (4000\u00d7g) and the medium was bound batch-wise to DEAE-Sephacel (50 ml of DEAE-Sephacel per liter medium). The ion-ex-change material was poured into a column which was washed extensively with 0.05 M Tris-HC1 (pH 8.3) and 0.2 M NaC1, and the enzyme was eluted with 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) and 0.6 M NaCI. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Centricon 30 microconcentrators. The yield of enzyme was 10 mg per liter of fermentation medium. After concentration, the samples were filtered over active coal to remove some brown colored material. In the experiments in which the bromination reaction was studied, the en-zyme was dialyzed extensively against water to remove chloride. Bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum was pre-pared according to Wever et al. [23] as modified by de Boer et al. [13].",
        "The enzymatic activity of the chloroperoxidase was determined spectrophotometrically on a Varian Cary-17 spectrophotometer by measuring the bromination or chlorination of monochlorodimedone (e = 20.2 mM-~cm-1 at 290 nm) [4]. The chlorinating activity was measured in a medium containing 1 mM H202, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 50 /xM monochlorodimedone and 5 mM potassium chloride. 1 unit of chloroperoxidase is defined as 1 /xmol of monochlorodimedone chlorinated per min under these conditions. The brominating activity of the chloroper-oxidase and bromoperoxidase was measured in a medium containing 1 mM H202, 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50/xM monochlorodimedone and 100 mM potassium bromide. Conditions as mentioned above were used unless specified otherwise. For the inactivation/reactivation experiments, the enzyme was dialyzed against 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 3.8) with 1 mM EDTA and thereafter against 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3). During this treatment, the enzyme partially loses its prosthetic group. Activity was restored by adding vanadate (VO43-), after which chlorinating activity was measured as mentioned above. To assess the effect of vanadate on the amount of chloroperoxidase excreted and its specific activity, several batches of C. inaequalis were grown in media containing different amounts of vanadate (0-10 /zM). The enzyme was purified from the fermentations as described above and the amount of vanadium in the enzyme preparations was deter-mined.",
        "Vanadium was determined with the standard addi-tion method using a Hitachi 180-80 Zeeman polarized Atomic Absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a Hitachi pyrolysis graphite cuvet. EPR measurements were performed on a Varian E-9 EPR spectrometer coupled to an Apple II computer. The instrument was operating at X-band frequency. Temperature, magnetic field and microwave frequency were measured as de-scribed by Albracht [24].",
        "The protein content of the samples thus obtained was determined by the method of Bradford [25] using a protein reagent from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albu-mine as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out with 8% gels as described by Laemmli [26]. Standard pro-teins (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) used for molecular mass determination ranged from 14.4 kDa to 94 kDa and protein staining was performed with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Bromoperoxidase activity was de-tected on gels by soaking them in a solution of  1 mM o-dianisidine, 100 mM potassium bromide and 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), after which H2 0  2 was added to a concentration of 1 mM. All chemicals used were of analytical grade. Sodium acetate used for buffers was from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany and contained 0.001% chloride, dipotassium phosphate and monopotassium phosphate were from Merck, Darm-stadt, Germany and contained 0.003% and 0.0005% chloride, respectively. Water was filtered and deionised by leading it through an Elgastad B12H (Elga group) and a Milli-Q (Millipore) water-purification system.",

The molecular mass of this band is the same as reported by Liu et al. [22]. Under denaturing conditions, SDS-PAGE yields for all vanadium bromoperoxidases a single subunit with a molecular mass of also about 65 kDa [27]. We assume therefore that the chloroperoxi-dase from C. inaequalis consists of one single subunit (67 kDa). Under these denaturing conditions all en-zymic activity was lost. When the enzyme was not boiled in SDS, it remained active and two bands were observed which stained both for activity and protein. The band with the high molecular mass probably rep-resents an aggregated form of the enzyme.",
        "Little is known about the steady-state kinetics of the chlorination catalyzed by chloroperoxidase except for the limited study by Liu et al. [22]. Fig. 2a and 2b show the activity of the chloroperoxidase as a function of pH at various CI-and Br-concentrations. As in most peroxidases, the enzyme showed a pH-optimum in both reactions. As can be seen, the pH optima for bromina-tion and chlorination catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis were about equal (pH 5.5). The enzyme, however, was inhibited at low pH values by excess bromide but not by excess chloride. The concen-tration of chloride slightly affected the position of the pH optimum in the chlorination. Comparison of Fig. 2a with 2b also shows that bromide is oxidized by the chloroperoxidase at a slightly higher rate than chloride (CI-turnover= 12 s -1, Br-turnover =41 s-l).  The low activity detected at pH 4-5 when no chloride was present may be due to traces of chloride in the buffer. However, another peroxidative reaction, the origin of which is unknown, may also occur. For comparison, the pH-dependence of the bromoperoxidase from A. no-dosum is also given (Fig. 2c). It is clear that the pH optimum for bromination by the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis (pH 5.2) is higher than the pH optimum for bromination by the bromoperoxidase from A. no-dosum when measured at a Br-concentration of 10 mM. Fig. 2a also shows that at high pH the chloride concentrations used were not high enough to saturate the enzyme completely. Therefore, the K m for chloride was determined as a function of pH. Fig. 3 shows that, in line with Fig. 2a, the logarithm of the K~, increased linearly with increasing pH from 0.25 mM at pH 4.5 to 116 mM at pH 8. The high affinity for chloride at low pH probably explains why the enzyme is able to use traces of chloride in the buffer.",
        "In our initial attempts to isolate the enzyme, highly variable yields in terms of activity were observed in some batches of the fermentation medium. Further, when the turnover of the purified chloroperoxidase in the monochlorodimedone assay was compared with the turnover found by Liu et al. [22] for the same enzyme",

Since it is known that vanadium bromoperoxidases in the apoform can be activated by vanadate [12,13] and that vanadium bromoperoxidases when isolated from seaweed contain in general less than stoichiometric amounts of vana-dium, we assumed that C. inaequalis excreted chloroperoxidase as an apo-enzyme. To investigate this, batches of C. inaequalis were grown in media contain-ing different amounts of vanadium (0-10 tzM final concentration) added as sodium orthovanadate and the enzymic activity was measured both in these media as",

Thus, titration of apo-chlo-roperoxidase obtained by incubation at low pH or apo-chloroperoxidase obtained by growing the fungus in media without vanadate give the same result. The addition of vanadate after 2 weeks of growth to media to which no additional vanadate was added led to a rise in activity within one day, also showing that vana-date had been incorporated in an already excreted apo-enzyme in the medium.",
        "The evidence that vanadium was present in the isolated chloroperoxidase was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance. In the enzyme as isolated no EPR signals were detectable. However, when the chloroperoxidase was reduced with a small excess of sodium dithionite, a typical vanadyl type of spectrum is observed (Fig. 6, trace b). For comparison the spec-trum of the vanadium containing bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum is also shown (Fig. 6, trace a). It is obvious that the spectra of bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum and chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis are very simi-lar. The linewidth of the hyperfine lines in chloroper-oxidase is, however, larger. For instance, the linewidth of the parallel mll = -5 / 2  hyperfine line of reduced bromoperoxidase was 2.25 mT, whereas that in chloroperoxidase was 3.75 mT. The spectral parame-ters are go = 1.971 and Ao = 91.7-10 -4 cm -]  where go is derived from the relation go = gJ 3  + 2\"g \u00b1/3 and the hyperfine coupling constant Ao =A n / 3 +  2. A ./ 3 .  This result confirms that the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis is also a vanadium enzyme. Further-more, it suggests that the ligands for the prosthetic group and the way the protein is wrapped around the prosthetic group are very similar for the chloroperoxi-dase from the fungus C inaequalis and the bromoper-oxidase from the seaweed A. nodosum.",
        "Discussion",
        "In this study, we have presented data on the nature of the prosthetic group of the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis and some of its properties. SDS-PAGE and staining for both protein and enzymatic activity showed that the isolated enzyme was pure. Boiling in the presence of SDS and /3-mercaptoethanol yielded a single band with a mass of around 67 kDa, which corresponds to that seen in all vanadium bromoperoxi-dases [27,28].",
        "When the activity of fully-reconstituted chloro-peroxidase preparations in our studies was compared to results obtained by Liu et al. [22] a much lower activity in the chlorination of monochlorodimedone was observed (12 vs. 240 s-l ) .  This discrepancy re-mains unexplained. The yield of enzyme in terms of enzymatic activity was also highly variable, which sug-gested that an apo-enzyme was secreted into the medium. Therefore, vanadate was added to the fer-mentation medium and, indeed, this led to the produc-tion of more enzyme activity in the medium. The purified enzyme from such cultures had a much higher specific activity than that from cultures to which no vanadate was added. The specific activity in the chlori-nation (7.5 U/ m g )  however, was still lower than re-ported for various fully reactivated vanadium bro-moperoxidases, such as the bromoperoxidases from Fucus distichus (1500 U/ m g )  [29], L. saccharina (615 U / m g  [18]) and A. nodosum I (126 U/ m g )  [30]. The low enzymic activity of preparations isolated from me-dia to which no vanadate was added is probably due to traces of vanadium in the growth media. From vana-date titration experiments with enzyme from C inae-qualis grown in media without vanadate, it was found that full activity was restored at a stoichiometry of 1 mol vanadate per mol of the apo-enzyme. Further, a linear relationship was found between specific activity and vanadium content of the preparation and our observations show clearly that vanadate is essential for the enzymatic activity of the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis. Whether other metal ions, like iron and zinc, which have been shown to be present in the chloroperoxidase isolated by Liu et al. [22], have a role in catalysis is not clear yet. It should be noted, how-ever, that zinc is often found as a contaminant in proteins and is difficult to remove.",

        "rable to those of the vanadium bromoperoxidases from A. nodosum and other seaweed species. From this observation one may conclude that the native chloroperoxidase also contains vanadium in the 5 + oxidation state [13] which is in line with the observation that the apo-enzyme was activated by orthovanadate (VO43-) in which vanadium is in its highest oxidation state. That the EPR parameters are so similar indi-cates that the structure and the way in which the vanadyl group is ligated into the protein are very similar in both chloroperoxidases and bromoperoxi-dases. This is extremely interesting; in some way the protein part and surrounding amino acids have been tuned and modified via evolution to increase the oxi-dizing ability of the prosthetic group of the enzyme, which allows the enzyme to oxidize chloride. In this respect, it is of great interest that it has been shown that the bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum also cata-lyzes chlorination reactions [31] with a specific activity that is about 15-times lower than the value reported here for the chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis. How-ever, in the case of bromoperoxidase, very high concen-trations of chloride (up to 1.5 M) had to be used, whereas the chloroperoxidase was able to use much lower concentrations of chloride.",
        "The pH optima in the bromination and chlorination reactions catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase are almost equal (pH 5.5). Soedjak and Butler [31] also report that the pH optimum for chloroperoxidase activity by bro-moperoxidase is at pH 5.0, which is the same for bromoperoxidase activity. In this respect these enzymes seem to differ from heme-containing haloperoxidases. For instance for myeloperoxidase, the pH optimum for chlorinating activity is about 0.5 pH unit lower than that for brominating activity [32].",
        "The logarithm of the K m for CI-is linearly depen-dent on the pH, the slope of the line being about 0.7. This suggests that during the catalytic cycle protons have to be taken up simultaneously with chloride or alternatively a group has to be protonated to allow binding of chloride. A more detailed kinetic analysis at higher and lower pH is required to distinguish between the two possibilities. This behavior is in clear contrast to that which was observed in the oxidation of bromide by bromoperoxidase [33]. It is striking that excess chlo-ride did not inhibit the chlorinating activity of chloroperoxidase, whereas excess bromide did inhibit the brominating activity as was also observed for the vanadium bromoperoxidase from A. nodosum. These differences in kinetic behaviour may reflect changes in the catalytic mechanism and/or the presence of other amino-acid residues involved in the catalytic cycle. Detailed analysis of similarities and differences be-tween the two enzymes in their kinetic properties may well lead to important clues concerning the catalytic action. However, definite conclusions still have to await knowledge of the tertiary structure of these interesting enzymes.",
