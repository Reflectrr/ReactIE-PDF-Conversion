McDonough5 From the Chemistry Research Laboratory, The Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Mansfield Road, Oxford OX1 3TA, United Kingdom A 2-His-1-carboxylate triad of iron binding residues is pres-ent in many non-heme iron oxygenases including the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenases. Three variants (D201A, D201E, and D201G) of the iron binding Asp-201 resi-due of an asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), were made and analyzed. FIH-D201A and FIH-D201E did not catalyze asparaginyl hydroxylation, but in the presence of a reducing agent, they displayed enhanced 2OG turnover when compared with wild-type FIH. Turnover of 2OG by FIH-D201A was significantly stimulated by the addition of HIF-1None786\u2013826 peptide. Like FIH-D201A and D201E, the D201G variant enhanced 2OG turnover but rather unexpectedly catalyzed asparaginyl hydroxylation. Crystal structures of the FIH-D201A and D201G variants in complex with Fe(II)/Zn(II), 2OG, and HIF-1None786\u2013826/788\u2013806 implied that only two FIH-based resi-dues (His-199 and His-279) are required for metal binding. The results indicate that variation of 2OG-dependent dioxygenase iron-ligating residues as a means of functional assignment should be treated with caution. The results are of mechanistic interest in the light of recent biochemical and structural analy-ses of non-heme iron and 2OG-dependent halogenases that are similar to the FIH-D201A/G variants in that they use only two His-residues to ligate iron. The 2-His-1-carboxylate iron binding triad (HX(D/E) . . . H) is an extensively conserved feature of the active site of the non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases and oxidases, including the 2OG6-dependent dioxygenase family (2OG oxygenases). Crys-tallographic and spectroscopic studies imply that the enzymeNoneFeNone2OG intermediate has an octahedral metal coordi-nation, with three of the coordination sites occupied by the 2-oxo-acid of 2OG and a water molecule. In some cases, bind-ing of substrate to this complex has been shown to induce loss of the iron bound water so enabling dioxygen binding. Oxida-tive decarboxylation of 2OG results in the formation of a ferryl species (Fe(VI)NoneO) that effects oxidation of the substrate/co-substrate with the regeneration of Fe(II) at the active site (for review, see Refs. 1\u20133). In addition, spectroscopic studies have demonstrated that interaction of the non-iron-ligated oxygen atomof the carboxylate side chain of themetal bindingAsp/Glu residuewith the iron boundwatermolecule has a role in oxygen activation (4). Hydroxylation is themost common reaction catalyzed by the 2OG oxygenases, but family members also catalyze other oxi-dative reactions including demethylations, desaturations, epoxidations, and rearrangements. Related enzymes, which do not employ 2OG as a co-substrate, have been shown to catalyze oxidative fragmentations and cyclization reactions (for review, see Refs. 2 and 5). Recently, two 2OG oxygenases have been reported to catalyze oxidative halogenations (6, 7); the struc-ture of one of these halogenases, SyrB2, revealed that the iron was coordinated by only two enzyme-derived His residues (8). The carboxylate-bearing residue found in all prior 2OG oxyge-nase structures was substituted by an Ala in SyrB2 apparently leaving sufficient space for a chloride ion to fill the vacant iron coordination site. Four 2OGoxygenases are known to be involved in regulation of the hypoxic response in humans via the post-translational hydroxylation of specific residues in the None-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF): three prolyl hydroxylases (9, 10) and an asparagine hydroxylase (FIH, factor inhibiting HIF (11\u201313)). Hydroxylation of specific proline residues signals for the pro-teolytic destruction of HIF-None (9, 10), whereas hydroxylation of an asparagine residue (Asn-803 in human HIF-1None) (Fig. 1) in the C-terminal transactivation domain blocks recruitment of * This work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust, the Engineer-ing and Physical Sciences Research Council, and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council for funding.

SEPTEMBER 19, 2008 \u2022 VOLUME 283 \u2022 NUMBER 38 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 25971 This is an Open Access article under theCC BY the p300/CREB-binding protein co-activators (11\u201313) (for review, see Refs. 14 and 15). Studies on the iron cofactor binding residues of FIH have sup-ported the assignment of FIH as a 2OG oxygenase and enabled identification of the iron binding residues as His-199, Asp-201, and His-279. Lando et al. (12) demonstrated that substitution of either His-199 or Asp-201 to alanine residues ablated FIH activity in cells.Crystallographic analyses confirmed the assignmentof the iron binding residues (16\u201318). A structure of dimeric FIH in com-plex with Fe(II), 2OG, and HIF-1None786\u2013826 revealed that the side-chaincarboxylateofFIHAsp-201notonly coordinates the ironvia one oxygen, but that its other oxygen is positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from an Fe(II)-bound water molecule; upon sub-strate binding, the interaction of thewater is apparentlyweakened becauseAsp-201 is repositioned to formahydrogenbondwith the backbone amide nitrogen of HIF-1None Asn-803 as observed in the crystal structures (Fig. 2) (17). We report here that although FIH-D201A and FIH-D201E do not catalyze HIF-1None hydroxylation, under appropriate con-ditions, these enzymes do catalyze enhanced 2OG turnover when compared with the wild-type FIH. Surprisingly, the FIH-D201G mutant catalyzes asparaginyl hydroxylation at compa-rable levels to wild-type FIH. Crystal structures of FIH-D201ANoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 and D201GNoneZn(II)None2OGNone HIF-1None788\u2013806 reveal that the only FIH-based ligands required to bind iron are His-199 and His-279. Together with the recent studies on 2OG halogenases (6, 7) and spectroscopic analyses (4), our results indicate that there is more flexibility in the iron coor-dination chemistry of 2OG oxygenases than previously thought. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES FIH Mutations\u2014The FIH-D201A/E/G, W296R, and L340R variants were produced from the wild-type construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers used were: D201A, forward, 5None-GCT CAC TAT GCT GAG CAG CAG AAC-3None; reverse, 5None-CTG CTG CTC AGC ATA GTG AGC AGG-3None; D201E, forward, 5None-GCT CAC TAT GAG GAG CAG CAG AAC-3None; reverse, 5None-CTG CTG CTC CTCATAGTGAGCAGG-3None; D201G, forward, 5None-GTGACA CCT GCT CAC TAT GGC GAG CAG CAG AAC-3None; reverse, 5None-GTT CTG CTG CTC GCC ATA GTG AGC AGG TGT CAC-3None; W296R, forward, 5None-C ATC ACT GTG AAC TTC CGGTATAAGGGGGCTC-3None; reverse, 5None-GAGCCCCCTT ATA CCG GAA GTT CAC AGT GAT G-3None; L340R, forward, 5None-GTG GGG CCC TTG AGG AAC ACA ATG ATC AAG GGC-3None; reverse, 5None-GCC CTT GAT CAT TGT GTT CCT CAAGGGCCCCAC-3None. Bold codons indicate the site ofmuta-tion. The integrity of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Production\u2014Wild-type FIH, FIHmutants, and GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826 were purified as described (11). Protein purity (None95%) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Radiochemical Assays\u2014Enzyme assays measured the release of [14C]CO2 from1-[14C]2OG (11). FIH variants (11.5NoneM)were incubated with HIF-1None786\u2013826 (57.5 NoneM) in the presence of 80 NoneM Fe(II), 160 NoneM 2OG, 4 mM ascorbate, and 1 mM dithiothre-itol (DTT) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The final reaction volume was 100 Nonel. Under these conditions, None50% of the HIF-1None substrate is hydroxylated by wild-type FIH. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 200 Nonel of methanol followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. Ascorbate analogs or alternative substrates (Sigma-Aldrich) were dis-solved in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) and tested in the 1-[14C]2OG decarboxylation assay as reported above. For time course data, reactions were stopped at specific time points by quenching as described above. Assays monitoring oxygen depletion were carried out as described (19). Hydroxylation Assays Using MALDI MS HIF\u20141None788\u2013806 peptide substrate was obtained from Peptide Protein Research Ltd. (Fareham, UK). Reactions were carried out using the same conditions as for the radiochemical assays, except unlabeled 2OG was used and the final 2OG (500 NoneM) and Fe(II) (400 NoneM) concentrations were increased. Incubations in the presence of sodium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium acetate, sodium propionate, or sodium azide (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200 mM) were carried out. After incubation (30min), trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% final concentration) was added, and the reaction mixture was diluted five times with double distilled water. ForMS anal-yses, the quenched reaction mixtures (1 Nonel) were mixed with None-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (1 Nonel) and spotted onto a tar-get plate. MALDI-time-of-flight spectra in the negative ion mode were then recorded for each sample. Crystallography\u2014The crystallization conditions for both FIH-D201A and FIH-D201G were similar to those described for wild-type FIH (17). The variants were crystallized (in a Belle Laboratories glove box under anaerobic conditions for FIH-D201A and aerobic conditions for FIH-D201G) by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 \u00b0C using 2-Nonel drops (1 Nonel of protein solution:1 Nonel of well solution) against a well solution of 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.6 M (NH4)2SO4, and 6% polyethylene glycol 400. The FIH-D201A or FIH-D201G protein solution con-tained 14 or 25mg/ml, respectively, in 50mMTris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 mM HIF-1None786\u2013826 or 0.5 mM HIF-1None788\u2013806 peptide, 1 mM FeSO4, or ZnCl2 and 2 mM 2OG (added under anaerobic conditions for FIH-D201A). Crystals were fully grown within 8 days. The crystals were removed from the glove box, trans-ferred into a well solution containing 24% glycerol that was prepared in the glove box and immediately retrieved using a nylon loop, frozen by rapid plunging into liquid nitrogen, and stored under liquid nitrogen until data collection. The entire process of removing the crystals from the glove box through FIGURE 1. The reaction catalyzed by wild-type FIH (and FIH-D201G). freezing took less than 5min tomin-imize the diffusion of oxygen into the crystal-containing solution. Crystal-containing loops were mounted on a goniometer in a cryo-stream at 100 K. For FIH-D201A, 153 images of 1\u00b0 oscilla-tion, 15 s per image with a crystal to detector distance of 275 mm, were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) BM14 tuned to wavelength of 0.95372 \u00c5 using a MarMosiaic 225 CCD detector. For FIH-D201G, 360 images of 0.5\u00b0 oscilla-tion, 1 s per image, and a crystal to detector distance of 294 mm were used. Data were collected at Dia-mond I04 tuned to a wavelength of 0.9696 \u00c5 using an ADSCQuantum 315 CCD detector. Data were pro-cessed using HKL2000 (20) (sup-plemental Table S1). To follow the refinement pro-gress, a subset of 5% of the data was withheld from refinement throughout to obtain an Rfree value. The coordinates from PDB entry 1H2N (17) were used as the starting model for one cycle of rigid body refinement followed by cycles of maximum likelihood-simulated annealing with bulk sol-vent correction using CNS version 1.1 (21) and model rebuilding using COOT version 0.26 (22) until convergence of R and Rfree. Water molecules were placed based on 2Fo None Fc electron density peaks that were within hydrogen-bonding distance of protein donors or accep-tors. The structure was analyzed for problem areas between refinement cycles using PROCHECK (23) and WHATIF (24). The structures have been deposited in the Research Col-laboratory for Structural Bioinfor-matics (RCSB) PDB as PDB IDs 2ILM (FIH-D201A) and 3D8C (FIH-D201G). RESULTS Biochemical Characterization of FIH D201A\u2014Consistent with the previous cell-based results (12), purified FIH-D201A did not cata-lyze hydroxylation of HIF peptide substrate (HIF-1None788\u2013806) in vitro, FIGURE 2. Insights from crystal structures of FIH-D201A and FIH-D201G. a, stereo view of the iron binding as demonstrated by MS analyses (Fig. 3). However, using an assay in which the amount of [14C]CO2 produced from 1-[14C]2OG is used to measure activity, significant stimulation of 2OG turnover by the FIH-D201Avariantwas observed under standard assay conditions in the presence of ascorbate (supple-mental Fig. S1). For FIH-D201A, the extent of 2OG decarbox-ylation was greater than for wild-type FIH, with all of the 2OG in the reaction mixture being consumed in the FIH-D201A assay. Under the same conditions, wild-type FIH catalyzed hydroxylation ofNone50% of theHIF-1None substrate and decarboxy-lated only None15% of the 2OG present (Fig. 4). Attempts to restore the wild-type hydroxylase activity with the FIH-D201A mutant by the use of small molecules (formate, acetate, propi-onate, carbonate, and azide) in assays with HIF-1None788\u2013806 were unsuccessful (supplemental Fig. S3). Ascorbate andHIF-1NoneDependence\u2014Ascorbate has relatively little effect onwild-type FIH activity. Unexpectedly, when using HIF-1None786\u2013826 as a substrate for FIH-D201A, it was found that the addition of L-ascorbate was a requirement for enhanced 2OG turnover, stimulating activity None10-fold. Furthermore, the 2OG turnover activity of FIH-D201A was reduced (None10-fold) in the absence ofHIF-1None786\u2013826 substrate, implying that both ascor-bate and HIF-1None786\u2013826 substrate are required for efficient 2OG decarboxylation (Fig. 4) despite the absence of HIF-1None788\u2013806 hydroxylation. For both wild-type FIH and FIH-D201A, activity was reduced in the absence of added Fe(II). Substrate Mutations\u2014The relative importance of HIF-1None Asn-803, the normally hydroxylated residue, to FIH activity has been reported (25). FIH does not stimulate 2OG turnover (None0.1%ofwild-typeGST-HIF-1None786\u2013826) in the presence of the GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826-N803A, -N803E, and -N803Q variants. The GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826-N803D variant resulted in only None7% 2OG turnover when compared with that of WT-GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826 with FIH (11). The effects of the same GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826 variants on FIH-D201A activity were investigated; they all stimulated 2OG turnover to approximately the same level: N803A (18% of wild-type GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826 activity observed), N803D (20%), N803E (17%), and N803Q (16%). Dimerization Dependence\u2014The FIH-L340R substitution has been shown to convert the FIH homodimer into a predomi-nantly monomeric form that shows None20% of the wild-type FIH 2OG turnover activity but is inactive with respect to HIF hydroxylation (26). To investigate whether the homodimeric form of FIH-D201Awas required for the uncoupled 2OG turn-over, the double mutant FIH-D201A/L340R was prepared and analyzed. FIH-D201A/L340R did not stimulate 2OG turnover in the presence of L-ascorbate and/or HIF-1None, indicating that, as for wild-type FIH, the homodimeric form of FIH-D201A is required for catalysis (Fig. 4). Ascorbate Analogs\u2014To investigate the specificity of FIH-D201A for ascorbate, ascorbate analogs were tested using the [14C]2OG decarboxylation assay. D-Isoascorbate gave None75% FIGURE 3. Negative ion MALDI-time-of-flight analysis of 19-mer HIF-1None C-terminal transactivation domain peptide (HIF-1None788 (None5% error) of the activity of L-ascorbate for FIH-D201A. L-Galactonic acid-None-lactone, L-gulonic-None-lactone, and L-man-nonic acid-None-lactone all stimulated 2OG turnover by only None5% of the level observed for L-ascorbate with FIH-D201A; these results indicate the importance of the dienol moiety of ascor-bate. Interestingly, isopropylidene-L-ascorbic acid stimulated FIH-D201A activity to the same level as L-ascorbate, but (None)-5,6-O-cyclohexylidene-L-ascorbic acid to onlyNone8%, suggesting a steric constraint on ascorbate-dependent oxidation. Further evidence for the selectivity of reducing agent came from the observation that DTT effectively substituted for L-ascorbate (None95% activity), but dithionite, None-mercaptoetha-nol, and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride all stimulated activity to less than 10% (None3, 9, and None1%, respec-tively) of that observed for L-ascorbate and DTT. Since phenol and its derivatives have been used both as alternative substrates and as competitive inhibitors of the copper-dependent ascor-bate oxidase (27), phenol and selected phenolic derivatives (4-chlorophenol, 4-nirophenol, 4-cyanophenol, 4-tertbutyl-phenol, 4-methylphenol, 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, 4-nitrocat-echol) were tested both as ascorbate substitutes and as inhibi-tors of FIH-D201A. None of the phenolic compounds could replace ascorbate as stimulators of FIH-D201A activity or were found to be potent inhibitors. FIH-D201E\u2014Given that the structurally characterized 2OG-dependent dioxygenases (JMJD2A and clavaminic acid syn-thase) have a glutamic acid residue functioning as the carboxy-late iron binding ligand (28, 29), the FIH-D201E variant was investigated. The FIH-D201E had low 2OG turnover activity in the absence of ascorbate, and MS analyses showed that this mutant did not support HIF-1None788\u2013806 hydroxylation. How-ever, FIH-D201E did catalyze the turnover of 2OG (to a lesser extent than FIH-D201A), which was stimulated by the addition of L-ascorbate and GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826 (Fig. 4). FIH-D201G and FIH-D201G/ W296R\u2014To further probe the role of the carboxylate residue of the facial triad in FIH, a glycyl residue was substituted for Asp-201. The FIH-D201G mutant behaved similarly to FIH-D201A in that 2OG decarboxylationwas highly depend-ent on the presence of L-ascorbate. 2OG turnover by FIH-D201G was less dependent on GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826 when compared with FIH-D201A (Fig. 4). An unantici-pated result was that, in contrast to FIH-D201A and FIH-D201E, FIH-D201G supported HIF-1None788\u2013806 hydroxylation (as shown by MS assays) at levels comparable with wild-type FIH (Fig. 3). A FIH-D201G/W296R double variant was also generated because an arginine occupies the equivalent position as the FIH Trp-296 at the active site of the SyrB2 2OG-dependent haloge-nase (8). Catalysis of HIF-1None788\u2013806 hydroxylation by the dou-ble variant was not detected by MS analyses (Fig. 3), possibly because the substitution of the hydrophobic tryptophan with a polar/charged arginine probably disrupts the interaction with Val-802 of HIF1None (17). For the double variant, 2OG decarbox-ylation was observed, but to a lesser extent than that observed with the D201A variant. 2OG turnover was highly dependent on the presence of L-ascorbate but was less dependent on the presence of HIF-1None786\u2013826 when compared with D201A (Fig. 4). As for FIH-D201A and FIH-D201G, activity of FIH-D201G/ W296R was stimulated by the addition of Fe(II). Crystal Structures of FIH-D201A and FIH-D201G in Com-plex with HIF-1None Substrate\u2014To examine the mode of metal coordination in FIH-D201A and FIH-D201G, crystallographic analyses were performed. Attempts to crystallize the D201E mutant failed, so modeling of this variant was carried out (sup-plemental Fig. S2). FIH-D201A crystals were grown in the presence of Fe(II), 2OG, and HIF-1None786\u2013826 under anaerobic conditions by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Synchrotron data were collected to 2.3 \u00c5 resolution and refined to a final Rfactor of 21.0% andRfree of 26.7%. FIH-D201G crystals were grown in the presence of Zn(II), 2OG, and HIF-1None788\u2013806 by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Synchrotron data were collected to 2.1\u00c5 resolution and refined to a finalRfactor of 21.8% andRfree of 25.6%. Overall, the structures of the FIH mutants in complex with HIF-1None are very similar to that of the wild-type FIHNoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 complex (PBD ID 1H2L (17)) (Fig. 2, a and b). However, there are significant differences with respect to the binding of HIF-1None substrate. In contrast to the wild-type structure, which shows HIF-1None residues binding at two sites, residues 795\u2013806 (site 1 as defined in Elkins et al. (17)) and 813\u2013822 (site 2), only HIF-1None residues 794\u2013799 FIGURE 4. 1-[14C]2OG from site 1 are observed in the FIH-D201ANoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 complex, and HIF-1None residues 794\u2013806 from site 1 are observed in the FIH-D201GNoneZn(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None788\u2013806 complex (Fig. 2d). In both FIH-D201 variant structures, the active site metal is coordinated by only two enzyme-derived residues (His-199 and His-279) that adopt near identical conformations to those in the wild-type FIH structures. The main-chain atoms of residue 201 overlay with those of the wild-type structure (Fig. 2, a and b). In both variant structures, the 2OG is coordinated to the Fe(II) in a similar manner to wild-type FIH with its 1-carboxy-late group binding trans toHis-199.However, the electron den-sity map of the FIH-D201ANoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 struc-ture indicated an additional planar metal ligand, possibly comprised of four atoms bound to Fe(II) in a bidentate manner that apparently distorts the typical octahedral metal coordina-tion geometry. This apparent ligand, provisionally assigned as a carbonate or bicarbonate ion, is possibly derived from CO2, generated by 2OG (30), but other possibilities including acetate or aHIF-1None-derived species cannot be ruled out.One of the two assigned Fe(II)-ligated oxygen atoms of the (bi)carbonate approximately bisects the position of the two carboxylate oxy-gens of Asp-201 in wild-type FIH and has an apparently longer coordination bond length (2.5 \u00c5) than the other Fe(II)-coordi-nating atoms (None 2.4 \u00c5). In the FIH-D201ANoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 structure, there was reasonable occupancy for residues 794\u2013799 of HIF-1None in site 1, and comparison with the wild-type FIHNoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 complex reveals that this region of the HIF-1None peptide adopts a similar conformation in both structures (Fig. 2d). This region of HIF-1None binds close to the FIH dimer interface formed by the two C-terminal helices (26). However, HIF-1None residues (800\u2013806 in PDB ID1H2L) near the iron binding site in the FIH-D201ANoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 structure are probably disordered, as observed by broken resid-ual difference density that did not refine well, even when defined with a low occupancy. To investigate why the FIH-D210G but not the FIH-D201A can catalyze hydroxylation, a crystal structure was also obtained for the FIH-D210GNoneZn(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None788\u2013806 com-plex (Fig. 2d). In contrast to the FIH-D201ANoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 structure, the FIH-D201G structure reveals the HIF-1None788\u2013806 substrate positioned similarly to that of the WT-FIHNoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 complex in site 1 (Fig. 2d), such that Asn-803 is adjacent to the active site metal (Zn(II) substituting for Fe(II)). Overall, the crystallographic results imply that only two enzyme-derived iron-coordinating ligands are required for 2OG turnover and hydroxylation. Although it is possible that the differences may result from crystallographic artifacts, the different binding modes observed for HIF-1None786\u2013826 in the FIH-D201A and the WT FIH/FIH-D201G correlate with the lack of hydroxylation activity observed for FIH-D201A. The non-productive binding of HIF-1None786\u2013826 in FIH-D201A crystals may be related to the apparent metal ligand observed for this variant because it is in position to interfere with substrate binding. DISCUSSION Althoughwe cannot entirely exclude the possibility of a rear-rangement in solution to provide a third protein based Fe(II) ligand, the biochemical and crystallographic results presented here provide evidence that only two His-residues are required for FIH-D201A/G to bind iron and 2OG to catalyze the oxida-tive decarboxylation of 2OG to succinate and carbon dioxide. In contrast to the wild-type and FIH-D201G HIF substrate complex structures, density for HIF-1None Asn-803 and the sur-rounding residues (800\u2013806) was not observed adjacent to the iron center in the FIH-D201A substrate complex. Although we cannot be certain that this reflects the situation in solution, the presence of amethyl side chain at FIH residue-201must hinder productive binding. The difference in the hydroxylation activity between the FIH-D201A and FIH-D201G cannot solely result from steric effects because in wild-type FIH residue-201 is an aspartate. It is possible that the presence of a glycine, rather than an alanine residue, enables complexation of a water mol-ecule to the iron that can hydrogen-bond toHIF-1NoneAsn-803 in a analogous manner to that observed for Asp-201 in the wild-type FIH-HIF structural complex. The FIH-D201A mutant resembles the SyrB2 2OG-depend-ent chlorinating enzyme, of which the iron is also coordinated by two His-residues with an Ala residue in a similar position as residue 201 in FIH (7). During catalysis by SyrB2, a halide ion replaces the iron coordination site occupied by the side-chain carboxylate of Asp-201 in FIH (Fig. 2c) (8). Attempted chlori-nation of the HIF-1None substrate by FIH-D201A in assays supple-mented with sodium chloride was unsuccessful. Structural comparison of FIH-D201Awith SyrB2 suggests that thismay in part be due to a lack of space for the chloride ion to coordinate Fe(II) (Fig. 2c). Although our attempted halogenation experi-ments were negative, the knowledge that FIH-D201G only requires two enzyme-derived iron ligands opens the way for studies aimed at further modifying FIH to enable the halogen-ation of unactivated C\u2013H bonds in proteins. In light of the discovery of the 2OG chlorinating enzymes (7, 8) and the results described here for the FIH-D201A mutant, consideration should be given to the possibility of an Fe(II)-coordinating \u201ctwo-histidine dyad\u201d in searches for 2OG oxyge-nases in bioinformatic-based approaches. Other variants of the facial triad may also exist; modeling of the JmjC domain of the fission yeast protein Epe1, thought to be a 2OG-dependent hy-droxylase (31), using an alignment with FIH, indicates that the second His residue of the facial triad is replaced by Tyr (32). Thus the predicted iron-coordinating residues in Epe1 are His, Glu, and Tyr (HXE . . . Y). Sequence analyses also imply that the HX(D/E) . . . H facial triad may not be conserved in other 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, including the epidermal growth fac-tor aspartyl/asparaginyl hydroxylase (33). The FIH-D201A/E variants do not catalyze HIF-1None aspar-aginyl hydroxylation, but do catalyze decarboxylation of 2OG, and at a higher rate than that observed for the wild-type FIH. However, unlike the hydroxylation reaction cata-lyzed by wild-type FIH with HIF-1None C-terminal transactiva-tion domain, the oxidation of 2OG by both FIH-D201G/A mutants was very dependent on the presence of a reducing FIH D201X Mutants 25976 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 283 \u2022 NUMBER 38 \u2022 SEPTEMBER 19, 2008 agent, such as ascorbate or DTT. In the case of FIH-D201G, 2OG turnover was coupled, at least partially, to substrate hydroxylation. However, in contrast to wild-type FIH, for FIH-D201G, both 2OG decarboxylation in the absence of substrate and HIF substrate hydroxylation were ascorbate-dependent. This dependence resembles that of some other 2OG oxygenases (see e.g. Refs. 34 and 35), including collagen prolyl hydroxylase, the activity of which is well known to be stimulated by ascorbate. It is reasonable to propose that the first part of the catalytic cycles for both the wild-type FIH and the FIH-D201X mutants is common, i.e. 2OG is oxidized to produce succinate, carbon dioxide, and an Fe(VI)NoneO intermediate (36, 37). Because HIF-1None is not hydroxylated by the FIH-D201A/E mutants, regeneration of Fe(II) from the higher oxidation state interme-diates is required to complete their catalytic cycle. The require-ment for a reducing agent may in part rationalize the increased dependence of these FIH variants on ascorbate when compared withWT FIH. It is also possible that, in addition to completing some catalytic cycles, ascorbate affects the reactivity of inter-mediate complexes. Substitutions of iron binding residues or other active site residues of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases have been reported (38, 39) to (partially) decouple 2OG and prime sub-strate oxidation. However, the increased 2OG turnover by the D201A/E/G variants of FIH is unusual. In FIH, Asp-201 is proposed to play a role both in binding iron and in accept-ing a hydrogen bond from HIF Asn-803, the substrate resi-due that is hydroxylated. A third possible role for Asp-201 is in hindering binding of oxygen prior to that of HIF substrate. The non-iron-ligating side-chain carboxylate oxygen may stabilize binding of a water molecule to the five coordinate FIHNoneFeNone2OG complex, giving a relatively stable six-coordi-nate complex (as proposed for other 2OG oxygenases (4)). On substrate binding, a five-coordinate complex is formed that can react with oxygen and in which the non-ligating oxygen of Asp-201 hydrogen bonds with Asn-803 of HIF. This mecha-nism could prevent FIH-mediated non-productive 2OG turn-over when HIF substrate is not available. Substitutions of FIH Asp-201 may result in a weakened interaction between the water molecule and Fe(II) in the FIH-D201A/ENoneFe(II)None2OG complexes, making reactionwith oxygen easier and causing the high levels of 2OG turnover observed for these variants in the absence of HIF. Significantly, despite the fact the methyl side chain of Ala-201 can neither covalently bind the iron nor hydrogen-bond to the substrate, the 2OG turnover activity of FIH-D201A was stimulated by the presence of HIF-1None786\u2013826. Since the HIF-1None786\u2013826 was not itself hydroxylated by FIH-D201A, the results imply that the oxidation of 2OG is catalyzed by a hybrid complex comprised of FIH-D201A and HIF-1None786\u2013826. It is possible that the selectivity of this hybrid complex could be engineered by synthetic modifications to the HIF-1None786\u2013826 component. The HIF-1None786\u2013826-stimulating effect was seen to a much lesser extent with the D201E FIH mutant, possibly because thismutant can still bind iron via a triad of FIH-derived residues; the larger glutamyl side chain may also limit space available for substrate (peptide or ascorbate) binding. The increased 2OG turnover activity observed for FIH-D201A in the presence of HIF-1None786\u2013826 substrate may in part be because the HIF-1None substrate modifies the FIH active site to strengthen Fe(II) binding. However, the structural studies sug-gest that such an effect may be more complicated than strengthening of iron binding via a direct complexation. Although the detailed mechanism by which HIF-1None peptides stimulate 2OG turnover by FIH-D201A is complicated, the available evidence implies that it may also include binding interactions away from the immediate vicinity of the Fe(II) including those at, or close to, the dimer interface.

        "A 2-His-1-carboxylate triad of iron binding residues is pres-ent in many non-heme iron oxygenases including the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenases. Three variants (D201A, D201E, and D201G) of the iron binding Asp-201 resi-due of an asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), were made and analyzed. FIH-D201A and FIH-D201E did not catalyze asparaginyl hydroxylation, but in the presence of a reducing agent, they displayed enhanced 2OG turnover when compared with wild-type FIH. Turnover of 2OG by FIH-D201A was significantly stimulated by the addition of HIF-1None786\u2013826 peptide. Like FIH-D201A and D201E, the D201G variant enhanced 2OG turnover but rather unexpectedly catalyzed asparaginyl hydroxylation. Crystal structures of the FIH-D201A and D201G variants in complex with Fe(II)/Zn(II), 2OG, and HIF-1None786\u2013826/788\u2013806 implied that only two FIH-based resi-dues (His-199 and His-279) are required for metal binding. The results indicate that variation of 2OG-dependent dioxygenase iron-ligating residues as a means of functional assignment should be treated with caution. The results are of mechanistic interest in the light of recent biochemical and structural analy-ses of non-heme iron and 2OG-dependent halogenases that are similar to the FIH-D201A/G variants in that they use only two His-residues to ligate iron.",
        "The 2-His-1-carboxylate iron binding triad (HX(D/E) . . . H) is an extensively conserved feature of the active site of the non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases and oxidases, including the 2OG6-dependent dioxygenase family (2OG oxygenases). Crys-tallographic and spectroscopic studies imply that the enzymeNoneFeNone2OG intermediate has an octahedral metal coordi-nation, with three of the coordination sites occupied by the 2-oxo-acid of 2OG and a water molecule. In some cases, bind-ing of substrate to this complex has been shown to induce loss of the iron bound water so enabling dioxygen binding. Oxida-tive decarboxylation of 2OG results in the formation of a ferryl species (Fe(VI)NoneO) that effects oxidation of the substrate/co-substrate with the regeneration of Fe(II) at the active site (for review, see Refs. 1\u20133). In addition, spectroscopic studies have demonstrated that interaction of the non-iron-ligated oxygen atomof the carboxylate side chain of themetal bindingAsp/Glu residuewith the iron boundwatermolecule has a role in oxygen activation (4).",
        "Hydroxylation is themost common reaction catalyzed by the 2OG oxygenases, but family members also catalyze other oxi-dative reactions including demethylations, desaturations, epoxidations, and rearrangements. Related enzymes, which do not employ 2OG as a co-substrate, have been shown to catalyze oxidative fragmentations and cyclization reactions (for review, see Refs. 2 and 5). Recently, two 2OG oxygenases have been reported to catalyze oxidative halogenations (6, 7); the struc-ture of one of these halogenases, SyrB2, revealed that the iron was coordinated by only two enzyme-derived His residues (8). The carboxylate-bearing residue found in all prior 2OG oxyge-nase structures was substituted by an Ala in SyrB2 apparently leaving sufficient space for a chloride ion to fill the vacant iron coordination site.",

Hydroxylation of specific proline residues signals for the pro-teolytic destruction of HIF-None (9, 10), whereas hydroxylation of an asparagine residue (Asn-803 in human HIF-1None) (Fig. 1) in the C-terminal transactivation domain blocks recruitment of",

Lando et al.

To investigate whether the homodimeric form of FIH-D201Awas required for the uncoupled 2OG turn-over, the double mutant FIH-D201A/L340R was prepared and analyzed. FIH-D201A/L340R did not stimulate 2OG turnover in the presence of L-ascorbate and/or HIF-1None, indicating that, as for wild-type FIH, the homodimeric form of FIH-D201A is required for catalysis (Fig. 4).",

The FIH-D201E had low 2OG turnover activity in the absence of ascorbate, and MS analyses showed that this mutant did not support HIF-1None788\u2013806 hydroxylation. How-ever, FIH-D201E did catalyze the turnover of 2OG (to a lesser extent than FIH-D201A), which was stimulated by the addition of L-ascorbate and GST-HIF-1None786\u2013826 (Fig. 4).",

The main-chain atoms of residue 201 overlay with those of the wild-type structure (Fig. 2, a and b). In both variant structures, the 2OG is coordinated to the Fe(II) in a similar manner to wild-type FIH with its 1-carboxy-late group binding trans toHis-199.However, the electron den-sity map of the FIH-D201ANoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 struc-ture indicated an additional planar metal ligand, possibly comprised of four atoms bound to Fe(II) in a bidentate manner that apparently distorts the typical octahedral metal coordina-tion geometry. This apparent ligand, provisionally assigned as a carbonate or bicarbonate ion, is possibly derived from CO2, generated by 2OG (30), but other possibilities including acetate or aHIF-1None-derived species cannot be ruled out.One of the two assigned Fe(II)-ligated oxygen atoms of the (bi)carbonate approximately bisects the position of the two carboxylate oxy-gens of Asp-201 in wild-type FIH and has an apparently longer coordination bond length (2.5 \u00c5) than the other Fe(II)-coordi-nating atoms (None 2.4 \u00c5).",

This region of HIF-1None binds close to the FIH dimer interface formed by the two C-terminal helices (26). However, HIF-1None residues (800\u2013806 in PDB ID1H2L) near the iron binding site in the FIH-D201ANoneFe(II)None2OGNoneHIF-1None786\u2013826 structure are probably disordered, as observed by broken resid-ual difference density that did not refine well, even when defined with a low occupancy.",

Although it is possible that the differences may result from crystallographic artifacts, the different binding modes observed for HIF-1None786\u2013826 in the FIH-D201A and the WT FIH/FIH-D201G correlate with the lack of hydroxylation activity observed for FIH-D201A. The non-productive binding of HIF-1None786\u2013826 in FIH-D201A crystals may be related to the apparent metal ligand observed for this variant because it is in position to interfere with substrate binding. DISCUSSION",
        "Althoughwe cannot entirely exclude the possibility of a rear-rangement in solution to provide a third protein based Fe(II) ligand, the biochemical and crystallographic results presented here provide evidence that only two His-residues are required for FIH-D201A/G to bind iron and 2OG to catalyze the oxida-tive decarboxylation of 2OG to succinate and carbon dioxide.",
        "In contrast to the wild-type and FIH-D201G HIF substrate complex structures, density for HIF-1None Asn-803 and the sur-rounding residues (800\u2013806) was not observed adjacent to the iron center in the FIH-D201A substrate complex. Although we cannot be certain that this reflects the situation in solution, the presence of amethyl side chain at FIH residue-201must hinder productive binding. The difference in the hydroxylation activity between the FIH-D201A and FIH-D201G cannot solely result from steric effects because in wild-type FIH residue-201 is an aspartate. It is possible that the presence of a glycine, rather than an alanine residue, enables complexation of a water mol-ecule to the iron that can hydrogen-bond toHIF-1NoneAsn-803 in a analogous manner to that observed for Asp-201 in the wild-type FIH-HIF structural complex.",
        "The FIH-D201A mutant resembles the SyrB2 2OG-depend-ent chlorinating enzyme, of which the iron is also coordinated by two His-residues with an Ala residue in a similar position as residue 201 in FIH (7). During catalysis by SyrB2, a halide ion replaces the iron coordination site occupied by the side-chain carboxylate of Asp-201 in FIH (Fig. 2c) (8). Attempted chlori-nation of the HIF-1None substrate by FIH-D201A in assays supple-mented with sodium chloride was unsuccessful. Structural comparison of FIH-D201Awith SyrB2 suggests that thismay in part be due to a lack of space for the chloride ion to coordinate Fe(II) (Fig. 2c). Although our attempted halogenation experi-ments were negative, the knowledge that FIH-D201G only requires two enzyme-derived iron ligands opens the way for studies aimed at further modifying FIH to enable the halogen-ation of unactivated C\u2013H bonds in proteins.",
        "In light of the discovery of the 2OG chlorinating enzymes (7, 8) and the results described here for the FIH-D201A mutant, consideration should be given to the possibility of an Fe(II)-coordinating \u201ctwo-histidine dyad\u201d in searches for 2OG oxyge-nases in bioinformatic-based approaches. Other variants of the facial triad may also exist; modeling of the JmjC domain of the fission yeast protein Epe1, thought to be a 2OG-dependent hy-droxylase (31), using an alignment with FIH, indicates that the second His residue of the facial triad is replaced by Tyr (32). Thus the predicted iron-coordinating residues in Epe1 are His, Glu, and Tyr (HXE . . . Y). Sequence analyses also imply that the HX(D/E) . . . H facial triad may not be conserved in other 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, including the epidermal growth fac-tor aspartyl/asparaginyl hydroxylase (33).",

        "agent, such as ascorbate or DTT. In the case of FIH-D201G, 2OG turnover was coupled, at least partially, to substrate hydroxylation. However, in contrast to wild-type FIH, for FIH-D201G, both 2OG decarboxylation in the absence of substrate and HIF substrate hydroxylation were ascorbate-dependent. This dependence resembles that of some other 2OG oxygenases (see e.g. Refs. 34 and 35), including collagen prolyl hydroxylase, the activity of which is well known to be stimulated by ascorbate.",
        "It is reasonable to propose that the first part of the catalytic cycles for both the wild-type FIH and the FIH-D201X mutants is common, i.e. 2OG is oxidized to produce succinate, carbon dioxide, and an Fe(VI)NoneO intermediate (36, 37). Because HIF-1None is not hydroxylated by the FIH-D201A/E mutants, regeneration of Fe(II) from the higher oxidation state interme-diates is required to complete their catalytic cycle. The require-ment for a reducing agent may in part rationalize the increased dependence of these FIH variants on ascorbate when compared withWT FIH. It is also possible that, in addition to completing some catalytic cycles, ascorbate affects the reactivity of inter-mediate complexes.",
        "Substitutions of iron binding residues or other active site residues of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases have been reported (38, 39) to (partially) decouple 2OG and prime sub-strate oxidation. However, the increased 2OG turnover by the D201A/E/G variants of FIH is unusual. In FIH, Asp-201 is proposed to play a role both in binding iron and in accept-ing a hydrogen bond from HIF Asn-803, the substrate resi-due that is hydroxylated. A third possible role for Asp-201 is in hindering binding of oxygen prior to that of HIF substrate. The non-iron-ligating side-chain carboxylate oxygen may stabilize binding of a water molecule to the five coordinate FIHNoneFeNone2OG complex, giving a relatively stable six-coordi-nate complex (as proposed for other 2OG oxygenases (4)). On substrate binding, a five-coordinate complex is formed that can react with oxygen and in which the non-ligating oxygen of Asp-201 hydrogen bonds with Asn-803 of HIF. This mecha-nism could prevent FIH-mediated non-productive 2OG turn-over when HIF substrate is not available. Substitutions of FIH Asp-201 may result in a weakened interaction between the water molecule and Fe(II) in the FIH-D201A/ENoneFe(II)None2OG complexes, making reactionwith oxygen easier and causing the high levels of 2OG turnover observed for these variants in the absence of HIF.",
        "Significantly, despite the fact the methyl side chain of Ala-201 can neither covalently bind the iron nor hydrogen-bond to the substrate, the 2OG turnover activity of FIH-D201A was stimulated by the presence of HIF-1None786\u2013826. Since the HIF-1None786\u2013826 was not itself hydroxylated by FIH-D201A, the results imply that the oxidation of 2OG is catalyzed by a hybrid complex comprised of FIH-D201A and HIF-1None786\u2013826. It is possible that the selectivity of this hybrid complex could be engineered by synthetic modifications to the HIF-1None786\u2013826 component. The HIF-1None786\u2013826-stimulating effect was seen to a much lesser extent with the D201E FIH mutant, possibly because thismutant can still bind iron via a triad of FIH-derived residues; the larger glutamyl side chain may also limit space available for substrate (peptide or ascorbate) binding.",
        "The increased 2OG turnover activity observed for FIH-D201A in the presence of HIF-1None786\u2013826 substrate may in part be because the HIF-1None substrate modifies the FIH active site to strengthen Fe(II) binding. However, the structural studies sug-gest that such an effect may be more complicated than strengthening of iron binding via a direct complexation. Although the detailed mechanism by which HIF-1None peptides stimulate 2OG turnover by FIH-D201A is complicated, the available evidence implies that it may also include binding interactions away from the immediate vicinity of the Fe(II) including those at, or close to, the dimer interface.
