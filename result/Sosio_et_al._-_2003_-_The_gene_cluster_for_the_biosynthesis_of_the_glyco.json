ORFs 1 and 2 (Table 1) show considerable sequence identity to Hmo and p-hydroxy-mandelate synthetase (HmaS), respectively, which are required to convert p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate into p-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate during HPG synthesis [8, 12]. ORFs 31 to 34 are closely related to DpgA through DpgD, respectively (Table 1), which are required for DPG formation [10, 16]. dbv ORF37 encodes a homolog of HpgT, the amino transferase required for the transami-nation of both p-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate and 3,5-dihy-droxyphenylglyoxylate, to yield HPG and DPG, respec-tively [8, 16]. Thus, the seven genes required for HPG and DPG synthesis are also present in the dbv cluster. dbv ORF5, which encodes a homolog of prephenate dehydro-genase, may also participate in HPG synthesis. This func-tion is likely to provide the initial p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate for HPG synthesis. Since HpgT uses Tyr preferentially asFigure 1.

Two internal SacI fragments, for a total of 2.8 kb, were then replaced with the tsr gene, PCR amplified from pIJ39 [42]. Then, the resulting 5.4 kb insert was excised as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment and cloned into the corresponding sites of pSET152 [43], generating plasmid pVHom1. (This cloning strategy removes 1.2 kb from the 3None end of the int gene in pSET152.) Conjugation between E. coli ET12567 (pUB307) harboring pVHom1 and Nonomuraea ATCC39727 was performed as described [41]. Briefly, an overnight culture of the donor strain and an exponential, sonicated culture of the recipient strain were plated on BTT agar (10 g/l glucose, 1 g/l yeast extract, 1 g/l beef extract, 2 g/l casitone, 20 g/l agar).

ORFs 31 to 34 are closely related to DpgA through DpgD, respectively (Table 1), which are required for DPG formation [10, 16]. dbv ORF37 encodes a homolog of HpgT, the amino transferase required for the transami-nation of both p-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate and 3,5-dihy-droxyphenylglyoxylate, to yield HPG and DPG, respec-tively [8, 16]. Thus, the seven genes required for HPG and DPG synthesis are also present in the dbv cluster. dbv ORF5, which encodes a homolog of prephenate dehydro-genase, may also participate in HPG synthesis. This func-tion is likely to provide the initial p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate for HPG synthesis. Since HpgT uses Tyr preferentially asFigure 1. Structure of A40926",
