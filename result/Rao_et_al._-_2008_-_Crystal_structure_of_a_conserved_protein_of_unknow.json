INTRODUCTION Methanococcus jannaschii, a strict anaerobic methane-producing organism, provided the first complete genome sequence reported for an archaeon.1 This exercise pro-vided an opportunity to compare the three domains of life at the genetic level for the first time. We have cloned the gene MJ1651 (gi: 15669847) from Methanococcus jan-naschii DSM 2661 and over expressed its 263-residue protein product in E. coli to investigate both three-dimensional structure and function. MJ1651 is a member of the DUF62 Pfam family (pfam 01887),2 which con-tains both archeal and eubacterial members of no known function. Herein, we report the X-ray crystal structure of MJ1651 determined at 2.5 A\u030a resolution via the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using selenium-labeled protein. The structure is composed of two domains: an N-terminal aba sandwich domain and a C-terminal b-strand domain. As expected, the structure of MJ1651 resembles those of other DUF62 family mem-bers. Although its structure is most closely related to that of a bacterial fluorinating enzyme, we suggest that the bi-ological function of MJ1651 is different. MATERIALS AND METHODS Gene cloning and protein production The gene for MJ1651 was amplified using polymerase chain reaction from Methanococcus jannaschii genomic DNA using a forward (GGGATTTATATGAGGGATGAT-ATTTTAG) and a reverse (CAATCTCAATCTCATCTAAA-TAATCAACATTC) primer. The amplified gene was gel purified and cloned into TC -psb3 (TC) vector designed to express the protein of interest with a C-terminal hexa-histidine affinity tag. Protein expression/purification uti-lized previously published protocols, which are described in detail in PepcDB (pepcdb.pdb.org). Crystallization and data collection Single crystals of MJ1651 were grown via sitting-drop vapor diffusion [2 lL protein solution (6\u201310 mg/mL) mixed with 2 lL reservoir solution (600 lL) containing 50% MPD, 0.2M ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, Tris-HCl, pH 8.0]. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen following addition of 15\u201320% (v/v) glycerol to the mother liquor. Diffraction data were collected under standard cryogenic conditions using beamline X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were processed using HKL2000.3 Crystals grew in the monoclinic space group C2 (unit-cell parame-ters: a \u00bc 126.8 A\u030a, b \u00bc 110.1 A\u030a, c \u00bc 75.8 A\u030a, and b \u00bc 115.48). The calculated Matthews coefficient is 2.52 A\u030a3/Da, assuming three molecules per asymmetric unit, which cor-responds to 51% solvent content by volume.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of MJ1651 MJ1651 adopts the a/b fold [Fig. 1(a)]. The molecule has approximate dimensions of 55 3 35 3 35 A\u030a3, and consists of two domains: the N-terminal core domain and the small C-terminal domain. The N-terminal do-main (residues 9\u2013168) is composed of a seven-stranded mixed b-sheet (b1\u2013b7) sandwiched by two a-helices on each side (a1 and a4; a2 and a3). The C-terminal do-main (residues 174\u2013264) is composed of two b-sheets. The four (b8, b9, b12, b13) and three (b10, b11, b14) antiparallel stranded b-sheets are arranged perpendicular to one another forming a small b barrel. A cartoon rep-resentation of the secondary structure is given in Figure 1(b). A 10-residue random coil segment connects the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Biological unit The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains three protomers arranged as a trimer about a threefold NCS axis [Fig. 2(a)]. The three N-terminal domains are tightly clustered around the threefold axis, making intimate con-tact with each other. The C-terminal domains make no intermolecular contacts with each other. Instead, they interact with the N-terminal domains of other monomers making up the trimer. Within the monoclinic crystal form we obtained, MJ1651 forms a hexamer via crystal-lographic symmetry with the two asymmetric units form-ing a dimer of trimers. The two trimers associate front-to-front [Fig. 2(b)] via interactions mediated by three b11 strand from each trimer. After such an association, three six-stranded extended b-sheets formed firmly holds the hexamer assembly. Strands b10, b11, and b14 of each monomer from both the trimers associate to form such three six-stranded continuous b-sheets. We believe that this larger assembly represents the biologically active form of MJ1651, because analytical gel filtration docu-mented that the protein occurs as a hexamer in solution. Comparison with homologous structures A DALI10 search revealed a number of structures simi-lar to that of MJ1651, including PH0463 from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 [PDB ID: 1WU8, Z score \u00bc 23.8, 36% sequence identity, and root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) \u00bc 2.1 A\u030a for 212 structurally equivalent a-carbon atomic pairs], a conserved protein of unknown function (TTHA0338) from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (2CW5, Z \u00bc 24.2, sequence identity \u00bc 26%, and rmsd \u00bc 2.0 A\u030a for 212 pairs), and a fluorinase from Streptomyces cattleya (1RQR/2C2W, Z \u00bc 21.0, sequence identity \u00bc 23%, and rmsd \u00bc 2.8 A\u030a for 217 pairs). Each of these homologs, including the fluorinase (1RQR), belongs to the same Pfam family, DUF62 Pfam. Figure 2 (a) Ribbon diagram of MJ1651 trimer viewed down the non-crystallographic threefold axis. Each monomer is shown in different color. (b) Ribbon diagram showing the MJ1651 hexamer assembly with the two trimers colored red and green. K.N. Rao et al. 574 PROTEINS DOI 10.1002/prot Although the fold of the N-terminal domain of all the DUF62 family structures is the same there are some dif-ferences in the structure of C-terminal domain. The four-stranded b-sheet (b8, b9, b12, b13) is common to all the structures. The other b-sheet is made up of five strands in both 1WU8 and fluorinase, four strands in 2CW5, and three strands in MJ1651 [b10, b11, b14; Fig. 1(b)]. Despite this difference, the strand b11 is conserved in both MJ1651 and fluorinase and they could form the same hexamer assembly. A PSI-BLAST11 search for sequence homologs of MJ1651 identified a number of homologs from both eubacteria and archaea, with several conserved motifs (Fig. 3), including TDFGT (motif 1, residues 19\u201324 forming b1Nonea1 loop), IDISH (motif 2, residues 49\u201353 in the b2-strand), PDNGLFT (motif 3, residues 107\u2013113 of helix a3), TFHGRD (motif 4, residues 137\u2013142 form-ing a4Noneb7 loop), and DRFGN (motif 5, residues 179\u2013 183 forming b8Noneb9 loop). Motif 1 of molecule A inter-acts with motif 5 of molecule C. The IDISH conserved motif 2 residues from each monomer are symmetrically arrayed around the threefold NCS axis near the center of the trimer, where they appear to engage in stabilizing interactions. Residues of motif 3 interact with the loop that connects the N-terminal to C-terminal domain. Motif 4, which is not visible in our structure, is located close to where the N-terminal domain of molecule A contacts the C-terminal domain of molecule C in known structural homologs. At the trimer interface, the interac-tion is mainly between the residues belonging to a1 helix of molecule A and the residues of b1 strands, b2 strands, and a2 helix of molecule C. In addition, residues belong-ing to loop b1Nonea1 of molecule A interact with residues of loop b8Noneb9 of molecule C (molecule B interacts with molecule A in a similar way the molecule A interacts with molecule C). In the sequence alignment illustrated in Figure 3, an extended loop of about 15 residues in the N-terminal domain occurs only in the fluorinase. From our structural analysis it appears that the conserved motifs are important for the structural integrity and qua-ternary structure of the DUF62 family proteins. Quaternary structure Both MJ1651 and the flourinase form front-to-front hexamers via crystallographic symmetry with the two asymmetric units forming a dimer of trimers. Interaction between the two trimers occurs exclusively via C-terminal domain for both MJ1651 and the fluorinase. The three b11 strands from each trimer associate to form a six-stranded continuous b-sheet in MJ1651 and a 10-stranded b-sheet in fluorinase. It is interesting to see here that though MJ1651 and fluorinase differ in the number of strands in this b-sheet (b10, b11, b14 in MJ1651), they form the same hexamer assembly. It is re-markable that the secondary structural elements required for both the trimer and hexamer structural association are preserved in MJ1651 and fluorinase structures. In contrast, 1WU8 forms a back-to-back hexamer via crys-tallographic symmetry, via interactions between N-termi-nal domains. Chlorinase activity assay and putative active site identification X-ray crystal structures of the fluorinase bound to sub-strate and product has been reported.7 This enzyme con-verts inorganic fluorine to organic fluoride by catalyzing CNoneNoneF bond formation. Fluorinase also acts as a chlori-nase.8 Among the DUF62 homolog proteins, the fluori-Figure 3 Multiple sequence alignment of MJ1651 with other available DUF62 family structures in PDB.

Crystal Structure of MJ1651 of M. jannaschii DOI 10.1002/prot PROTEINS 575 nase (chlorinase) from Streptomyces cattleya is the only enzyme with defined biological activity. Despite very low sequence identity (15%), the structures of MJ1651 and flu-orinase are quite similar (rmsd \u00bc 2.8 A\u030a). An assay of hal-ogenase (chlorinase) activity with MJ1651 used for crystal-lization failed to show significant chlorinase activity. The X-ray crystal structure of 1WU8, a protein of unknown function, showed an adenosine molecule bound in position analogous to that occupied by the ad-enine moiety of SAM in the active site of the fluorinase.7 Comparison of this region of the structures 1WU8, the fluorinase, and MJ1651 revealed considerable similarity, which suggests that it represents the active site of DUF62 family members. The fluorinase and MJ1651 share a number of conserved residues in this putative active site, including Asp20 (Asp16 in fluorinase), Phe136 (Phe156), Asp179 (Asp210), Phe181 (Phe213), Asn183 (Asn215), and Ser236 (Ser269). Other residues lining the putative active site are Glu25 (Asp21 in fluorinase), Tyr27 (Ser23), Asp84 (Tyr77), Ala141 (Ser158), Glu237 (Arg270), and Phe245 (Ala279) [Fig. 4(a,b)]. Residues from Asp179 onwards are contributed by the second promoter of the asymmetric unit. In the fluorinase, Ser158 participates in catalysis, binding to the halogen and O4 of SAM. We suggest that these differences in the putative active site reflect functional differences between the fluorinase and MJ1651. CONCLUSIONS We described the determination of the structure of MJ1651 from Methanococcus jannaschii. Structure and sequence comparison with homologous proteins helped us to identify common structural features that explain tri-meric/hexameric self-association of DUF62 family mem-bers. We also identified the putative active site of MJ1651, and documented that the protein is not a chlorinase. The structure has been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (ID: 2F4N).

        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of MJ1651",
        "MJ1651 adopts the a/b fold [Fig. 1(a)]. The molecule has approximate dimensions of 55 3 35 3 35 A\u030a3, and consists of two domains: the N-terminal core domain and the small C-terminal domain. The N-terminal do-main (residues 9\u2013168) is composed of a seven-stranded mixed b-sheet (b1\u2013b7) sandwiched by two a-helices on each side (a1 and a4; a2 and a3). The C-terminal do-main (residues 174\u2013264) is composed of two b-sheets. The four (b8, b9, b12, b13) and three (b10, b11, b14) antiparallel stranded b-sheets are arranged perpendicular to one another forming a small b barrel. A cartoon rep-resentation of the secondary structure is given in Figure 1(b). A 10-residue random coil segment connects the N-terminal and C-terminal domains.",
        "Biological unit",
        "The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains three protomers arranged as a trimer about a threefold NCS axis [Fig. 2(a)]. The three N-terminal domains are tightly clustered around the threefold axis, making intimate con-tact with each other. The C-terminal domains make no intermolecular contacts with each other. Instead, they interact with the N-terminal domains of other monomers making up the trimer. Within the monoclinic crystal form we obtained, MJ1651 forms a hexamer via crystal-lographic symmetry with the two asymmetric units form-ing a dimer of trimers. The two trimers associate front-to-front [Fig. 2(b)] via interactions mediated by three b11 strand from each trimer. After such an association, three six-stranded extended b-sheets formed firmly holds the hexamer assembly. Strands b10, b11, and b14 of each monomer from both the trimers associate to form such three six-stranded continuous b-sheets. We believe that this larger assembly represents the biologically active form of MJ1651, because analytical gel filtration docu-mented that the protein occurs as a hexamer in solution.",
        "Comparison with homologous structures",
        "A DALI10 search revealed a number of structures simi-lar to that of MJ1651, including PH0463 from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 [PDB ID: 1WU8, Z score \u00bc 23.8, 36% sequence identity, and root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) \u00bc 2.1 A\u030a for 212 structurally equivalent a-carbon atomic pairs], a conserved protein of unknown function (TTHA0338) from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (2CW5, Z \u00bc 24.2, sequence identity \u00bc 26%, and rmsd \u00bc 2.0 A\u030a for 212 pairs), and a fluorinase from Streptomyces cattleya (1RQR/2C2W, Z \u00bc 21.0, sequence identity \u00bc 23%, and rmsd \u00bc 2.8 A\u030a for 217 pairs).

        "Although the fold of the N-terminal domain of all the DUF62 family structures is the same there are some dif-ferences in the structure of C-terminal domain. The four-stranded b-sheet (b8, b9, b12, b13) is common to all the structures. The other b-sheet is made up of five strands in both 1WU8 and fluorinase, four strands in 2CW5, and three strands in MJ1651 [b10, b11, b14; Fig. 1(b)]. Despite this difference, the strand b11 is conserved in both MJ1651 and fluorinase and they could form the same hexamer assembly.",
        "A PSI-BLAST11 search for sequence homologs of MJ1651 identified a number of homologs from both eubacteria and archaea, with several conserved motifs (Fig. 3), including TDFGT (motif 1, residues 19\u201324 forming b1Nonea1 loop), IDISH (motif 2, residues 49\u201353 in the b2-strand), PDNGLFT (motif 3, residues 107\u2013113 of helix a3), TFHGRD (motif 4, residues 137\u2013142 form-ing a4Noneb7 loop), and DRFGN (motif 5, residues 179\u2013 183 forming b8Noneb9 loop). Motif 1 of molecule A inter-acts with motif 5 of molecule C. The IDISH conserved motif 2 residues from each monomer are symmetrically arrayed around the threefold NCS axis near the center of the trimer, where they appear to engage in stabilizing interactions. Residues of motif 3 interact with the loop that connects the N-terminal to C-terminal domain. Motif 4, which is not visible in our structure, is located close to where the N-terminal domain of molecule A contacts the C-terminal domain of molecule C in known structural homologs. At the trimer interface, the interac-tion is mainly between the residues belonging to a1 helix of molecule A and the residues of b1 strands, b2 strands, and a2 helix of molecule C. In addition, residues belong-ing to loop b1Nonea1 of molecule A interact with residues of loop b8Noneb9 of molecule C (molecule B interacts with molecule A in a similar way the molecule A interacts with molecule C). In the sequence alignment illustrated in Figure 3, an extended loop of about 15 residues in the N-terminal domain occurs only in the fluorinase. From our structural analysis it appears that the conserved motifs are important for the structural integrity and qua-ternary structure of the DUF62 family proteins.",
        "Quaternary structure",
        "Both MJ1651 and the flourinase form front-to-front hexamers via crystallographic symmetry with the two asymmetric units forming a dimer of trimers. Interaction between the two trimers occurs exclusively via C-terminal domain for both MJ1651 and the fluorinase. The three b11 strands from each trimer associate to form a six-stranded continuous b-sheet in MJ1651 and a 10-stranded b-sheet in fluorinase. It is interesting to see here that though MJ1651 and fluorinase differ in the number of strands in this b-sheet (b10, b11, b14 in MJ1651), they form the same hexamer assembly. It is re-markable that the secondary structural elements required for both the trimer and hexamer structural association are preserved in MJ1651 and fluorinase structures. In contrast, 1WU8 forms a back-to-back hexamer via crys-tallographic symmetry, via interactions between N-termi-nal domains.",

        "The X-ray crystal structure of 1WU8, a protein of unknown function, showed an adenosine molecule bound in position analogous to that occupied by the ad-enine moiety of SAM in the active site of the fluorinase.7 Comparison of this region of the structures 1WU8, the fluorinase, and MJ1651 revealed considerable similarity, which suggests that it represents the active site of DUF62 family members. The fluorinase and MJ1651 share a number of conserved residues in this putative active site, including Asp20 (Asp16 in fluorinase), Phe136 (Phe156), Asp179 (Asp210), Phe181 (Phe213), Asn183 (Asn215), and Ser236 (Ser269). Other residues lining the putative active site are Glu25 (Asp21 in fluorinase), Tyr27 (Ser23), Asp84 (Tyr77), Ala141 (Ser158), Glu237 (Arg270), and Phe245 (Ala279) [Fig. 4(a,b)]. Residues from Asp179 onwards are contributed by the second promoter of the asymmetric unit. In the fluorinase, Ser158 participates in catalysis, binding to the halogen and O4 of SAM. We suggest that these differences in the putative active site reflect functional differences between the fluorinase and MJ1651.",
        "CONCLUSIONS",
        "We described the determination of the structure of MJ1651 from Methanococcus jannaschii. Structure and sequence comparison with homologous proteins helped us to identify common structural features that explain tri-meric/hexameric self-association of DUF62 family mem-bers. We also identified the putative active site of MJ1651, and documented that the protein is not a chlorinase.",
