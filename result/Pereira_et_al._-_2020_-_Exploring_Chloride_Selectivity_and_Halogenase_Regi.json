Our results shed light on the interesting fact that the substitution of chloride with fluorine in SalL chlorinase leads to a loss of halogenase activity. The potential of mean force based on DFTB3/MM analysis shows that fluorination corresponds to a barrier 13.5 kcal\u00b7mol-1 higher than chlorination. Additionally, our results present a molecular description of SalL acting as a chlorinase instead of a methyl-halide transferase.  INTRODUCTION Methyltransferases and halogenases play important roles in normal physiology and human diseases.1,2 This class of enzymes uses a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) methyl transfer mechanism, where S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet or SAM) donates a methyl to a nitrogen, oxygen, or halogen atom.3 Particularly, some studies have investigated the potential of halogenase enzymes, responsible for the biosynthesis of halogenated natural products, as biocatalysts.4,5 There are a number of fundamentally different classes of halogenases, which are categorized on the basis of the mechanism by which they generate and utilize activated halide.5,6 For example, the enzyme Chlorinase SalL halogenates S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) with chloride to generate 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine and L-methionine7 (Scheme 1a). On the other hand, SAM-dependent halide methyltransferases can utilize SAM to produce halo-methanes, CH3X (X = Cl, Br, I) 8 (Scheme 1b). The SN2 reaction represented in Scheme 1a is analogous to that observed in Streptomyces cattleya fluorinase9 and is associated with the biosynthesis of the potent proteasome inhibitor salinospor-amide A, a chlorinated anticancer candidate.10 It is well-known that the chlorinase SalL accepts Cl-, Br-, and I-, but not F-as nucleophilic groups.6,7 It determines the nature of reaction products, where the chlorinase SalL produces, mainly, 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine and not chloromethane, as presented in Scheme 1b. Recently, the origin of the catalytic effect of methyltrans-ferases has been explored successfully by using QM/MM and free energy surface approaches.11-13 In this study, the QM/MM method at the DFTB3/AMBER level has been used to provide a detailed molecular insight into the selectivity of the SalL chlorinase enzyme in the presence of two particular ions (Cl-and F-). This provides access to a comparison of the free energy barrier for the possible mechanism pathways which could be promoted by the catalytic site of the SalL chlorinase enzyme, where selectivity and regioselectivity are deeply explored. We have shown that SalL activity and regioselectivity are well reproduced by our theoretical results, providing a detailed molecular rationalization. Considering the fact that halogenated organic compounds have been attractive for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals by different benefits, we have discussed the relevance of our results for understanding the mechanisms of SalL halogenation.  COMPUTATIONAL METHODS Modeling the Initial Structures. The complex SalL with SAM and Cl-was modeled from a SalL-Y70T X-ray crystallographic structure that was obtained from the Protein Data Bank14 (PDB code 2Q6O).7 The native structure has been obtained by replacing the Tyr70 by a Thr residue.

SalL with SAM and F-was modeled by substituting the Cl-for F-in the active site. Hydrogen atoms of enzyme-substrate complexes were added by the tLeap module of Amber16. The protonation states of acidic and basic residues were determined under pH 7.0 condition and analyzed by H++ server.15 All-atom force field (AMBER ff14SB)16 and general amber force field (GAFF)17 were used to describe SalL and SAM, respectively. The SAM charges were calculated on the Gaussian 09 software suite18 using the Hartree-Fock method with 6-31G* basis.19 The systems were solvated in a truncated octahedral water-box with the explicit solvation model TIP3P.20 We used a distance of 12.0 \u00c5 between the cell wall and the solvated atoms of the system. Counterions were also added to neutralize the system. QM/MM MD and Free Energy Simulations. Semi-empirical QM/MM calculations were performed using the DFTB3 Hamiltonian21 for atoms in the quantum region. For all QM/MM calculations, the QM region consisted of the ligand (SAM) and the ions Cl-or F-. The hydrogen \u201clink atom\u201d was used to model the bond across the QM/MM boundary (See Figure 1). The total charge of the QM region was 0. The initial structures of the complexes were minimized first by 10 000 cycles of steepest descent and conjugate gradient22 algorithms with restraints on the coordinates of the QM atoms. Then, the whole system was minimized with the progressive relaxation of restraints. We used 20 ps to raise the temperature gradually from 10 to 300 K. Afterward, 50 ps of unrestrained QM/MM MD simulations were carried out for reactant state (RS) complexes. It was performed using periodic boundary conditions with a cutoff distance of 12.0 \u00c5 and a time step of 1.0 fs. Further umbrella-sampling MD simulations were then performed (at the DFTB3/ff14SB level) in order to calculate the activation barrier for the nucleophilic attack of Cl-on C5\u2032 atom bonded to the sulfur atom of SAM (see a detailed scheme of reaction coordinates for this study in Figure 1). Coordinates and velocities obtained after 5 ps of simulation (equilibration runs) for the first reaction coordinate value were used to start the simulation for the next reaction coordinate value. The simulation was divided into 35 windows with each window simulated for 60 ps (production runs). The reaction coordinate \u03be = d (S-C5\u2032) -(Cl-C5\u2032), was constrained using a force constant of 500 kcal/mol \u00c52 and scanned from -1.70 to 1.70 \u00c5 in steps of 0.10 \u00c5. The same procedure was used to investigate the nucleophilic attack of F-on C5\u2032. Finally, the nucleophilic attack of Cl-on CE atom of SAM to produce chloromethane and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) was investigated with the reaction coordinate \u03be = d (S-CE) -(Cl-CE). Scheme 1. (a) Representation of the Halogenation of SAM to Generate L-Methionine (L-MET) and 5-Chloro-5-deoxyadenosine Free energy profiles were obtained from these simulations using the weighted-histogram analysis method23 with a convergence tolerance of 0.000 01 and a temperature of 300 K. The boundaries of the histogram were -1.70 to 1.70 and the numbers of bins were set to 1000. The transition state was identified as the highest energy point along with the free energy profile. In order to validate the semiempirical level of theory implemented in QM/MM calculations, single-point calculations at M06-2X-D3/MM level were carried out using 400 snapshots from reactant and transition states obtained from free energy profiles at DFTB3/MM level, which has been applied on previous enzymatic studies.24-27 The correction added to the free energy profiles was computed by using a straightforward one-step free energy perturbation: G k eTln E E M062X DFTB3 B ( ) DFTB3/MM M062X/MM DFTB3/MM \u0394 = -\u27e8 \u27e9\u03b2 ---(1) Residual Decomposition Analysis. The energy decom-position method to analyze how the enzymatic environment stabilizes or destabilizes the transition state (TS) in the catalyzed reaction of SalL with SAM in the presence of Cl-or F-ions. This approach has been successfully applied to enzyme systems.28,29 In this procedure, the energetic contribution of an individual residue on the total energy of a particular structure is computed by using the difference of energies when this particular residue is present (i state) and when it is replaced by Gly residue (i -1 state),30,31 according to eq 1: E E E E Ei i i i i1 QM 1 QM/MM\u0394 = [ -] + [ -]--(2) where each term in brackets represents the difference energy of the subsystem treated by the QM level in the presence of the classical environment and the interaction energy between the QM and MM part. Therefore, the stabilization effects in going from R to TS, for each residue, were calculated by eq 3: E E Ei i i TS R\u0394\u0394 = \u0394 -\u0394 (3) Here, the QM subsystem was described previously on the umbrella sampling MD simulations and the average values for the interaction energy and stabilization effects were computed from 400 snapshots from MD simulations taken from the QM/ MM umbrella sampling with reaction coordinates correspond-ing to the R and TS states.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION QM/MM Free Energy Profiles for Chloride Selectivity. The SalL enzyme, a homologue that shares 35% sequence identity with 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine synthase, has been shown to catalyze chlorination under native conditions but does not catalyze fluorination.7,32 Kinetic properties have been determined experimentally for SalL chlorinase from Salinispora tropica (kcat 0.9\u00b1 0.1 min -1 for Cl-and activity not detected for F-).7 Thus, that kinetic constant means a barrier of\u0394G\u2021\u223c 20.06 kcal/mol using Transition State Theory.33 The free energy profiles for reactions in the enzyme are presented in Figure 2. The free energy of activation for a reaction involving SalL and Cl-corresponds to 17.57 kcal/mol, while the barrier for a reaction involving SalL and F-is 30.90 kcal/mol. The calculated activation free energies for reactions in protein are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental values described above. In order to evaluate the convergence of the calculated PMF, we have computed\u0394G\u2021 for each reaction using different sampling times (20, 40, and 60 ps) for eachUSwindow. The results show that sampling obtained from 40 ps of MD simulations is similar to sampling for 60 ps for all systems studied (see Table S1). The reaction catalyzed by the native enzyme reveals that the thermodynamic profile is exergonic (\u0394G =-14.10 kcal/mol), as shown in Figure 2. Considering the nucleophilic attack of F-to C5\u2032, the difference between the activation free energies (\u0394\u0394G\u2021), is about \u223c13.5 kcal/mol, showing that it is a kinetically unfavorable reaction and agrees with the experimental data that shows no reactivity observed.7 The free energy barriers obtained by the corrected PMFs using M06-2X-D3/6-31G* as high QM level are 14.51 and 29.32 kcal/mol for the SaIL-Cl and SaIL-F systems, respectively, showing that DFTB3 is in good agreement to high theory level as DFT. It reproduces the same trend in the difference in activation free energy of the reactions with chloride and fluoride ions (\u0394\u0394G\u2021 \u223c 14.8 kcal/mol). According to results obtained from umbrella sampling simulations, structural analysis suggests that Tyr70 and Gly131 residues appear to stabilize the TS by interacting with the nucleophilic group (Cl-or F-ion). Even though previous computational study underestimates the true value of SalL chlorination of SAM, they revealed the importance of the interaction between the chloride and backbone amide of Gly131, which are extremely conserved in DUF62 proteins.34,35 Replacement of Gly131 by serine to engineer a similarity to the fluorinase resulted in instability and arrested chlorination.36 The Ser158 (in fluorinase) corresponds to Gly131 in SalL. It was proposed to offset the energetic cost of desolvation of fluoride through compensatory hydrogen bonding.7 Furthermore, our calculations are in agreement with the idea of a bimolecular nucleophilic SN2 type substitution mechanism, with a Cl -ion instead of F-, where the chloride ion adopts a position approximately 180\u00b0 from the electrophilic C5\u2032 carbon of SAM, consistent also with an SN2 mechanism as described for the fluorinase.36,37 An overview of the computational studies made for halogenases38 showed fluorinase able to catalyze the reaction with chlorine, but with higher activation energy (\u0394\u0394Gexp\u2021 = 12 kJ/mol against \u0394\u0394Gcalc\u2021 = 10 kJ/mol).39 In addition, Senn38 Figure 2. Free energy profiles calculated at DFTB3/MM level for the discusses another study performed byHealy,40 which shows that the microsolvation of the chloride by one water molecule in the active site reduces its nucleophilicity and may account for the significantly lower activity of the Tyr70Thr mutant compared to the wild-type. Here, our results demonstrate the importance of Tyr70 in giving for support during a nucleophilic attack on the catalytic reaction. Besides, Trp129 residue provides a stabilizing effect for the transition state of the reaction. Energetic Figure 3. More O\u2019Ferrall-Jencks diagrams of the chlorination of SAM by the SalL enzyme, with coordinates defined using modified Pauling bond contributions for stabilizing the reaction will be discussed below. On the other hand, our study presented how SalL chlorinase (a different enzyme from fluorinase) accepts chloride and not fluoride in SAM halogenation. Besides that, we presented a structural and energetic analysis that shows that SalL is unlikely to act as a methyl halide transferase. In order to understand the real nature of the chlorination of SAM by the SalL enzyme, a \u201creaction space\u201d plot based on a More O\u2019Ferral-Jenk (MOJ) style diagram41 was done. It is well-known that a concerted SN2 mechanism can be described by ANDN where the association of the nucleophile and dissociation of the leaving group, each with an unbonded electron pair, are indicated by AN and DN, respectively. 42 This approach was used successfully to describe the mechanism of Trypanosoma cruzi trans-Sialidase43 using Pauling bond orders, np. 44 Thus, once we have the bond order usually defined as a function of bond length, we define the bond order MOJ diagram with the bond-making axis equal to np(BM) and the bond-breaking axis equal to [1 -np(BB)]. The partial bond order indices were calculated using eq 4 from the bond lengths of the structures along the minimum free energy path. This equation has been useful in the interpretation of transition state geometries.43,45 n n R Rexp ( )/0.6p 0 0= [ -] (4) where R denotes the average distance between the S or Cl-and the C5\u2032, n0 = 1, R0 = 1.8, and 0.6 is a proportionality constant. Figure 3 presents the bond orders derived from the original Pauling equation (eq 4). It indicates more bond-breaking than bond-making in the transition state. In other words, we can define the mechanism is a dissociative one, whichmeans that the leaving group departs well before the TS is reached. The bond orders at the TS to the BM and the BB were 0.29 and 0.59, respectively. QM/MM Free Energy Profiles for SalL Acting As a Methyl-Halide Transferase. In order to evaluate SalL as methyl-halide transferase, we have simulated the nucleophilic attack of Cl-to CE atom of SAM to obtain chloromethane and SAH as reaction products (Scheme 1b). Due to the SAM sulfonium moiety and the leaving group propensity of the resultant thioether, different enzymes have been identified that catalyze nucleophilic attack at all three carbons (C5\u2032, CE, and C5) of SAM positioned adjacent to this sulfonium sulfur.36 According to our calculations, by comparing the activation free energy for SalL as a chlorinase and methyl-halide transferase, the highest value of \u0394G\u2021 found was 41.95 kcal/mol for the SalL-halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) system, which is 24.38 kcal/mol higher than the SalL-Cl system (Figure 4). The corrected \u0394G\u2021 value for the SalL-HTMT system computed at theM06-2X-D3/6-31G* level is 42.00 kcal/mol, only 0.05 kcal/ mol higher than the DFTB3 result, which demonstrates good agreement between the lower and higher QM levels. In order to understand the difference between SalL acting as a chlorinase and methyl-halide transferase, the Mulliken charge changes were calculated for ensembles taken from QM/MM umbrella sampling calculations on each stationary point (Table 1). As the reaction progresses, the atomic charge on C5\u2032 and CE changes from negative to neutral as it becomes attacked by the nucleophile (Cl-in these cases). As chlorine has a charge of -0.18 au, the C5\u2032-Cl bond has already been formed with the release of energy, as can be seen in Figure 2. On the other hand, a charge of -0.16 au was observed when the CE-Cl bond was already formed. The bond-breaking process shows that in the TS the distance between S and C5\u2032 is 2.41 \u00b1 0.06 \u00c5 while the distance between S and CE is 2.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00c5 (Table 2). In addition, it is important to note that the positively charged sulfonium ion, where the S atom has a charge of 0.37 au and 0.38 au for the attack to C5\u2032 and CE, respectively, confers stability to the catalytic site. Thus, a greater charge transfer of the nucleophile in both chlorinase and halogenase action is observed, in which the chloride ion significantly loses its negative charge. The nucleophilic attack to CE atom of SAM leads to the formation of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) whose crystal structure has been solved.46 SAH is devoid of the sulfonium methyl group of SAM, thus, has neutral sulfur, and is an unreactive substrate analog. Additionally, we have evaluated the influence of the SalL enzyme on the electrostatic potential surfaces of the SAM and Cl-along with the reaction coordinates, determining the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces for it in a protein environment (see Figure 5, and Figure S1 for all MEPs). This strategy has been successfully applied in previous enzymatic systems.47,48 Here, MEP surfaces were obtained from the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level using representative structures obtained from optimized RS, TS, and PS reaction coordinates. These surfaces correspond to an isodensity value of 0.002 au. The most nucleophilic regions (negative electronic Table 1. Average Mulliken Charges (Calculated at the potential) are shown in red, while the most electrophilic regions (positive electrostatic potential) are shown in blue. Considering all three carbons (C5\u2032, C5, and CE) of SAM positioned adjacent to the sulfonium sulfur, our results show regions of positive charge predominantly on C5\u2032, which corresponds to an electrophilic region. In this way, the attack on this carbon is facilitated so that the SalL enzyme prefers to act to form L-methionine instead of chloromethane. Even though halide methyltransferases are promising biocatalysts for the production of halomethanes,6,49 there is no computational study that shows in detail the reaction of this class of enzymes. However, comparing our reactant state with the structure of a SAM-dependent halide methyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB ID 3LCC)50 we can see at least two active site residues that may be essential for methyl-halide transferase, including Val23 and Tyr172 (see Figure S2). Particularly, experimental evidence shows that the residue Tyr172 plays the role to orientate the smaller chloride nucleophile through a bridging water molecule,50 similar to the role of Ty70 in SalL enzyme. Interaction Energy Decomposition Analysis. The origin of the substrate-enzyme interaction can be availed by decomposing the total interaction energy on different chemical stages, such as reactant and transition states, taking into account the changes that occurred when a particular amino acid residue is removed from the enzymatic environment, as described in the method section. Then, to get suitable statistical values about this type of analysis, 400 snapshots extracted from QM/MM umbrella sampling simulations were used to compute the influence of amino acid residues 10 \u00c5 around QM region. The \u0394\u0394E values for each residue indicate the degree of stabilization/ destabilization of the reactant and transition states from the enzymatic environment over the QM part (Figure 6). From Figure 6, it can be observed how TS is stabilized by interactions SalL-HTMT (-2.06 kcal/mol) systems; (b) the Trp129 residue exerts a strong stabilizing effect on the TS state of the SalL-Cl (-8.74 kcal/mol) system and a suitable stabilizing effect on the SalL-HTMT (-1.24 kcal/mol) system. The structural influence of Trp129 occurs at the leaving group of SAM (Figure 7), where this result agrees with a more favorable halogenase activity for the SaIL enzyme. Overall, these results suggest that the halogenase activity by Cl-ion on the catalytic site of the SalL enzyme occurs by a strong stabilization effect on the TS. In general, SalL-Cl and SalL-HTMT systems have similar interactions for the TS state stabilization; however, Trp129 stabilizes the TS state of SalL-Cl more than SalL-HTMT, once the leaving group of halogenase reaction (L-methionine, Figure 7) is more stabilized than the Naturais, Universidade Federal do Para,\u0301 Belem\u0301 66075-110, Brasil; orcid.org/0000-0003-2310-5107 Cla\u0301udio N.

        "ABSTRACT: The catalytic mechanism of SalL chlorinase has been investigated by combining quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) techni-ques and umbrella sampling simulations to compute free energy profiles. Our results shed light on the interesting fact that the substitution of chloride with fluorine in SalL chlorinase leads to a loss of halogenase activity. The potential of mean force based on DFTB3/MM analysis shows that fluorination corresponds to a barrier 13.5 kcal\u00b7mol-1 higher than chlorination. Additionally, our results present a molecular description of SalL acting as a chlorinase instead of a methyl-halide transferase.",
        "INTRODUCTION Methyltransferases and halogenases play important roles in normal physiology and human diseases.1,2 This class of enzymes uses a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) methyl transfer mechanism, where S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet or SAM) donates a methyl to a nitrogen, oxygen, or halogen atom.3 Particularly, some studies have investigated the potential of halogenase enzymes, responsible for the biosynthesis of halogenated natural products, as biocatalysts.4,5 There are a number of fundamentally different classes of halogenases, which are categorized on the basis of the mechanism by which they generate and utilize activated halide.5,6 For example, the enzyme Chlorinase SalL halogenates S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) with chloride to generate 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine and L-methionine7 (Scheme 1a). On the other hand, SAM-dependent halide methyltransferases can utilize SAM to produce halo-methanes, CH3X (X = Cl, Br, I) 8 (Scheme 1b). The SN2 reaction represented in Scheme 1a is analogous to that observed in Streptomyces cattleya fluorinase9 and is associated with the biosynthesis of the potent proteasome inhibitor salinospor-amide A, a chlorinated anticancer candidate.10",
        "It is well-known that the chlorinase SalL accepts Cl-, Br-, and I-, but not F-as nucleophilic groups.6,7 It determines the nature of reaction products, where the chlorinase SalL produces, mainly, 5\u2032-chloro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine and not chloromethane, as presented in Scheme 1b.",
        "Recently, the origin of the catalytic effect of methyltrans-ferases has been explored successfully by using QM/MM and free energy surface approaches.11-13 In this study, the QM/MM method at the DFTB3/AMBER level has been used to provide a detailed molecular insight into the selectivity of the SalL chlorinase enzyme in the presence of two particular ions (Cl-and F-). This provides access to a comparison of the free energy barrier for the possible mechanism pathways which could be promoted by the catalytic site of the SalL chlorinase enzyme, where selectivity and regioselectivity are deeply explored. We have shown that SalL activity and regioselectivity are well reproduced by our theoretical results, providing a detailed molecular rationalization. Considering the fact that halogenated organic compounds have been attractive for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals by different benefits, we have discussed the relevance of our results for understanding the mechanisms of SalL halogenation.",

The total charge of the QM region was 0. The initial structures of the complexes were minimized first by 10 000 cycles of steepest descent and conjugate gradient22 algorithms with restraints on the coordinates of the QM atoms. Then, the whole system was minimized with the progressive relaxation of restraints. We used 20 ps to raise the temperature gradually from 10 to 300 K. Afterward, 50 ps of unrestrained QM/MM MD simulations were carried out for reactant state (RS) complexes.

Coordinates and velocities obtained after 5 ps of simulation (equilibration runs) for the first reaction coordinate value were used to start the simulation for the next reaction coordinate value. The simulation was divided into 35 windows with each window simulated for 60 ps (production runs).

The same procedure was used to investigate the nucleophilic attack of F-on C5\u2032. Finally, the nucleophilic attack of Cl-on CE atom of SAM to produce chloromethane and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) was investigated with the reaction coordinate \u03be = d (S-CE) -(Cl-CE).",

        "QM/MM Free Energy Profiles for Chloride Selectivity. The SalL enzyme, a homologue that shares 35% sequence identity with 5\u2032-fluoro-5\u2032-deoxyadenosine synthase, has been shown to catalyze chlorination under native conditions but does not catalyze fluorination.7,32 Kinetic properties have been determined experimentally for SalL chlorinase from Salinispora tropica (kcat 0.9\u00b1 0.1 min -1 for Cl-and activity not detected for F-).7 Thus, that kinetic constant means a barrier of\u0394G\u2021\u223c 20.06 kcal/mol using Transition State Theory.33 The free energy profiles for reactions in the enzyme are presented in Figure 2.",
        "The free energy of activation for a reaction involving SalL and Cl-corresponds to 17.57 kcal/mol, while the barrier for a reaction involving SalL and F-is 30.90 kcal/mol. The calculated activation free energies for reactions in protein are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental values described above. In order to evaluate the convergence of the calculated PMF, we have computed\u0394G\u2021 for each reaction using different sampling times (20, 40, and 60 ps) for eachUSwindow. The results show that sampling obtained from 40 ps of MD simulations is similar to sampling for 60 ps for all systems studied (see Table S1).",
        "The reaction catalyzed by the native enzyme reveals that the thermodynamic profile is exergonic (\u0394G =-14.10 kcal/mol), as shown in Figure 2. Considering the nucleophilic attack of F-to C5\u2032, the difference between the activation free energies (\u0394\u0394G\u2021), is about \u223c13.5 kcal/mol, showing that it is a kinetically unfavorable reaction and agrees with the experimental data that shows no reactivity observed.7 The free energy barriers obtained by the corrected PMFs using M06-2X-D3/6-31G* as high QM level are 14.51 and 29.32 kcal/mol for the SaIL-Cl and SaIL-F systems, respectively, showing that DFTB3 is in good agreement to high theory level as DFT. It reproduces the same trend in the difference in activation free energy of the reactions with chloride and fluoride ions (\u0394\u0394G\u2021 \u223c 14.8 kcal/mol).",
        "According to results obtained from umbrella sampling simulations, structural analysis suggests that Tyr70 and Gly131 residues appear to stabilize the TS by interacting with the nucleophilic group (Cl-or F-ion). Even though previous computational study underestimates the true value of SalL chlorination of SAM, they revealed the importance of the interaction between the chloride and backbone amide of Gly131, which are extremely conserved in DUF62 proteins.34,35 Replacement of Gly131 by serine to engineer a similarity to the fluorinase resulted in instability and arrested chlorination.36 The Ser158 (in fluorinase) corresponds to Gly131 in SalL. It was proposed to offset the energetic cost of desolvation of fluoride through compensatory hydrogen bonding.7 Furthermore, our calculations are in agreement with the idea of a bimolecular nucleophilic SN2 type substitution mechanism, with a Cl -ion instead of F-, where the chloride ion adopts a position approximately 180\u00b0 from the electrophilic C5\u2032 carbon of SAM, consistent also with an SN2 mechanism as described for the fluorinase.36,37",
        "An overview of the computational studies made for halogenases38 showed fluorinase able to catalyze the reaction with chlorine, but with higher activation energy (\u0394\u0394Gexp\u2021 = 12 kJ/mol against \u0394\u0394Gcalc\u2021 = 10 kJ/mol).39 In addition, Senn38",

        "In order to understand the real nature of the chlorination of SAM by the SalL enzyme, a \u201creaction space\u201d plot based on a More O\u2019Ferral-Jenk (MOJ) style diagram41 was done. It is well-known that a concerted SN2 mechanism can be described by ANDN where the association of the nucleophile and dissociation of the leaving group, each with an unbonded electron pair, are indicated by AN and DN, respectively. 42 This approach was used successfully to describe the mechanism of Trypanosoma cruzi trans-Sialidase43 using Pauling bond orders, np. 44 Thus, once we have the bond order usually defined as a function of bond length, we define the bond order MOJ diagram with the bond-making axis equal to np(BM) and the bond-breaking axis equal to [1 -np(BB)].",
        "The partial bond order indices were calculated using eq 4 from the bond lengths of the structures along the minimum free energy path. This equation has been useful in the interpretation of transition state geometries.43,45",

        "Figure 3 presents the bond orders derived from the original Pauling equation (eq 4). It indicates more bond-breaking than bond-making in the transition state. In other words, we can define the mechanism is a dissociative one, whichmeans that the leaving group departs well before the TS is reached. The bond orders at the TS to the BM and the BB were 0.29 and 0.59, respectively.",
        "QM/MM Free Energy Profiles for SalL Acting As a Methyl-Halide Transferase. In order to evaluate SalL as methyl-halide transferase, we have simulated the nucleophilic attack of Cl-to CE atom of SAM to obtain chloromethane and SAH as reaction products (Scheme 1b). Due to the SAM sulfonium moiety and the leaving group propensity of the resultant thioether, different enzymes have been identified that catalyze nucleophilic attack at all three carbons (C5\u2032, CE, and C5) of SAM positioned adjacent to this sulfonium sulfur.36 According to our calculations, by comparing the activation free energy for SalL as a chlorinase and methyl-halide transferase, the highest value of \u0394G\u2021 found was 41.95 kcal/mol for the SalL-halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) system, which is 24.38 kcal/mol higher than the SalL-Cl system (Figure 4). The corrected \u0394G\u2021 value for the SalL-HTMT system computed at theM06-2X-D3/6-31G* level is 42.00 kcal/mol, only 0.05 kcal/ mol higher than the DFTB3 result, which demonstrates good agreement between the lower and higher QM levels.",
        "In order to understand the difference between SalL acting as a chlorinase and methyl-halide transferase, the Mulliken charge changes were calculated for ensembles taken from QM/MM umbrella sampling calculations on each stationary point (Table 1).",
        "As the reaction progresses, the atomic charge on C5\u2032 and CE changes from negative to neutral as it becomes attacked by the nucleophile (Cl-in these cases). As chlorine has a charge of -0.18 au, the C5\u2032-Cl bond has already been formed with the release of energy, as can be seen in Figure 2. On the other hand, a charge of -0.16 au was observed when the CE-Cl bond was already formed. The bond-breaking process shows that in the TS the distance between S and C5\u2032 is 2.41 \u00b1 0.06 \u00c5 while the distance between S and CE is 2.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00c5 (Table 2). In",
        "addition, it is important to note that the positively charged sulfonium ion, where the S atom has a charge of 0.37 au and 0.38 au for the attack to C5\u2032 and CE, respectively, confers stability to the catalytic site. Thus, a greater charge transfer of the nucleophile in both chlorinase and halogenase action is observed, in which the chloride ion significantly loses its negative charge.",
        "The nucleophilic attack to CE atom of SAM leads to the formation of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) whose crystal structure has been solved.46 SAH is devoid of the sulfonium methyl group of SAM, thus, has neutral sulfur, and is an unreactive substrate analog.",
        "Additionally, we have evaluated the influence of the SalL enzyme on the electrostatic potential surfaces of the SAM and Cl-along with the reaction coordinates, determining the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces for it in a protein environment (see Figure 5, and Figure S1 for all MEPs). This strategy has been successfully applied in previous enzymatic systems.47,48 Here, MEP surfaces were obtained from the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level using representative structures obtained from optimized RS, TS, and PS reaction coordinates. These surfaces correspond to an isodensity value of 0.002 au. The most nucleophilic regions (negative electronic",

        "Considering all three carbons (C5\u2032, C5, and CE) of SAM positioned adjacent to the sulfonium sulfur, our results show regions of positive charge predominantly on C5\u2032, which corresponds to an electrophilic region. In this way, the attack on this carbon is facilitated so that the SalL enzyme prefers to act to form L-methionine instead of chloromethane.",
        "Even though halide methyltransferases are promising biocatalysts for the production of halomethanes,6,49 there is no computational study that shows in detail the reaction of this class of enzymes. However, comparing our reactant state with the structure of a SAM-dependent halide methyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB ID 3LCC)50 we can see at least two active site residues that may be essential for methyl-halide transferase, including Val23 and Tyr172 (see Figure S2). Particularly, experimental evidence shows that the residue Tyr172 plays the role to orientate the smaller chloride nucleophile through a bridging water molecule,50 similar to the role of Ty70 in SalL enzyme.",
        "Interaction Energy Decomposition Analysis. The origin of the substrate-enzyme interaction can be availed by decomposing the total interaction energy on different chemical stages, such as reactant and transition states, taking into account the changes that occurred when a particular amino acid residue is removed from the enzymatic environment, as described in the method section. Then, to get suitable statistical values about this type of analysis, 400 snapshots extracted from QM/MM umbrella sampling simulations were used to compute the influence of amino acid residues 10 \u00c5 around QM region. The \u0394\u0394E values for each residue indicate the degree of stabilization/ destabilization of the reactant and transition states from the enzymatic environment over the QM part (Figure 6). From Figure 6, it can be observed how TS is stabilized by interactions",
        "SalL-HTMT (-2.06 kcal/mol) systems; (b) the Trp129 residue exerts a strong stabilizing effect on the TS state of the SalL-Cl (-8.74 kcal/mol) system and a suitable stabilizing effect on the SalL-HTMT (-1.24 kcal/mol) system. The structural influence of Trp129 occurs at the leaving group of SAM (Figure 7), where this result agrees with a more favorable halogenase activity for the SaIL enzyme.",
        "Overall, these results suggest that the halogenase activity by Cl-ion on the catalytic site of the SalL enzyme occurs by a strong stabilization effect on the TS. In general, SalL-Cl and SalL-HTMT systems have similar interactions for the TS state stabilization; however, Trp129 stabilizes the TS state of SalL-Cl more than SalL-HTMT, once the leaving group of halogenase reaction (L-methionine, Figure 7) is more stabilized than the",
