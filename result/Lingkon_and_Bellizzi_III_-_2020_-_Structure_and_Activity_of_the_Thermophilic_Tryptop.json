Bellizzi, III*[a] Flavin-dependent halogenases carry out regioselective aryl halide synthesis in aqueous solution at ambient temperature and neutral pH using benign halide salts, making them attrac-tive catalysts for green chemistry. BorH and BorF, two proteins encoded by the biosynthetic gene cluster for the chlorinated bisindole alkaloid borregomycin A, are the halogenase and flavin reductase subunits of a tryptophan-6-halogenase. Quan-titative conversion of l-tryptophan (Trp) to 6-chlorotryptophan could be achieved using 1.2 mol % BorH and 2 mol % BorF. The optimal reaction temperature for Trp chlorination is 45 8C, and the melting temperatures of BorH and BorF are 48 and 50 8C respectively, which are higher than the thermal parameters for most other halogenases previously studied. Steady-state kinet-ic analysis of Trp chlorination by BorH determined parameters of kcat = 4.42 min @1, and KM of 9.78 mm at 45 8C. BorH exhibits a broad substrate scope, chlorinating and brominating a variety of aromatic substrates with and without indole groups. Chlori-nation of Trp at a 100 mg scale with 52 % crude yield, using 0.2 mol % BorH indicates that industrial scale biotransforma-tions using BorH/BorF are feasible. The X-ray crystal structure of BorH with bound Trp provides additional evidence for the model that regioselectivity is determined by substrate posi-tioning in the active site, showing C6 of Trp juxtaposed with the catalytic Lys79 in the same binding pose previously ob-served in the structure of Thal. Many biologically active compounds, including natural prod-ucts,[1, 2] synthetic drugs,[3, 4] and agricultural chemicals[5] derive potency and specificity from halogen atoms. Carbon-halogen bonds are also key components of many synthetic intermedi-ates, such as aryl halides used in transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.[6, 7] Traditional synthetic methods for the preparation of organohalogen compounds suffer from lack of regioselectivity and frequently require toxic and unsustain-able reagents and solvents, though promising new \u201cgreen\u201d methods are under development.[8, 9] Flavin-dependent halo-genases (FDHs), which can regioselectively halogenate aromat-ic substrates using only halide ion and O2, have emerged as a new environmentally friendly method for aryl halide synthe-sis.[10\u201315] FDHs are closely related to flavin-dependent two-com-ponent monooxygenases[16\u201319] and consist of two proteins: a halogenase (which converts O2 and halide ion into HOCl or HOBr and water with the oxidation of FADH2 to FAD) and a smaller flavin reductase component (which reduces FAD to FADH2 using NADH). FDHs have been discovered in the biosyn-thetic pathways of bacterial and fungal natural products, where they insert chlorine or bromine into free or acyl carrier protein-bound aromatic substrates.[20] The most extensively studied halogenases (EC 1.14.19.9, 1.14.19.58, 1.14.19.59) regio-selectivity halogenate l-tryptophan on the 5, 6, or 7 positions of the indole ring, though most have the ability to halogenate other substrates as well.[21\u201328] A newly identified viral FDH has recently been shown to have iodination activity.[29] Borregomycin A (Scheme 1 A), a chlorinated bisindole alka-loid produced by oxidative dimerization of Trp, was discovered through metagenomic screening of soil samples from the Anza-Borrego desert and has antiproliferative activity against human colon cancer HCT116 cells and inhibits the kinase CaM-KIId.[30] Two genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster for borrego-mycin A, borF and borH, were predicted by sequence homolo-gy to encode the flavin reductase and halogenase components of a flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenase. BorH\u2019s predicted amino acid sequence (GenBank AGI62217, UniProtKB M9QSI0) contains a GxGxxG motif that places it in the flavin-dependent monooxygenase superfamily, along with a conserved WxWxIP motif unique to FDHs (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The crystal structure of PrnA[31] re-vealed that residues in the WxWxIP motif separate the flavin and substrate binding sites, preventing the direct reaction be-tween substrate and flavin hydroperoxide intermediate that occurs in monooxygenases. Instead, the flavin hydroperoxide is thought to oxidize chloride ion to HOCl, which traverses a 10 a tunnel to the substrate binding site, where it chlorinates the substrate in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction with the assistance of a conserved lysine (positioning the HOCl through hydrogen bonding[32] or reacting with HOCl to form a chloramine intermediate that in turn chlorinates the sub-strate[33]) and glutamate (acting as a general base). As in the two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases, the halo-genase is incapable of regenerating FADH2, and depends on the flavin reductase to reduce FAD through a diffusible flavin mechanism. FAD is released by the halogenase and diffuses to the flavin reductase, which uses NADH to reduce the FAD to FADH2, which diffuses back to the halogenase. [18, 34\u201339] BorF (GenBank AGI62216, UniProtKB M9QXS1) is the flavin reductase in the Bor gene cluster that regenerates FADH2 for BorH. The closest characterized homolog of BorH is Thal (70 % se-quence identity), a tryptophan-6-halogenase involved in thi-enodolin biosynthesis from Streptomyces albogriseolus.[24, 28, 40] The other characterized tryptophan-6-halogenases (Th-Hal,[41] SttH,[27] KtzR,[25] and Tar14[42]) share only 37\u201339 % identity with [a] K.

KGaA, Weinheim1121 ChemBioChem Communications doi.org/10.1002/cbic.201900667 BorH and are found in a more distant clade along with the tryptophan-5-halogenases AbeH and PyrH (Figure S2). BorH is more closely related to the tryptophan-7-halogenases RebH, KtzQ, and PrnA than to the tryptophan-5-halogenases and Th-Hal, SttH and KtzR. Crystal structures of the FDHs PrnA,[31] RebH,[43] PyrH,[44] and Thal[28] with bound Trp have shown that the regioselectivity of halogenation arises from the orientation of Trp in the binding site, with the hydrogen on the carbon atom closest to the con-served Lys replaced by the halogen atom. The position of the chlorine in borregomycin A strongly suggested that BorH car-ries out chlorination exclusively at C6 of the indole side chain (Scheme 1 B), converting Trp to 6-chloro-l-tryptophan (6-Cl-Trp). Because of the potential synthetic applications for enzyme-catalyzed regioselective aryl halide synthesis, many groups are engineering FDHs with improved stability and catalytic efficien-cy and with altered substrate specificity or regioselectivity for synthetic applications and generation of novel natural product analogues.[14, 15, 45\u201358] The goal of developing biocatalysts with the necessary stability for industrial scale bioconversions has motivated the identification of a halogenase from a thermo-philic bacterium,[41] as well as the engineering of thermostable RebH mutants.[59] To further expand the FDH toolkit, we have expressed and purified the halogenase BorH along with its flavin reductase BorF, verified its regioselectivity for Trp halogenation, and shown that it is able to chlorinate and brominate a variety of aromatic substrates. BorH displays a higher reaction tempera-ture and thermal stability than most previously characterized FDHs, and a pilot study showed that it is capable of bioconver-sion on a preparative scale. We also report the crystal structure of the BorH-Trp complex, which verified the structural basis for the observed regioselectivity. BorH and BorF have tryptophan halogenase and flavin reductase activity BorH and BorF were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity using affinity chro-matography and size exclusion chromatography (Figure S3). The yield of purified BorH was 4.50 mg L@1 culture and the yield of purified BorF was 4.25 mg L@1 culture. BorF copurified with bound FAD (referred to as holo-BorF), as indicated by yellow color and confirmed by electrospray ioniza-tion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. Apo-BorF could be prepared by washing column-immobilized holo-BorF with urea and KBr.[60] BorF\u2019s flavin reductase activity was observed by monitoring oxidation of NADH to NAD+ spectropho-tometrically at 340 nm (Figure 1). No depletion of NADH was observed with FAD alone or apo-BorF alone, but when apo-BorF and FAD were added, oxi-dation of NADH was observed. A small decrease in NADH was observed in the presence of holo-BorF, presumably due to a single turnover of NADH reducing the FAD copurified with BorF. BorH\u2019s Trp halogenase activity was confirmed by detection of Cl-Trp produced in an in vitro halogenation reaction (Fig-ure 2 A). Reactions containing Trp, BorH, holo-BorF and NADH were analyzed using reversed-phase (RP) HPLC to monitor (by 280 nm absorbance) disappearance of Trp (tR = 10.3 min) and appearance of a product (tR = 11.4 min) with a retention time matching that of a 6-Cl-Trp standard. The product was not ob-served in the absence of BorF, indicating that halogenation re-quires the FADH2 produced by BorF. Scheme 1. A) The chlorinated bisindole alkaloid borregomycin A. B) Reaction catalyzed In RebH and other previously characterized halogenases, a conserved lysine is essential for halogenation activity[31] Se-quence homology predicts Lys79 of BorH to be the essential lysine, and this was confirmed by the absence of product de-tected from reactions containing a BorH(K79A) mutant. ESI-MS analysis of the product identified ions at m/z 239.0574 and 241.0559 in a 3:1 intensity ratio, which matched the mass of monochlorinated Trp and the isotopic ratio of Cl (Figure S4 A). To identify the regioisomer of Cl-Trp formed, 0.8 mg of product was isolated and analyzed by 1H NMR. The results identified the product as 6-Cl-Trp (Figure S5), confirm-ing the prediction that BorH is a tryptophan-6-halogenase. Substituting NaBr for NaCl in the in vitro halogenation reac-tion led to decreased production of 6-Cl-Trp and the presence of a new peak (tR = 11.6 min) which matched the retention time for a 6-Br-Trp standard (Figure 2 B). The residual 6-Cl-Trp peak results from the presence of NaCl in the BorF storage buffer (final concentration 10 mm in the reaction). Increasing NaBr to 250 mm led to a complete disappearance of the 6-Cl-Trp peak. The product of the bromination reaction was ana-lyzed by ESI-MS and showed two peaks with m/z 283.0084 and 285.0048 in a 1:1 ratio, matching the mass and isotopic ratio for monobrominated tryptophan (Figure S4 B). BorH and BorF display elevated thermal stability and optimal reaction temperature Because thermostability is a desirable characteristic in a biocat-alyst,[41, 59] and as the Bor gene cluster was isolated from a desert soil sample,[30] we investigated the optimal reaction temperature as well as the melting temperatures of the BorH/ BorF system. BorH displayed maximum activity for Trp chlorina-tion at 45 8C (Figures 3 and S6), which is higher than the opti-mal temperature reported for other flavin-dependent halogen-ases (SttH 40 8C,[26] RebH 30\u201335 8C,[59] PrnA 30 8C,[41] Th-Hal 30 8C[41]). The melting temperature (Tm) of BorH was determined to be 48.0 8C using a ThermaFluor fluorescent dye-binding thermal stability assay[61] (Figure S7 A, C). This is similar to the reported Figure 2. BorH is a tryptophan halogenase. A) BorH converts Trp into 6-Cl-Trp; 100 mL reactions containing 3 mm BorH, 5 mm holo-BorF, 5 mm NADH, 60 mm Tm of Th-Hal (47.8 8C), a halogenase from the thermophile Streptomyces violaceusniger SPC6, and significantly higher than the Tm of RebH, PrnA, PyrH, SttH, and KtzR reported in the Th-Hal study (30\u201340 8C),[41] though the Tm of RebH has been re-ported elsewhere as 52.4 8C.[59] The Tm of BorF was determined to be 50.0 8C (Figure S7 B, D), which is similar to the thermo-philic flavin reductase Th-Fre from Bacillus subtilis WU-S2 which was identified in conjunction with Th-Hal.[41] Reaction of 0.5 mm Trp with chloride using 0.6 mol % BorH and 1 mol % holo-BorF at 45 8C reached a maximum conver-sion of 84 % after 25 minutes (Figure S8). The specific activity under these conditions was 0.089 mmol min@1 mg@1. The specif-ic activity for bromination under these conditions using 250 mm NaBr is 0.019 mmol min@1 mg@1 (21 % of the specific ac-tivity for chlorination). In comparison, 0.5 mol % of a thermo-stabilized RebH mutant halogenates 0.5 mm Trp with &60 % yield in 2 h at 49 8C[59] and 0.5 mol % Th-Hal halogenates 0.5 mm Trp with &75 % yield in 30 min at 45 8C.[41] We were able to achieve 100 % conversion of Trp to 6-Cl-Trp in a 25 min reaction at 45 8C by increasing the enzyme concentrations to 1.2 mol % BorH and 2 mol % holo-BorF. Steady-state kinetic analysis of Trp chlorination by BorH was carried out by measuring initial velocities using 3\u201335 mm Trp at 45 8C. Nonlinear fitting to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation was used to determine the kinetic parameters kcat (turnover number) = 4.42 min@1, and KM (Michaelis constant for Trp) = 9.78 mm, yielding a specificity constant (kcat/KM) of 0.45 min@1 mm@1 (Figure 4). This specificity constant is 1.8 times higher than that reported for the thermostable halogenase Th-Hal at 45 8C, 1.2 times higher than Th-Hal at 30 8C, and 2.8\u201345 times higher than that reported for PyrH, SttH, PrnA, RebH, and KtzR at 30 8C (Table S1).[41] Compared with BorH\u2019s kcat at 45 8C, Th-Hal\u2019s kcat is higher at 45 8C and approximately equal at 30 8C. Th-Hal\u2019s KM for Trp is higher at both temperatures than BorH\u2019s KM at 45 8C. Preparative scale chlorination of Trp by BorH/BorF To test the performance of BorH/BorF under conditions of higher substrate loading, 100 mg of Trp was reacted with chlo-ride using 0.2 mol % of BorH (4.5 mm BorH/2 mm Trp). We adapted our reaction conditions to include glucose dehydro-genase (GDH) as a cofactor (NADH) regeneration system.[27, 47, 48, 59] A crude yield of 52 % 6-Cl-Trp was observed after 19 h, corresponding to a total turnover number (TTN; moles product per mole enzyme) of &225. The crude yield of halogenated product produced by BorH in this pilot study was similar to previously reported yields at this scale for other halo-genases despite the use of significantly lower catalyst loading. Lysate containing 3 mol % RebH has been used to chlorinate 100 mg Trp with 74 % crude yield,[47] and SttH has been shown to chlorinate 100 mg anthranilamide with 25 % isolated yield[27] and 2.5 mol % at a 25 mg scale, Th-Hal was able to chlorinate tryptophan, N-methyltryptophan, kynurenine, anthranilic acid and anthranilamide with isolated yields of 62.5, 12, 21, 8, and 19 % respectively.[41] At a 10 mg scale, thermostabilized RebH halogenates tryptophan, 2-aminonapthalene, 2-methyltrypta-mine, and tryptoline with 69, 62, 56, and 67 % yields, respec-tively.[59] Gram scale halogenation of Trp has also been report-ed using RebH cross-linked with flavin reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase.[62] We anticipate that optimization of BorH, BorF and dehydrogenase concentrations, as well as tempera-ture and volume; will enable this yield to be further improved. BorH halogenates a variety of aromatic compounds with and without indole groups To investigate the substrate scope of BorH, we first tested its ability to halogenate the closely related metabolites 5-hydroxy-tryptophan and serotonin; 1.2 mol % BorH and 2 mol % BorF could chlorinate 0.5 mm serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptophan with 41 % and 35 % crude yield, respectively in a 1 h reaction (Figures S15 and S16), indicating that BorH is tolerant of substi-tutions to the indole group. We then expanded our approach to examine both chlorination and bromination of indole-con-taining aromatic substrates (3-indolepropionic acid, trypta-mine) and non-indole containing aromatic substrates (l-kynur-enine, anthranilamide, 6-aminoquinoline). These experiments used 0.5 mm substrate and 1.2 mol % BorH and 2 mol % BorF with 35 U mL@1 GDH as a cofactor regeneration system in 12 h reactions (Table 1, Figures 5 and S9\u2013S14). Under these condi-tions, we saw quantitative chlorination of tryptophan and 83 % bromination of Trp, and between 10\u201362 % chlorination and 4\u2013 53 % bromination of the other substrates based on crude HPLC yields (Figure 5 and Table S2). BorH halogenates serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and tryptamine much more efficiently than 3-indolepropionic acid, suggesting that the amino group of Trp is more important than the carboxylate in substrate recognition. Surprisingly, the non-indole containing substrates (kynurenine, anthranilamide, and 6-aminoquinolone) were halogenated at similar or higher levels than the non-Trp indole-containing substrates. Relative yields for chlorination and bromination varied by substrate as Figure 4. Steady-state kinetic analysis of conversion of Trp to 6-Cl-Trp by well, ranging from &2:1 for l-kynurenine and tryptamine, &1.2:1 for Trp and anthranilamide, and &1:1.2 for 6-aminoqui-noline. Based on this initial data, we can conclude that BorH is capable of halogenating indole, benzene or quinoline deriva-tives with exocyclic amino groups, but further work is necessa-ry to determine the extent of the substrate scope and the re-gioselectivity of the non-Trp halogenations. When comparing the substrate scope of BorH to that report-ed for other tryptophan-6-halogenases, we observed enhanced activity for some substrates and decreased activity for others. Relative to Th-Hal, BorH has higher activity against anthranila-mide, similar chlorination activity against 5-hydroxytryptophan, and decreased activity against l-kynurenine.[41] Thal was more effective at halogenating 6-aminoquinoline than BorH (88 % versus 34 % yield), though this may be due to higher catalyst loading and longer reaction time in the Thal study.[57] Crystal structure of BorH-Trp Crystals of BorH were grown, soaked in Trp, cryoprotected, and frozen in liquid N2. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team beamline 21-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory to 1.98 a, and the structure was determined by molecular re-placement using RebH (65 % sequence identity, PDB ID: 2OAM[33]) as a search model (Table 1). BorH crystallized in space group P21 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Each chain BorH is a single domain with 26 b-strands, 19 a-helices, six 310 helices, and one p-helix (Figures 6 A and S1). As originally observed in PrnA[31] and seen in all subsequent FDH structures,[27, 28, 33, 41, 43, 44, 59, 63] the fold comprises two subdomains: a rectangular subdomain containing a Rossmann-like fold on one end and a six-stranded mixed b-sheet on the other end spanned by several long helices, and a smaller helical pyramid-shaped subdomain composed of a5\u2013a7 and a14\u2013a18. The Trp binding site is located at the interface between the box and the pyramid, and the FAD binding site is located in the box-shaped subdomain. The BorH-Trp structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the ID: PDB ID: 6UL2. The final refined model (Rwork = 19.3 %, Rfree = 22.9 %) contains all amino acids except for 1\u20132 resi-dues at the N terminus and two residues at the C terminus of each protomer, and loop b2-b3 (resi-dues 39\u201345) in chains B, C, and D. In previously de-termined halogenase structures, this loop is involved in FAD binding and is flexible in the absence of FAD. The four BorH protomers have Ca root mean square deviations (RMSD) of between 0.19 and 0.36 a with one another (Table S3). BorH is the fifth Trp-6-halogenase to have its structure determined,[27, 28, 41, 42] but only the second (after Thal) to be solved with bound Trp. Clear elec-tron density was visible in initial maps in all four chains for the substrate Trp. The orientation of the Trp and the interactions with BorH are identical to those observed in the Trp-bound structure of Thal (Figures 6 B, C and S20 A). The Trp a-amino group forms a salt bridge with the side chain carboxylate of Glu460 and donates two H-bonds, one to the hydroxy group of Tyr453 and the other to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Phe464. The Trp carboxylate accepts H-bonds from the hydroxy group of Tyr454 and two ordered Table 1. BorH-Trp data collection and refinement statistics. water molecules, which are conserved in the structures of Thal and RebH. The more extensive interactions between BorH and the amino group relative to the carboxylate is consistent with the observed preference for halogenating tryptamine over 3-IPA. The indole nitrogen donates a H-bond to the backbone oxygen of Pro111. The binding pocket for the Trp is bounded by Val52 and Pro53 (from loop a2-b1), His109, Pro110, and Phe111 (from b8), Glu357 (on loop b26\u2013a11), Tyr453, Tyr454 (on a15), Glu460 (on a16), Phe464 and Trp465 (from loop a16\u2013a17), and Ser469 (on a17), all of which are conserved be-tween BorH and Thal. The putative catalytic residues Lys79 and Glu357 perfectly align with the corresponding residues in the other halogenase crystal structures. The common orientation of the Trp in BorH and Thal positions C6 of Trp closest to Lys79 (3.7 a away from Ne in BorH). In RebH C7 is closest to Lys79, and in PyrH C5 is closest to Lys79 (Figure 6 C). As expected from the sequence identity (65\u201370 %), the over-all tertiary structure of BorH is nearly identical that of Thal and RebH, with no significant insertions or deletions or substantial backbone differences. Chain A of BorH has a Ca root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.9 a (526 residues aligned) with Thal-Trp (PDB ID: 6H44, 70 % identity to BorH) and 1.0 a (527 residues aligned) with RebH-Trp (PDB ID: 2E4G, 65 % identity). A second cluster of structural homologues includes the Trp-5-halogenase structure PyrH-Trp (PDB ID: 2WEU), and the Trp-6-halogenase structures Th-Hal (PDB ID: 5LV9), SttH-FAD (PDB ID: 5HY5), and Tar14-FAD (PDB ID: 6NSD), which have 37\u201339 % sequence identity and Ca RMSD values of 1.4\u20131.8 a over 470\u2013 484 residues aligned. The areas that do not align well between BorH/Thal/RebH and PyrH/Th-Hal/SttH/Tar14 comprise two in-sertions in the BorH family and one insertion in the Th-Hal family, and result in a dramatic reorganization of one face of the pyramidal subdomain and a complete difference in the topology of the Trp binding site, as originally noted when the structure of PyrH was solved and compared with the structure of RebH.[44] The backbone-binding portion of the Trp binding site is made up of a topologically different insertion in the BorH family than it is in the Th-Hal family (Figure S19). The BorH in-sertion is between a14 and a17, which contains 28 residues in BorH but only 17 residues in Th-Hal/SttH/Tar14/PyrH. In BorH, this region forms two short roughly perpendicular a-helices (a15 and a16) that contact the Trp amino and carboxylate group (Tyr453, Tyr454 on a15, Glu460 on a16, and Phe464 and Trp465 on loop a16\u2013a17). In Th-Hal and related structures, the space that is occupied by this insertion in BorH is occupied by a different insertion in the Th-Hal family, which is between a7 and b11 of BorH. There are no structures of Trp bound to the Trp-6-halogenases from this family (Th-Hal, SttH, Tar14), but the Trp-bound structure of PyrH indicates that residues in this region (Gln160, Gln163) donate hydrogen bonds to the carbox-ylate of Trp. The second BorH insertion is between b5 and b8, which are the second and first strands in the seven-strand mixed b-sheet in the box-shaped subdomain. In Th-Hal, these strands are con-nected by an eight residue loop, but in BorH, there are a total of 21 residues between these two strands, including a short b-hairpin (b6-b7) that forms a flap covering one corner of the pyramidal subdomain. PrnA (59 % identity) is much closer in sequence to BorH than to the Th-Hal structural family, and contains the a14\u2013a17 inser-Figure 6. Crystal structure of BorH-Trp. A) Ribbon diagram of chain A, with tion but has a shorter b5\u2013b8 insertion lacking the b-hairpin. The PrnA-FAD-Trp structure (PDB ID: 2AQJ) has a Ca RMSD value of 1.5 a for 510 residues aligned with BorH. In summary, we have shown that BorH, which was predicted to be a tryptophan-6-halogenase based on sequence homolo-gy, not only regioselectively halogenates Trp, but is also able to chlorinate and brominate structurally distinct aromatic sub-strates. BorH and BorF (its companion flavin reductase subunit) have higher thermal stability than most halogenases, reflecting their origins in a desert soil bacterial gene cluster, and their thermal stability and relatively high optimal reaction tempera-ture are attractive characteristics in a green biocatalyst for syn-thetic applications. Production of >50 mg of 6-Cl-Trp in a pilot study using 0.2 mol % BorH indicates that BorH has sufficient stability and catalytic efficiency to be useful for preparative scale halogenation.

        "Structure and Activity of the Thermophilic Tryptophan-6 Halogenase BorH",
        "Kazi Lingkon and John J. Bellizzi, III*[a]",
        "Flavin-dependent halogenases carry out regioselective aryl halide synthesis in aqueous solution at ambient temperature and neutral pH using benign halide salts, making them attrac-tive catalysts for green chemistry. BorH and BorF, two proteins encoded by the biosynthetic gene cluster for the chlorinated bisindole alkaloid borregomycin A, are the halogenase and flavin reductase subunits of a tryptophan-6-halogenase. Quan-titative conversion of l-tryptophan (Trp) to 6-chlorotryptophan could be achieved using 1.2 mol % BorH and 2 mol % BorF. The optimal reaction temperature for Trp chlorination is 45 8C, and the melting temperatures of BorH and BorF are 48 and 50 8C respectively, which are higher than the thermal parameters for most other halogenases previously studied. Steady-state kinet-ic analysis of Trp chlorination by BorH determined parameters of kcat = 4.42 min @1, and KM of 9.78 mm at 45 8C. BorH exhibits a broad substrate scope, chlorinating and brominating a variety of aromatic substrates with and without indole groups. Chlori-nation of Trp at a 100 mg scale with 52 % crude yield, using 0.2 mol % BorH indicates that industrial scale biotransforma-tions using BorH/BorF are feasible. The X-ray crystal structure of BorH with bound Trp provides additional evidence for the model that regioselectivity is determined by substrate posi-tioning in the active site, showing C6 of Trp juxtaposed with the catalytic Lys79 in the same binding pose previously ob-served in the structure of Thal.",
        "Many biologically active compounds, including natural prod-ucts,[1, 2] synthetic drugs,[3, 4] and agricultural chemicals[5] derive potency and specificity from halogen atoms. Carbon-halogen bonds are also key components of many synthetic intermedi-ates, such as aryl halides used in transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.[6, 7] Traditional synthetic methods for the preparation of organohalogen compounds suffer from lack of regioselectivity and frequently require toxic and unsustain-able reagents and solvents, though promising new \u201cgreen\u201d methods are under development.[8, 9] Flavin-dependent halo-genases (FDHs), which can regioselectively halogenate aromat-ic substrates using only halide ion and O2, have emerged as a new environmentally friendly method for aryl halide synthe-sis.[10\u201315] FDHs are closely related to flavin-dependent two-com-ponent monooxygenases[16\u201319] and consist of two proteins: a halogenase (which converts O2 and halide ion into HOCl or HOBr and water with the oxidation of FADH2 to FAD) and a smaller flavin reductase component (which reduces FAD to FADH2 using NADH). FDHs have been discovered in the biosyn-thetic pathways of bacterial and fungal natural products, where they insert chlorine or bromine into free or acyl carrier protein-bound aromatic substrates.[20] The most extensively studied halogenases (EC 1.14.19.9, 1.14.19.58, 1.14.19.59) regio-selectivity halogenate l-tryptophan on the 5, 6, or 7 positions of the indole ring, though most have the ability to halogenate other substrates as well.[21\u201328] A newly identified viral FDH has recently been shown to have iodination activity.[29]",
        "Borregomycin A (Scheme 1 A), a chlorinated bisindole alka-loid produced by oxidative dimerization of Trp, was discovered through metagenomic screening of soil samples from the Anza-Borrego desert and has antiproliferative activity against human colon cancer HCT116 cells and inhibits the kinase CaM-KIId.[30] Two genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster for borrego-mycin A, borF and borH, were predicted by sequence homolo-gy to encode the flavin reductase and halogenase components of a flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenase.",
        "BorH\u2019s predicted amino acid sequence (GenBank AGI62217, UniProtKB M9QSI0) contains a GxGxxG motif that places it in the flavin-dependent monooxygenase superfamily, along with a conserved WxWxIP motif unique to FDHs (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The crystal structure of PrnA[31] re-vealed that residues in the WxWxIP motif separate the flavin and substrate binding sites, preventing the direct reaction be-tween substrate and flavin hydroperoxide intermediate that occurs in monooxygenases. Instead, the flavin hydroperoxide is thought to oxidize chloride ion to HOCl, which traverses a 10 a tunnel to the substrate binding site, where it chlorinates the substrate in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction with the assistance of a conserved lysine (positioning the HOCl through hydrogen bonding[32] or reacting with HOCl to form a chloramine intermediate that in turn chlorinates the sub-strate[33]) and glutamate (acting as a general base). As in the two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases, the halo-genase is incapable of regenerating FADH2, and depends on the flavin reductase to reduce FAD through a diffusible flavin mechanism. FAD is released by the halogenase and diffuses to the flavin reductase, which uses NADH to reduce the FAD to FADH2, which diffuses back to the halogenase. [18, 34\u201339] BorF (GenBank AGI62216, UniProtKB M9QXS1) is the flavin reductase in the Bor gene cluster that regenerates FADH2 for BorH.",
        "The closest characterized homolog of BorH is Thal (70 % se-quence identity), a tryptophan-6-halogenase involved in thi-enodolin biosynthesis from Streptomyces albogriseolus.[24, 28, 40] The other characterized tryptophan-6-halogenases (Th-Hal,[41] SttH,[27] KtzR,[25] and Tar14[42]) share only 37\u201339 % identity with",

        "Crystal structures of the FDHs PrnA,[31] RebH,[43] PyrH,[44] and Thal[28] with bound Trp have shown that the regioselectivity of halogenation arises from the orientation of Trp in the binding site, with the hydrogen on the carbon atom closest to the con-served Lys replaced by the halogen atom. The position of the chlorine in borregomycin A strongly suggested that BorH car-ries out chlorination exclusively at C6 of the indole side chain (Scheme 1 B), converting Trp to 6-chloro-l-tryptophan (6-Cl-Trp).",
        "Because of the potential synthetic applications for enzyme-catalyzed regioselective aryl halide synthesis, many groups are engineering FDHs with improved stability and catalytic efficien-cy and with altered substrate specificity or regioselectivity for synthetic applications and generation of novel natural product analogues.[14, 15, 45\u201358] The goal of developing biocatalysts with the necessary stability for industrial scale bioconversions has motivated the identification of a halogenase from a thermo-philic bacterium,[41] as well as the engineering of thermostable RebH mutants.[59]",
        "To further expand the FDH toolkit, we have expressed and purified the halogenase BorH along with its flavin reductase BorF, verified its regioselectivity for Trp halogenation, and shown that it is able to chlorinate and brominate a variety of aromatic substrates. BorH displays a higher reaction tempera-ture and thermal stability than most previously characterized FDHs, and a pilot study showed that it is capable of bioconver-sion on a preparative scale. We also report the crystal structure of the BorH-Trp complex, which verified the structural basis for the observed regioselectivity.",
        "BorH and BorF have tryptophan halogenase and flavin reductase activity",
        "BorH and BorF were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity using affinity chro-matography and size exclusion chromatography (Figure S3). The yield of purified BorH was 4.50 mg L@1 culture and the yield of purified BorF was 4.25 mg L@1 culture. BorF copurified with bound FAD (referred to as holo-BorF), as indicated by yellow color and confirmed by electrospray ioniza-tion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. Apo-BorF could be prepared by washing column-immobilized holo-BorF with urea and KBr.[60] BorF\u2019s flavin reductase activity was observed by monitoring oxidation of NADH to NAD+ spectropho-tometrically at 340 nm (Figure 1). No depletion of NADH was observed with FAD alone or apo-BorF alone, but when apo-BorF and FAD were added, oxi-dation of NADH was observed. A small decrease in NADH was observed in the presence of holo-BorF,",
        "presumably due to a single turnover of NADH reducing the FAD copurified with BorF.",
        "BorH\u2019s Trp halogenase activity was confirmed by detection of Cl-Trp produced in an in vitro halogenation reaction (Fig-ure 2 A). Reactions containing Trp, BorH, holo-BorF and NADH were analyzed using reversed-phase (RP) HPLC to monitor (by 280 nm absorbance) disappearance of Trp (tR = 10.3 min) and appearance of a product (tR = 11.4 min) with a retention time matching that of a 6-Cl-Trp standard. The product was not ob-served in the absence of BorF, indicating that halogenation re-quires the FADH2 produced by BorF.",
        "Scheme 1. A) The chlorinated bisindole alkaloid borregomycin A. B) Reaction catalyzed",
        "In RebH and other previously characterized halogenases, a conserved lysine is essential for halogenation activity[31] Se-quence homology predicts Lys79 of BorH to be the essential lysine, and this was confirmed by the absence of product de-tected from reactions containing a BorH(K79A) mutant.",
        "ESI-MS analysis of the product identified ions at m/z 239.0574 and 241.0559 in a 3:1 intensity ratio, which matched the mass of monochlorinated Trp and the isotopic ratio of Cl (Figure S4 A). To identify the regioisomer of Cl-Trp formed, 0.8 mg of product was isolated and analyzed by 1H NMR. The results identified the product as 6-Cl-Trp (Figure S5), confirm-ing the prediction that BorH is a tryptophan-6-halogenase.",
        "Substituting NaBr for NaCl in the in vitro halogenation reac-tion led to decreased production of 6-Cl-Trp and the presence of a new peak (tR = 11.6 min) which matched the retention time for a 6-Br-Trp standard (Figure 2 B). The residual 6-Cl-Trp peak results from the presence of NaCl in the BorF storage buffer (final concentration 10 mm in the reaction). Increasing NaBr to 250 mm led to a complete disappearance of the 6-Cl-Trp peak. The product of the bromination reaction was ana-lyzed by ESI-MS and showed two peaks with m/z 283.0084 and 285.0048 in a 1:1 ratio, matching the mass and isotopic ratio for monobrominated tryptophan (Figure S4 B).",
        "BorH and BorF display elevated thermal stability and optimal reaction temperature Because thermostability is a desirable characteristic in a biocat-alyst,[41, 59] and as the Bor gene cluster was isolated from a desert soil sample,[30] we investigated the optimal reaction temperature as well as the melting temperatures of the BorH/ BorF system. BorH displayed maximum activity for Trp chlorina-tion at 45 8C (Figures 3 and S6), which is higher than the opti-mal temperature reported for other flavin-dependent halogen-ases (SttH 40 8C,[26] RebH 30\u201335 8C,[59] PrnA 30 8C,[41] Th-Hal 30 8C[41]).",

        "Reaction of 0.5 mm Trp with chloride using 0.6 mol % BorH and 1 mol % holo-BorF at 45 8C reached a maximum conver-sion of 84 % after 25 minutes (Figure S8). The specific activity under these conditions was 0.089 mmol min@1 mg@1. The specif-ic activity for bromination under these conditions using 250 mm NaBr is 0.019 mmol min@1 mg@1 (21 % of the specific ac-tivity for chlorination). In comparison, 0.5 mol % of a thermo-stabilized RebH mutant halogenates 0.5 mm Trp with &60 % yield in 2 h at 49 8C[59] and 0.5 mol % Th-Hal halogenates 0.5 mm Trp with &75 % yield in 30 min at 45 8C.[41] We were able to achieve 100 % conversion of Trp to 6-Cl-Trp in a 25 min reaction at 45 8C by increasing the enzyme concentrations to 1.2 mol % BorH and 2 mol % holo-BorF.",
        "Steady-state kinetic analysis of Trp chlorination by BorH was carried out by measuring initial velocities using 3\u201335 mm Trp at 45 8C. Nonlinear fitting to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation was used to determine the kinetic parameters kcat (turnover number) = 4.42 min@1, and KM (Michaelis constant for Trp) = 9.78 mm, yielding a specificity constant (kcat/KM) of 0.45 min@1 mm@1 (Figure 4). This specificity constant is 1.8 times higher than that reported for the thermostable halogenase Th-Hal at 45 8C, 1.2 times higher than Th-Hal at 30 8C, and 2.8\u201345 times higher than that reported for PyrH, SttH, PrnA, RebH, and KtzR at 30 8C (Table S1).[41] Compared with BorH\u2019s kcat at 45 8C, Th-Hal\u2019s kcat is higher at 45 8C and approximately equal at 30 8C. Th-Hal\u2019s KM for Trp is higher at both temperatures than BorH\u2019s KM at 45 8C. Preparative scale chlorination of Trp by BorH/BorF",
        "To test the performance of BorH/BorF under conditions of higher substrate loading, 100 mg of Trp was reacted with chlo-ride using 0.2 mol % of BorH (4.5 mm BorH/2 mm Trp). We adapted our reaction conditions to include glucose dehydro-genase (GDH) as a cofactor (NADH) regeneration system.[27, 47, 48, 59] A crude yield of 52 % 6-Cl-Trp was observed after 19 h, corresponding to a total turnover number (TTN; moles product per mole enzyme) of &225. The crude yield of halogenated product produced by BorH in this pilot study was similar to previously reported yields at this scale for other halo-genases despite the use of significantly lower catalyst loading. Lysate containing 3 mol % RebH has been used to chlorinate 100 mg Trp with 74 % crude yield,[47] and SttH has been shown to chlorinate 100 mg anthranilamide with 25 % isolated yield[27] and 2.5 mol % at a 25 mg scale, Th-Hal was able to chlorinate tryptophan, N-methyltryptophan, kynurenine, anthranilic acid and anthranilamide with isolated yields of 62.5, 12, 21, 8, and 19 % respectively.[41] At a 10 mg scale, thermostabilized RebH halogenates tryptophan, 2-aminonapthalene, 2-methyltrypta-mine, and tryptoline with 69, 62, 56, and 67 % yields, respec-tively.[59] Gram scale halogenation of Trp has also been report-ed using RebH cross-linked with flavin reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase.[62] We anticipate that optimization of BorH, BorF and dehydrogenase concentrations, as well as tempera-ture and volume; will enable this yield to be further improved.",
        "BorH halogenates a variety of aromatic compounds with and without indole groups To investigate the substrate scope of BorH, we first tested its ability to halogenate the closely related metabolites 5-hydroxy-tryptophan and serotonin; 1.2 mol % BorH and 2 mol % BorF could chlorinate 0.5 mm serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptophan with 41 % and 35 % crude yield, respectively in a 1 h reaction (Figures S15 and S16), indicating that BorH is tolerant of substi-tutions to the indole group. We then expanded our approach to examine both chlorination and bromination of indole-con-taining aromatic substrates (3-indolepropionic acid, trypta-mine) and non-indole containing aromatic substrates (l-kynur-enine, anthranilamide, 6-aminoquinoline). These experiments used 0.5 mm substrate and 1.2 mol % BorH and 2 mol % BorF with 35 U mL@1 GDH as a cofactor regeneration system in 12 h reactions (Table 1, Figures 5 and S9\u2013S14). Under these condi-tions, we saw quantitative chlorination of tryptophan and 83 % bromination of Trp, and between 10\u201362 % chlorination and 4\u2013 53 % bromination of the other substrates based on crude HPLC yields (Figure 5 and Table S2).",
        "BorH halogenates serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and tryptamine much more efficiently than 3-indolepropionic acid, suggesting that the amino group of Trp is more important than the carboxylate in substrate recognition. Surprisingly, the non-indole containing substrates (kynurenine, anthranilamide, and 6-aminoquinolone) were halogenated at similar or higher levels than the non-Trp indole-containing substrates. Relative yields for chlorination and bromination varied by substrate as",

        "well, ranging from &2:1 for l-kynurenine and tryptamine, &1.2:1 for Trp and anthranilamide, and &1:1.2 for 6-aminoqui-noline. Based on this initial data, we can conclude that BorH is capable of halogenating indole, benzene or quinoline deriva-tives with exocyclic amino groups, but further work is necessa-ry to determine the extent of the substrate scope and the re-gioselectivity of the non-Trp halogenations.",
        "When comparing the substrate scope of BorH to that report-ed for other tryptophan-6-halogenases, we observed enhanced activity for some substrates and decreased activity for others. Relative to Th-Hal, BorH has higher activity against anthranila-mide, similar chlorination activity against 5-hydroxytryptophan, and decreased activity against l-kynurenine.[41] Thal was more effective at halogenating 6-aminoquinoline than BorH (88 % versus 34 % yield), though this may be due to higher catalyst loading and longer reaction time in the Thal study.[57]",
        "Crystal structure of BorH-Trp Crystals of BorH were grown, soaked in Trp, cryoprotected, and frozen in liquid N2. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team beamline 21-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory to 1.98 a, and the structure was determined by molecular re-placement using RebH (65 % sequence identity, PDB ID: 2OAM[33]) as a search model (Table 1). BorH crystallized in space group P21 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Each chain BorH is a single domain with 26 b-strands, 19 a-helices, six 310 helices, and one p-helix (Figures 6 A and S1). As originally observed in PrnA[31] and seen in all subsequent FDH",
        "structures,[27, 28, 33, 41, 43, 44, 59, 63] the fold comprises two subdomains: a rectangular subdomain containing a Rossmann-like fold on one end and a six-stranded mixed b-sheet on the other end spanned by several long helices, and a smaller helical pyramid-shaped subdomain composed of a5\u2013a7 and a14\u2013a18. The Trp binding site is located at the interface between the box and the pyramid, and the FAD binding site is located in the box-shaped subdomain. The BorH-Trp structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the ID: PDB ID: 6UL2. The final refined model (Rwork = 19.3 %, Rfree = 22.9 %) contains all amino acids except for 1\u20132 resi-dues at the N terminus and two residues at the C terminus of each protomer, and loop b2-b3 (resi-dues 39\u201345) in chains B, C, and D. In previously de-termined halogenase structures, this loop is involved in FAD binding and is flexible in the absence of FAD. The four BorH protomers have Ca root mean square deviations (RMSD) of between 0.19 and 0.36 a with one another (Table S3). BorH is the fifth Trp-6-halogenase to have its structure determined,[27, 28, 41, 42] but only the second (after Thal) to be solved with bound Trp. Clear elec-tron density was visible in initial maps in all four chains for the substrate Trp. The orientation of the Trp and the interactions with BorH are identical to",
        "those observed in the Trp-bound structure of Thal (Figures 6 B, C and S20 A).",
        "The Trp a-amino group forms a salt bridge with the side chain carboxylate of Glu460 and donates two H-bonds, one to the hydroxy group of Tyr453 and the other to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Phe464. The Trp carboxylate accepts H-bonds from the hydroxy group of Tyr454 and two ordered",
        "Table 1. BorH-Trp data collection and refinement statistics.",
        "water molecules, which are conserved in the structures of Thal and RebH. The more extensive interactions between BorH and the amino group relative to the carboxylate is consistent with the observed preference for halogenating tryptamine over 3-IPA. The indole nitrogen donates a H-bond to the backbone oxygen of Pro111. The binding pocket for the Trp is bounded by Val52 and Pro53 (from loop a2-b1), His109, Pro110, and Phe111 (from b8), Glu357 (on loop b26\u2013a11), Tyr453, Tyr454 (on a15), Glu460 (on a16), Phe464 and Trp465 (from loop a16\u2013a17), and Ser469 (on a17), all of which are conserved be-tween BorH and Thal.",
        "The putative catalytic residues Lys79 and Glu357 perfectly align with the corresponding residues in the other halogenase crystal structures. The common orientation of the Trp in BorH and Thal positions C6 of Trp closest to Lys79 (3.7 a away from Ne in BorH). In RebH C7 is closest to Lys79, and in PyrH C5 is closest to Lys79 (Figure 6 C).",
        "As expected from the sequence identity (65\u201370 %), the over-all tertiary structure of BorH is nearly identical that of Thal and RebH, with no significant insertions or deletions or substantial backbone differences. Chain A of BorH has a Ca root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.9 a (526 residues aligned) with Thal-Trp (PDB ID: 6H44, 70 % identity to BorH) and 1.0 a (527 residues aligned) with RebH-Trp (PDB ID: 2E4G, 65 % identity).",
        "A second cluster of structural homologues includes the Trp-5-halogenase structure PyrH-Trp (PDB ID: 2WEU), and the Trp-6-halogenase structures Th-Hal (PDB ID: 5LV9), SttH-FAD (PDB ID: 5HY5), and Tar14-FAD (PDB ID: 6NSD), which have 37\u201339 % sequence identity and Ca RMSD values of 1.4\u20131.8 a over 470\u2013 484 residues aligned. The areas that do not align well between BorH/Thal/RebH and PyrH/Th-Hal/SttH/Tar14 comprise two in-sertions in the BorH family and one insertion in the Th-Hal family, and result in a dramatic reorganization of one face of the pyramidal subdomain and a complete difference in the topology of the Trp binding site, as originally noted when the structure of PyrH was solved and compared with the structure of RebH.[44]",
        "The backbone-binding portion of the Trp binding site is made up of a topologically different insertion in the BorH family than it is in the Th-Hal family (Figure S19). The BorH in-sertion is between a14 and a17, which contains 28 residues in BorH but only 17 residues in Th-Hal/SttH/Tar14/PyrH. In BorH, this region forms two short roughly perpendicular a-helices (a15 and a16) that contact the Trp amino and carboxylate group (Tyr453, Tyr454 on a15, Glu460 on a16, and Phe464 and Trp465 on loop a16\u2013a17). In Th-Hal and related structures, the space that is occupied by this insertion in BorH is occupied by a different insertion in the Th-Hal family, which is between a7 and b11 of BorH. There are no structures of Trp bound to the Trp-6-halogenases from this family (Th-Hal, SttH, Tar14), but the Trp-bound structure of PyrH indicates that residues in this region (Gln160, Gln163) donate hydrogen bonds to the carbox-ylate of Trp.",
        "The second BorH insertion is between b5 and b8, which are the second and first strands in the seven-strand mixed b-sheet in the box-shaped subdomain. In Th-Hal, these strands are con-nected by an eight residue loop, but in BorH, there are a total of 21 residues between these two strands, including a short b-hairpin (b6-b7) that forms a flap covering one corner of the pyramidal subdomain.",
        "PrnA (59 % identity) is much closer in sequence to BorH than to the Th-Hal structural family, and contains the a14\u2013a17 inser-",
        "Figure 6. Crystal structure of BorH-Trp. A) Ribbon diagram of chain A, with",
        "tion but has a shorter b5\u2013b8 insertion lacking the b-hairpin. The PrnA-FAD-Trp structure (PDB ID: 2AQJ) has a Ca RMSD value of 1.5 a for 510 residues aligned with BorH.",
        "In summary, we have shown that BorH, which was predicted to be a tryptophan-6-halogenase based on sequence homolo-gy, not only regioselectively halogenates Trp, but is also able to chlorinate and brominate structurally distinct aromatic sub-strates. BorH and BorF (its companion flavin reductase subunit) have higher thermal stability than most halogenases, reflecting their origins in a desert soil bacterial gene cluster, and their thermal stability and relatively high optimal reaction tempera-ture are attractive characteristics in a green biocatalyst for syn-thetic applications. Production of >50 mg of 6-Cl-Trp in a pilot study using 0.2 mol % BorH indicates that BorH has sufficient stability and catalytic efficiency to be useful for preparative scale halogenation.",
