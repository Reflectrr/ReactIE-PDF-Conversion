The haloge-nated natural products associated with the symbiont were characterized from each sample, revealing that each species contained either chlorinated peptides, brominated diphenyl ethers, or no halogenated com-pounds. Analysis of the host sponges and the symbi-onts indicated that each species of sponge contained a distinct strain of morphologically similar cyanobac-teria. Although cospeciation may be present in this group, we have identified that at least one host switching event has occurred in this symbiosis. Only the strain of O. spongeliae in the sponge containing the chlorinated compounds possessed genes in-volved in the biosynthesis of chlorinated leucine pre-cursors, indicating that the chemical variation ob-served in these animals has a genetic foundation. Introduction The marine sponge Lamellodysidea herbacea (= Dysi-dea herbacea, Order Dictyoceratida) is often found in shallow waters of the Indo-Pacific. The consistent as-sociation of this sponge and other related sponges with the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria spongel-iae has been frequently observed [1\u20134]. O. spongeliae is an intercellular symbiont that is found in the sponge mesohyl (connective tissue between epithelial tissues), and accounts for 30%\u201350% of the tissue volume in these sponges. Research has shown that the cyano-bacterium fixes carbon through photosynthesis [5], and *Correspondence: mhaygood@ucsd.edu 5 Deceased. probably transfers organic carbon to the host. It has been proposed by natural product chemists that O. spongeliae might play another role in the symbiosis by producing halogenated natural products that have been isolated from the sponge. These compounds include chlori-nated amino derivatives such as dysidenin (1) and dysi-deathiazole (2) [6] that contain a trichloromethyl func-tionality on leucine-derived precursors and are very similar to pseudodysidenin (3) and barbamide (4), which have been isolated from the marine cyanobacter-ium Lyngbya majuscula (Figure 1) [7, 8]. Dysideathia-zole analogs are fish-feeding deterrents to the lunar wrasse, Thalassoma lunare, and therefore these chlori-nated metabolites may support the symbiosis in that manner [9]. Other specimens of L. herbacea along with Lamellodysidea chlorea (= Dysidea chlorea) and Phyl-lospongia spp. did not have the chlorinated peptides but contained antibacterial brominated diphenyl ethers such as 5\u20137 (Figure 1) [10\u201312]. This class of compounds had been isolated from unrelated organisms such as the green alga Cladophora fascicularis (8, Figure 1) [13] and an unidentified sponge in the family Callyspongii-dae (Order Haplosclerida) [14], and so were also thought more likely to be produced by a symbiont than the marine invertebrates themselves. Experimental support for these hypotheses was gained when Unson and Faulkner investigated a speci-men of L. herbacea which contained the chlorinated metabolite 13-demethylisodysidenin (9, Figure 1) and were able to separate the autofluorescent cyanobac-terium from the sponge cells using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Chemical examination revealed that only O. spongeliae contained the chlori-nated metabolite, and therefore was likely the source of the compound [15]. Using a Percoll density gradient to separate dissociated sponge and cyanobacterial cells from L. herbacea, others have shown that the chlorinated diketopiperazines 10 and 11 (Figure 1) were also only found in the cyanobacterium [16]. A further cell separation study conducted on a specimen of L. her-bacea containing the brominated diphenyl ether (12, Figure 1) demonstrated that only O. spongeliae con-Chemistry & Biology 398 Figure 1.

Since this is not the case, it appears that only one or the other gene cluster is present. As these biosynthetic pathways yield such similar natural products, it is pos-sible that one gene cluster was derived from the other through the gain or loss of an alanine NRPS module. This event could have occurred in O. spongeliae in the recent past and would result in the chemical diversity ob-served in these cyanobacteria. Another possibility is that the ancestral strain had both gene clusters and evolutionary pressure only required the production of one of the compounds, and the ability to produce both natural products was recently lost. No sample from Pa-lau was ever found that contained both dysideathiazole and dysidenin analogs when nine total specimens of L. herbacea collected over a period of three years were analyzed, providing further support that only one or the other compound is produced. Significance The chemical and molecular investigations of four dictyoceratid sponges from Palau provide insight into the symbiosis that these marine invertebrates main-tain with a filamentous cyanobacterium, Oscillatoria spongeliae. Instead of one ubiquitous cyanobacter-ium selectively producing either chlorinated peptides or brominated diphenyl ethers, it appears that the four sponge species contain their own genetically distinct strains of which only one strain can produce the chlorinated secondary metabolites. Within this strain, there is biosynthetic variability indicated by the presence of one of two sets of biosynthetic genes and either the chlorinated compound dysideathiazole and its analogs or the chlorinated metabolite dysi-denin and its derivatives. This indicates that the strain contains just one chlorinated peptide encoding gene cluster despite having identical small subunit 16S rRNA gene and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase rpoC1 sequence, and cannot produce both com-pounds. This result raises the question of whether gain or loss of an alanine NRPS module resulted in formation of the two gene clusters, or whether the ancestral strain lost the ability to produce both chlori-nated peptides. The phylogeny of the O. spongeliae strains when compared to the host sponges suggests that host switching can occur, providing further infor-mation about the complex nature of this symbiosis. This study has demonstrated the utility of analyzing the ultrastructure of the symbionts, characterizing the natural products that are present, and probing bio-synthetic capabilities when investigating the evolu-tionary relationships of microbial symbiosis with ma-rine invertebrates. As found here, morphologically similar symbionts can be identified that vary in their ability to produce secondary metabolites and there-fore fulfill different roles in their environments. Experimental Procedures Sponge Collection and Description Specimens of the dictyoceratid marine sponges Lamellodysidea herbacea (Keller, 1889; family Dysideidae), Lamellodysidea chlorea (de Laubenfels, 1954), Lendenfeldia chondrodes (de Laubenfels, 1954; family Thorectidae), and Phyllospongia papyracea (Esper, 1806; family Thorectidae) were collected from four reef sites using SCUBA in the Republic of Palau. Site 1 was at West Channel Buoy 5 (07\u00b032.33#N, 134\u00b028.30#E) at a depth of 15\u201320 ft, site 2 was an inner reef entrance to Ngatpaet (07\u00b027.94#N, 134\u00b037.65#E) at a depth 45 ft, site 3 was at seamount 2 in the KB channel (07\u00b020.30#N, 134\u00b031.07#E) at a depth of 45 ft, and site 4 was in Ngerechong channel (07\u00b006.90#N, 134\u00b022.78#E) at a depth of 20 ft. While collecting care was taken to ensure that the entire sample was one piece so that no sample contained more than one species. Full taxonomic descriptions of Lamellodysidea herbacea, Lamel-lodysidea chlorea, and Lendenfeldia chondrodes have been pre-viously reported [26]. The species Phyllospongia papyracea was fully redescribed by Bergquist et al. [27]. L. herbacea and L. chlorea are gray to green-gray in coloration, grow in sheets on reefs or rocks, and have a ridged surface structure (Figures 2A\u20132B). L. chon-drodes is yellow to yellow-green in coloration, grows in a spreading sheet on the reef with numerous vertical fingers, and has a smooth surface (Figure 2C). P. papyracea varies in coloration from blue-green to golden-yellow, grows in sheets on reefs or rock, and has a smooth surface (Figures 2D\u20132F). Identification of these four spe-cies requires analysis of fiber structure and organization, choano-cyte chamber structure, mesohyl texture and histology, and mor-phology of the sponge surface. The Dysidea sp. (Dysidea cf. pallascens, Schmidt, 1862; Order Dictyoceratida, family Dysideidae) was found at a site locally known as Wonder Channel (7\u00b010.83#N, 134\u00b021.67E) at a depth of 13 min, Hyrtios erectus (Keller, 1889; Order Dictyoceratida, family Thorectidae) was collected at a depth of 3 min from a small lagoon at Ngermeuangel Island (07\u00b020.27#N, 134\u00b027.43E), and Chelo-naplysilla delicata (Pulitzer-Finali and Pronzato, 1999; Order Den-droceratida, family Darwinellidae) was collected from site 3. The Dysidea sp. (Figure 2G) is probably new to science, and unlikely to be conspecific with the Mediterranean population of D. pallascens. Nevertheless, it resembles D. pallascens closely in external mor-phology, growth form, and surface characteristics, but a compre-hensive revision of the massive, erect, and ramose species of Dysi-dea is required to place this species accurately. Hyrtios erectus (Figure 2H) is a black upright conulose sponge found growing on rock or coral [26], and Chelonaplysilla delicata (Figure 2I) is a gray frilly sponge with a smooth surface found growing on reefs or rock [28]. Voucher specimens have been deposited in the SIO Benthic Invertebrate Collection for all the sponges in this study (P1192\u2013 P1203), and vouchers of the Dysidea sp. (QM G316990) and Chelo-naplysilla delicata (QM G316991) were deposited at the Queensland Museum repository as well. Chemical Analysis For each specimen of L. herbacea, L. chlorea, P. papyracea, and L. chondrodes considered in this study, 14\u201340 g of sponge was frozen immediately after collection and stored at -20\u00b0C until ex-traction. The sponges were individually lyophilized, extracted with methanol (3 \u00d7 100 ml), dried in vacuo, and partitioned between ethyl acetate and water to obtain the organic extracts of each sam-ple (80 mg to 1 g). 1H NMR spectra on the extracts were recorded in CDCl3 on a Varian Gemini 400 MHz spectrometer, and gradient COSY experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 300 MHz NMR spectrometer. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis was performed on each extract using a Hewlet Packard series 1100 mass spectrometer and an Agilent C18 analyti-cal HPLC column (Figure 7). Molecular ions of the chlorinated com-pounds were obtained in the positive detection mode, and were found for the brominated metabolites in the negative mode. Only two brominated diphenyl ethers were present in the LC/MS traces of P. papyracea, but analysis of the 1H NMR spectra revealed the presence of a third which was not detected. This compound was isolated by chromatography of the organic extract on silica gel (200\u2013430 mesh) using 10% ethyl acetate/hexane as the eluent, and was identified as 7 (Figure 1) based on comparison of spectral data with the authentic compound [11]. Since dysidenin and isodysi-denin are epimers (Figure 1) that have similar 1H NMR spectra and identical MS data, the extract containing dysidenin was subjected Chemistry & Biology 404 to HPLC using a Varian preparative C18 column with a gradient of p f50% ACN/H2O to 100% ACN to yield the pure compound. The opti-cal rotation of the natural product was obtained using a Rudolph G (Research Autopol III polarimeter. The measured [\u03b1]D -95.2\u00b0 (c 0.66, CHCl3) was consistent with the reported value for dysidenin, [\u03b1]D p C-98\u00b0, and not isodysidenin, [\u03b1]D +47\u00b0 [7]. T wDNA Isolation and Sponge Gene PCR DNA was isolated from sponge tissue from each sample stored in t fRNAlater (Ambion) at -20\u00b0C using the animal tissue protocol of a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). In all cases, the optional RNase treatment was f scarried out. Since PCR inhibitors were present, the isolated DNA was further purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). e cThe D3 variable loop of the 28S rRNA of the host species was amplified using D3A and D3B primers [29], and the ITS-2 was am-n tplified with the primers SP58bF and SP28cR [20]. Twenty-five mi-croliter PCR reactions were performed for both genes using Taq D bDNA polymerase (Promega) with a 1 min denaturing step at 95\u00b0C followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and 72\u00b0C s dfor 1.5 min. For each sample, 4\u20136 PCR reactions were carried out to minimize PCR errors and later combined. i P r16S rRNA Gene Clone Library Analysis Using the eubacterial primers 27F and the 1492R [30] and the high-fidelity DNA polymerase pfu turbo (Stratagene), 50 Nonel PCR reac-S tions were carried out on genomic DNA from each specimen of H L. herbacea, L. chlorea, L. chondrodes, and P. papyracea. The re-f action conditions were a 1 min denaturing step at 95\u00b0C followed k by 25 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and 72\u00b0C for s 2 min. In an attempt to minimize heteroduplex formation, recondi-H tioning PCR [31] was then performed on each sample by running H another 50 Nonel PCR reaction using pfu turbo and 5 Nonel of obtained f PCR product as the DNA template. The PCR conditions were ( 3 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min. t These \u201creconditioned\u201d PCR products were then purified using a i PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen), and adenylated through incubating of a the PCR product at 72\u00b0C for 10 min with Taq DNA polymerase and o dATP. This adenylated product was cloned directly into a pCR4-i TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into chemically H competent TOP10 E. coli (Invitrogen) following Invitrogen\u2019s instruc-D tion manual. The 16S rRNA gene inserts in the resulting colonies p were amplified directly from E. coli cells using the T3 and T7 prim-w ers provided in the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). The PCR con-u ditions were as follows: 25 Nonel reactions using Taq polymerase, r 1 min 95\u00b0C denaturing step followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for b 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min. The clone libraries o were screened by incubating the PCR products with RsaI (Invitro-n gen), MspI (NEB), and EcoRI (NEB) for a period of 3 hr. Seventeen a to twenty-seven clones were screened from the three samples of t L. herbacea for a total of 66, while 25 clones were screened from L. chlorea. From the two samples of L. chondrodes, 19 and 34 Sclones were screened. Thirty-one to forty clones were screened Ffrom the three samples of P. papyracea for a total of 107. One re-Pstriction fragment digestion pattern was recognized on a 1.2% aagarose gel for each sample which accounted for 63%\u201397% of the Aclones recovered from the four species. Plasmids were isolated qusing a QIAprep Miniprep kit (Qiagen), and sequenced using the T3 Sand T7 plasmid primers as well as internal 338F [32] and 536R [33] n16S rRNA gene primers. At least two clones of the dominant apattern were sequenced from each sponge for a total of 9 from dL. herbacea, 2 from L. chlorea, 4 from L. chondrodes, and 7 from P. papyracea. The sequences were identified as O. spongeliae Pbased on their identity to posted O. spongeliae sequences when Fcompared to other bacteria using the basic local alignment search ftool (BLAST) [34]. Since no variation was detected within a sponge 1sample, one sequence from each species was used to represent cthe 16S rRNA gene of the symbiont. At least one clone of the minor (restriction digest patterns were sequenced from each sample, iwhich were from other bacteria not related to O. spongeliae based fon BLAST and ribosomal database project (RDP-II) searches [35]. t vBiosynthetic Gene PCR dUsing primers designed to amplify barB1 and barB2 homologs, all 9 sponge samples containing O. spongeliae were screened for the c resence of those genes through attempted PCR amplification rom genomic DNA. The barB1 primers were BarB1-S-NdeI (5#-GAATTCCATATGAAAACTAGGGCAAAAGCTG-3#) and B-Hali-AS-1 5#-CCGCTCGAGCTGTCCCAAAGGTCGTCTAAT-3#), and the barB2 rimers were B-Halii-S-1 (5#-GGAATTCCATATGAAAACTATCACTG TGAAC-3#) and B-Halii-AS-1 (5#-CCCCTCGAGCAGAGGTTGTC CACTTTG-3#). These primers have restriction digest sites which ere not considered in the subsequent analysis. The PCR condi-ions for both sets of primers were a 1 min denaturing step at 95\u00b0C ollowed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 45\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and 72\u00b0C or 1.5 min. For the barB1 primers, PCR products of the appropriate ize were obtained from genomic DNA from all the sponges. How-ver, the sequence data obtained from the sponges that did not ontain the chlorinated peptides were of poor quality and clearly ot barB1 homologs. Further PCR experiments conducted under he same PCR conditions using B-Hali-AS-1 and an internal primer ysB1-S-1 (5#-ATTGAGTTGTGGCAGGAAATTAG-3#) designed to ind to dysB1 homologs resulted in the expected PCR product for ponges that contained the chlorinated compounds, and no pro-uct for those which did not. To rule out the presence of PCR inhib-tors in those samples where barB homologs were not amplified, CR reactions were carried out on the samples using 16S and 28S RNA gene primers and the expected amplicons were obtained. eparation of Host and Cyanobacterial DNA igh molecular weight (HMW) DNA, 30\u201350 kb in size, was isolated rom tissue stored in RNAlater using a Blood and Cell Culture DNA it Midi (Qiagen). Yields ranged from 30\u201375 Noneg per sample of ponge containing O. spongeliae, of which the entire amount of MW DNA was added to a 53% CsCl solution with 13 Noneg/ml oechst 33258 dye (EMD Biosciences). Centrifugation was per-ormed on a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge using a VTi65 rotor Beckman) at 267,000 \u00d7 g (55,000 rpm) at 20\u00b0C for 24 hr. Two dis-inct bands were achieved for each sample of sponge; these were ndividually extracted from the gradient with an 18 gauge needle nd syringe. The Hoechst dye was removed through 2 extractions f water-saturated n-butanol, and the DNA was precipitated with -propanol, washed with 70% EtOH, resuspended in 10 mM tris-Cl (pH 8.5), and vortexed at maximum speed for 0.5 min. From NA isolated from the lower band, 25 Nonel PCR reactions using the ublished C-terminal and N-terminal (X = G) rpoC1 primers [23] ere carried out 4 to 6 times per sample to minimize PCR errors sing Taq polymerase and combined afterwards. No product of the ight size was obtained from PCR on DNA isolated from the upper and. The conditions were a 1 min 95\u00b0C step followed by 35 cycles f 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min. It was ecessary to excise the appropriate band from a 1.2% agarose gel, nd purify the DNA from the agarose using a QIAquick gel extrac-ion kit (Qiagen) prior to sequencing. equencing or sequencing, all PCR products were purified using a Qiaquick CR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using both forward nd reverse primers. All sequencing was performed on an ABI 3100 nalyzer using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator kit. All DNA se-uences obtained were assembled and checked by eye using equencher 4.0.5 (Gene Codes Corp.). The GenBank accession umbers for the DNA sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis re AY613960\u2013AY613983 and AY615501\u2013AY615518, and for the ysB genes are AY628171\u2013AY628174. hylogenetic Analysis of Sponge Sequence or Figures 3 and 5A, the 5.8S, ITS-2, and 28S sequences obtained rom the Palauan sponges were combined, aligned using Clustal X .83 [36], and checked by eye. Composite phylogenetic trees were onstructed using Mr. Bayes 3.0 [37] and the maximum parsimony MP) algorithm in PAUP 4.0b10 [24] with the sequence data divided nto an rRNA (all 5.8S and 28S sequence) and ITS-2 partitions. De-ault priors were used for the Bayesian analysis, and the general ime reversible (GTR) model was used with a \u03b3 distribution of rate ariation across sites. The partitions were unlinked to allow for in-ependent estimations of likelihood. Four markov chain monte arlo (MCMC) chains were run for three million generations sam-Speciation and Symbiont Secondary Metabolism 405 pling every 100, and the first 2000 trees were discarded. For MP analysis, transversions were weighted 3 times transitions (maxi-mum likelihood estimation of ratio), the partitions rRNA:ITS2 were weighted 3:1 in the analysis, and a 10 replicate heuristic search with random addition of sequences was completed. Bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 replicates. For Figure 5B, the tree was constructed using sequence obtained using the SP58bF-SP28cR primer set (no D3 sequence available from Guam sponges). Otherwise, the analysis was the same as Figure 5A. Phylogenetic Analysis of O. spongeliae Sequence For Figure 5A, composite phylogenetic trees for the Oscillatoria strains were constructed based on the 16S rRNA gene and rpoC1 sequence using Mr. Bayes and MP (PAUP) with the data partitioned into 4 blocks: 16S rRNA and rpoC1 divided into 3 (first position, second position, and third position). The Bayesian analysis was carried out with unlinked partitions excluding the third position of the rpoC1 gene using the GTR model and \u03b3 distribution across sites. Four MCMC chains were run for three million generations, sampling every 100 with the first 2000 trees rejected from the analysis. For the MP phylogeny, transversions were weighted 2 times transitions, the partitions were weighted 2:2:3:1 (16S, first position, second position, and third position), and a heuristic search with 10 replicates was performed with sequences added randomly. Bootstrap analysis was conducted using 1000 replicates. For Figure 5B, the tree was constructed with 16S rRNA gene se-quence (no rpoC1 sequence available from Guam symbionts), and no partitioning and weighting of the data was employed. Otherwise the same methodology was employed as in Figure 5A. The GTR model with \u03b3 distribution across sites was used (in agreement with the Bayesian analysis) for the maximum likelihood estimations of constrained and unconstrained trees. Phylogenetic Analysis of Biosynthetic Gene Sequence The gene sequences were aligned using Clustal X, and corrected based on comparison to the alignment of the protein sequences encoded by these genes. The phylogenetic trees for the hypotheti-cal/putative halogenase sequences were constructed using Mr. Bayes and MP (PAUP) with the data partitioned into 3 blocks (first position, second position, and third position). The Bayesian analy-sis was carried out with unlinked partitions excluding the 3rd posi-tion of the codon using the GTR model and \u03b3 distribution across sites. Four MCMC chains were run for three million generations sampling every 100 with the first 2000 trees rejected from the analysis. For the MP phylogeny, transversions were not weighted to transitions based on the likelihood estimation. The codon positions were weighted 2:3:1 (first position, second position, and third posi-tion), and a heuristic search with 10 replicates was performed with sequences added randomly. Bootstrap analysis was conducted using 1000 replicates.

        "Summary",
        "Four species of marine sponges (Phylum Porifera, Or-der Dictyoceratida), which contain the filamentous cy-anobacterial symbiont Oscillatoria spongeliae, were collected from four locations in Palau. The haloge-nated natural products associated with the symbiont were characterized from each sample, revealing that each species contained either chlorinated peptides, brominated diphenyl ethers, or no halogenated com-pounds. Analysis of the host sponges and the symbi-onts indicated that each species of sponge contained a distinct strain of morphologically similar cyanobac-teria. Although cospeciation may be present in this group, we have identified that at least one host switching event has occurred in this symbiosis. Only the strain of O. spongeliae in the sponge containing the chlorinated compounds possessed genes in-volved in the biosynthesis of chlorinated leucine pre-cursors, indicating that the chemical variation ob-served in these animals has a genetic foundation.",
        "Introduction",
        "The marine sponge Lamellodysidea herbacea (= Dysi-dea herbacea, Order Dictyoceratida) is often found in shallow waters of the Indo-Pacific. The consistent as-sociation of this sponge and other related sponges with the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria spongel-iae has been frequently observed [1\u20134]. O. spongeliae is an intercellular symbiont that is found in the sponge mesohyl (connective tissue between epithelial tissues), and accounts for 30%\u201350% of the tissue volume in these sponges. Research has shown that the cyano-bacterium fixes carbon through photosynthesis [5], and",
        "*Correspondence: mhaygood@ucsd.edu 5 Deceased. probably transfers organic carbon to the host. It has been proposed by natural product chemists that O. spongeliae might play another role in the symbiosis by producing halogenated natural products that have been isolated from the sponge. These compounds include chlori-nated amino derivatives such as dysidenin (1) and dysi-deathiazole (2) [6] that contain a trichloromethyl func-tionality on leucine-derived precursors and are very similar to pseudodysidenin (3) and barbamide (4), which have been isolated from the marine cyanobacter-ium Lyngbya majuscula (Figure 1) [7, 8]. Dysideathia-zole analogs are fish-feeding deterrents to the lunar wrasse, Thalassoma lunare, and therefore these chlori-nated metabolites may support the symbiosis in that manner [9]. Other specimens of L. herbacea along with Lamellodysidea chlorea (= Dysidea chlorea) and Phyl-lospongia spp. did not have the chlorinated peptides but contained antibacterial brominated diphenyl ethers such as 5\u20137 (Figure 1) [10\u201312]. This class of compounds had been isolated from unrelated organisms such as the green alga Cladophora fascicularis (8, Figure 1) [13] and an unidentified sponge in the family Callyspongii-dae (Order Haplosclerida) [14], and so were also thought more likely to be produced by a symbiont than the marine invertebrates themselves.",
        "Experimental support for these hypotheses was gained when Unson and Faulkner investigated a speci-men of L. herbacea which contained the chlorinated metabolite 13-demethylisodysidenin (9, Figure 1) and were able to separate the autofluorescent cyanobac-terium from the sponge cells using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Chemical examination revealed that only O. spongeliae contained the chlori-nated metabolite, and therefore was likely the source of the compound [15]. Using a Percoll density gradient to separate dissociated sponge and cyanobacterial cells from L. herbacea, others have shown that the chlorinated diketopiperazines 10 and 11 (Figure 1) were also only found in the cyanobacterium [16]. A further cell separation study conducted on a specimen of L. her-bacea containing the brominated diphenyl ether (12, Figure 1) demonstrated that only O. spongeliae con-",

        "the same regardless of which compound was produced, with the areas of divergence in the sequence present as ambiguous sequence in the sequence chromatograms. Since this is not the case, it appears that only one or the other gene cluster is present. As these biosynthetic pathways yield such similar natural products, it is pos-sible that one gene cluster was derived from the other through the gain or loss of an alanine NRPS module. This event could have occurred in O. spongeliae in the recent past and would result in the chemical diversity ob-served in these cyanobacteria. Another possibility is that the ancestral strain had both gene clusters and evolutionary pressure only required the production of one of the compounds, and the ability to produce both natural products was recently lost. No sample from Pa-lau was ever found that contained both dysideathiazole and dysidenin analogs when nine total specimens of L. herbacea collected over a period of three years were analyzed, providing further support that only one or the other compound is produced.",
        "Significance",
        "The chemical and molecular investigations of four dictyoceratid sponges from Palau provide insight into the symbiosis that these marine invertebrates main-tain with a filamentous cyanobacterium, Oscillatoria spongeliae. Instead of one ubiquitous cyanobacter-ium selectively producing either chlorinated peptides or brominated diphenyl ethers, it appears that the four sponge species contain their own genetically distinct strains of which only one strain can produce the chlorinated secondary metabolites. Within this strain, there is biosynthetic variability indicated by the presence of one of two sets of biosynthetic genes and either the chlorinated compound dysideathiazole and its analogs or the chlorinated metabolite dysi-denin and its derivatives. This indicates that the strain contains just one chlorinated peptide encoding gene cluster despite having identical small subunit 16S rRNA gene and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase rpoC1 sequence, and cannot produce both com-pounds. This result raises the question of whether gain or loss of an alanine NRPS module resulted in formation of the two gene clusters, or whether the ancestral strain lost the ability to produce both chlori-nated peptides. The phylogeny of the O. spongeliae strains when compared to the host sponges suggests that host switching can occur, providing further infor-mation about the complex nature of this symbiosis.",
        "This study has demonstrated the utility of analyzing the ultrastructure of the symbionts, characterizing the natural products that are present, and probing bio-synthetic capabilities when investigating the evolu-tionary relationships of microbial symbiosis with ma-rine invertebrates. As found here, morphologically similar symbionts can be identified that vary in their ability to produce secondary metabolites and there-fore fulfill different roles in their environments. Experimental Procedures Sponge Collection and Description Specimens of the dictyoceratid marine sponges Lamellodysidea herbacea (Keller, 1889; family Dysideidae), Lamellodysidea chlorea (de Laubenfels, 1954), Lendenfeldia chondrodes (de Laubenfels, 1954; family Thorectidae), and Phyllospongia papyracea (Esper, 1806; family Thorectidae) were collected from four reef sites using SCUBA in the Republic of Palau. Site 1 was at West Channel Buoy 5 (07\u00b032.33#N, 134\u00b028.30#E) at a depth of 15\u201320 ft, site 2 was an inner reef entrance to Ngatpaet (07\u00b027.94#N, 134\u00b037.65#E) at a depth 45 ft, site 3 was at seamount 2 in the KB channel (07\u00b020.30#N, 134\u00b031.07#E) at a depth of 45 ft, and site 4 was in Ngerechong channel (07\u00b006.90#N, 134\u00b022.78#E) at a depth of 20 ft. While collecting care was taken to ensure that the entire sample was one piece so that no sample contained more than one species.",
        "Full taxonomic descriptions of Lamellodysidea herbacea, Lamel-lodysidea chlorea, and Lendenfeldia chondrodes have been pre-viously reported [26]. The species Phyllospongia papyracea was fully redescribed by Bergquist et al. [27]. L. herbacea and L. chlorea are gray to green-gray in coloration, grow in sheets on reefs or rocks, and have a ridged surface structure (Figures 2A\u20132B). L. chon-drodes is yellow to yellow-green in coloration, grows in a spreading sheet on the reef with numerous vertical fingers, and has a smooth surface (Figure 2C). P. papyracea varies in coloration from blue-green to golden-yellow, grows in sheets on reefs or rock, and has a smooth surface (Figures 2D\u20132F). Identification of these four spe-cies requires analysis of fiber structure and organization, choano-cyte chamber structure, mesohyl texture and histology, and mor-phology of the sponge surface.",
        "The Dysidea sp. (Dysidea cf. pallascens, Schmidt, 1862; Order Dictyoceratida, family Dysideidae) was found at a site locally known as Wonder Channel (7\u00b010.83#N, 134\u00b021.67E) at a depth of 13 min, Hyrtios erectus (Keller, 1889; Order Dictyoceratida, family Thorectidae) was collected at a depth of 3 min from a small lagoon at Ngermeuangel Island (07\u00b020.27#N, 134\u00b027.43E), and Chelo-naplysilla delicata (Pulitzer-Finali and Pronzato, 1999; Order Den-droceratida, family Darwinellidae) was collected from site 3. The Dysidea sp. (Figure 2G) is probably new to science, and unlikely to be conspecific with the Mediterranean population of D. pallascens. Nevertheless, it resembles D. pallascens closely in external mor-phology, growth form, and surface characteristics, but a compre-hensive revision of the massive, erect, and ramose species of Dysi-dea is required to place this species accurately. Hyrtios erectus (Figure 2H) is a black upright conulose sponge found growing on rock or coral [26], and Chelonaplysilla delicata (Figure 2I) is a gray frilly sponge with a smooth surface found growing on reefs or rock [28]. Voucher specimens have been deposited in the SIO Benthic Invertebrate Collection for all the sponges in this study (P1192\u2013 P1203), and vouchers of the Dysidea sp. (QM G316990) and Chelo-naplysilla delicata (QM G316991) were deposited at the Queensland Museum repository as well.",
        "Chemical Analysis For each specimen of L. herbacea, L. chlorea, P. papyracea, and L. chondrodes considered in this study, 14\u201340 g of sponge was frozen immediately after collection and stored at -20\u00b0C until ex-traction. The sponges were individually lyophilized, extracted with methanol (3 \u00d7 100 ml), dried in vacuo, and partitioned between ethyl acetate and water to obtain the organic extracts of each sam-ple (80 mg to 1 g). 1H NMR spectra on the extracts were recorded in CDCl3 on a Varian Gemini 400 MHz spectrometer, and gradient COSY experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 300 MHz NMR spectrometer. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis was performed on each extract using a Hewlet Packard series 1100 mass spectrometer and an Agilent C18 analyti-cal HPLC column (Figure 7). Molecular ions of the chlorinated com-pounds were obtained in the positive detection mode, and were found for the brominated metabolites in the negative mode. Only two brominated diphenyl ethers were present in the LC/MS traces of P. papyracea, but analysis of the 1H NMR spectra revealed the presence of a third which was not detected. This compound was isolated by chromatography of the organic extract on silica gel (200\u2013430 mesh) using 10% ethyl acetate/hexane as the eluent, and was identified as 7 (Figure 1) based on comparison of spectral data with the authentic compound [11].

The PCR condi-ions for both sets of primers were a 1 min denaturing step at 95\u00b0C ollowed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 45\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and 72\u00b0C or 1.5 min. For the barB1 primers, PCR products of the appropriate ize were obtained from genomic DNA from all the sponges. How-ver, the sequence data obtained from the sponges that did not ontain the chlorinated peptides were of poor quality and clearly ot barB1 homologs. Further PCR experiments conducted under he same PCR conditions using B-Hali-AS-1 and an internal primer ysB1-S-1 (5#-ATTGAGTTGTGGCAGGAAATTAG-3#) designed to ind to dysB1 homologs resulted in the expected PCR product for ponges that contained the chlorinated compounds, and no pro-uct for those which did not. To rule out the presence of PCR inhib-tors in those samples where barB homologs were not amplified, CR reactions were carried out on the samples using 16S and 28S RNA gene primers and the expected amplicons were obtained. eparation of Host and Cyanobacterial DNA igh molecular weight (HMW) DNA, 30\u201350 kb in size, was isolated rom tissue stored in RNAlater using a Blood and Cell Culture DNA it Midi (Qiagen). Yields ranged from 30\u201375 Noneg per sample of ponge containing O. spongeliae, of which the entire amount of MW DNA was added to a 53% CsCl solution with 13 Noneg/ml oechst 33258 dye (EMD Biosciences). Centrifugation was per-ormed on a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge using a VTi65 rotor Beckman) at 267,000 \u00d7 g (55,000 rpm) at 20\u00b0C for 24 hr. Two dis-inct bands were achieved for each sample of sponge; these were ndividually extracted from the gradient with an 18 gauge needle nd syringe. The Hoechst dye was removed through 2 extractions f water-saturated n-butanol, and the DNA was precipitated with -propanol, washed with 70% EtOH, resuspended in 10 mM tris-Cl (pH 8.5), and vortexed at maximum speed for 0.5 min. From NA isolated from the lower band, 25 Nonel PCR reactions using the ublished C-terminal and N-terminal (X = G) rpoC1 primers [23] ere carried out 4 to 6 times per sample to minimize PCR errors sing Taq polymerase and combined afterwards. No product of the ight size was obtained from PCR on DNA isolated from the upper and. The conditions were a 1 min 95\u00b0C step followed by 35 cycles f 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 0.5 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min. It was ecessary to excise the appropriate band from a 1.2% agarose gel, nd purify the DNA from the agarose using a QIAquick gel extrac-ion kit (Qiagen) prior to sequencing. equencing or sequencing, all PCR products were purified using a Qiaquick CR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using both forward nd reverse primers. All sequencing was performed on an ABI 3100 nalyzer using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator kit. All DNA se-uences obtained were assembled and checked by eye using equencher 4.0.5 (Gene Codes Corp.). The GenBank accession umbers for the DNA sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis re AY613960\u2013AY613983 and AY615501\u2013AY615518, and for the ysB genes are AY628171\u2013AY628174. hylogenetic Analysis of Sponge Sequence or Figures 3 and 5A, the 5.8S, ITS-2, and 28S sequences obtained rom the Palauan sponges were combined, aligned using Clustal X .83 [36], and checked by eye. Composite phylogenetic trees were onstructed using Mr. Bayes 3.0 [37] and the maximum parsimony MP) algorithm in PAUP 4.0b10 [24] with the sequence data divided nto an rRNA (all 5.8S and 28S sequence) and ITS-2 partitions. De-ault priors were used for the Bayesian analysis, and the general ime reversible (GTR) model was used with a \u03b3 distribution of rate ariation across sites. The partitions were unlinked to allow for in-ependent estimations of likelihood. Four markov chain monte arlo (MCMC) chains were run for three million generations sam-",

For MP analysis, transversions were weighted 3 times transitions (maxi-mum likelihood estimation of ratio), the partitions rRNA:ITS2 were weighted 3:1 in the analysis, and a 10 replicate heuristic search with random addition of sequences was completed. Bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 replicates. For Figure 5B, the tree was constructed using sequence obtained using the SP58bF-SP28cR primer set (no D3 sequence available from Guam sponges). Otherwise, the analysis was the same as Figure 5A. Phylogenetic Analysis of O. spongeliae Sequence For Figure 5A, composite phylogenetic trees for the Oscillatoria strains were constructed based on the 16S rRNA gene and rpoC1 sequence using Mr. Bayes and MP (PAUP) with the data partitioned into 4 blocks: 16S rRNA and rpoC1 divided into 3 (first position, second position, and third position). The Bayesian analysis was carried out with unlinked partitions excluding the third position of the rpoC1 gene using the GTR model and \u03b3 distribution across sites. Four MCMC chains were run for three million generations, sampling every 100 with the first 2000 trees rejected from the analysis. For the MP phylogeny, transversions were weighted 2 times transitions, the partitions were weighted 2:2:3:1 (16S, first position, second position, and third position), and a heuristic search with 10 replicates was performed with sequences added randomly. Bootstrap analysis was conducted using 1000 replicates. For Figure 5B, the tree was constructed with 16S rRNA gene se-quence (no rpoC1 sequence available from Guam symbionts), and no partitioning and weighting of the data was employed. Otherwise the same methodology was employed as in Figure 5A. The GTR model with \u03b3 distribution across sites was used (in agreement with the Bayesian analysis) for the maximum likelihood estimations of constrained and unconstrained trees. Phylogenetic Analysis of Biosynthetic Gene Sequence The gene sequences were aligned using Clustal X, and corrected based on comparison to the alignment of the protein sequences encoded by these genes. The phylogenetic trees for the hypotheti-cal/putative halogenase sequences were constructed using Mr. Bayes and MP (PAUP) with the data partitioned into 3 blocks (first position, second position, and third position). The Bayesian analy-sis was carried out with unlinked partitions excluding the 3rd posi-tion of the codon using the GTR model and \u03b3 distribution across sites. Four MCMC chains were run for three million generations sampling every 100 with the first 2000 trees rejected from the analysis. For the MP phylogeny, transversions were not weighted to transitions based on the likelihood estimation. The codon positions were weighted 2:3:1 (first position, second position, and third posi-tion), and a heuristic search with 10 replicates was performed with sequences added randomly. Bootstrap analysis was conducted using 1000 replicates.",
