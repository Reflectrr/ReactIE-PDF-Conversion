Metabolic engineering and heterologous expression methods can be applied to improve desired metabolite produc-tion, when their biosynthesis pathways have been revealed. And, stable supplement is a necessary basis of bioactivity mechanism discovery and following clinical trial. Aspergillus terreus is an outstanding producer of many bioac-tive agents, and a large part of them are polyketides. In this review, we took polyketides from A. terreus as examples, focusing on 13 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes in A. terreus NIH 2624 genome. The biosynthesis pathways of nine PKS genes have been reported, and their downstream metabolites are lovastatin, terreic acid, terrein, geodin, terretonin, citreoviridin, and asperfuranone, respectively. Among them, lovastatin is a well-known hypolipidemic agent. Terreic acid, terrein, citreoviridin, and asperfuranone show good bioactivities, especially anticancer activities. On the oth-er hand, geodin and terretonin are mycotoxins. So, biosynthesis gene cluster information is important for the pro-duction or elimination of them. We also predicted three pos-sible gene clusters that contain four PKS genes by homolo-gous gene alignment with other Aspergillus strains. We think that this is an effective way to mine secondary metabolic gene clusters. Keywords Polyketide .Aspergillus terreus . Biosynthesis pathway . Gene cluster . Heterologous expression Introduction Filamentous fungi are talented producers used for thousands of years, and they have attracted increasing attention over the past half century (Papagianni 2004). In East Asia, there are lots of traditional fermented food, for example, Aspergillus oryzae is used in rice wine production (Zhang et al. 2012), and Monascus is used in the production of fermented bean curd (Jiang et al. 2011). Purified fungal metabolites can be important medicines. Penicillin and cephalosporin (Abraham et al. 1953; Newton and Abraham 1955), two famous antibi-otics derived from filamentous fungi, have saved the lives of many infected people. Hypolipidemic agent lovastatin pro-duced by Aspergillus terreus (Askenazi et al. 2003) and im-munosuppressant cyclosporine A produced by Tolypocladium inflatum (Survase et al. 2011) are also typical pharmaceutical products from filamentous fungi. Nowadays, more and more novel natural products have been discovered from filamentous fungi. In the latest report, over 400 new compounds were derived from marine fungi in 2014 (Blunt et al. 2016). However, there is a long way between new compound and pharmaceutical agent. The compound must be stably supplied to meet the need of bioactivity assay and following clinical trial (Leal et al. 2014). And to produce a compound more * Ying Yin yy1047@126.com * Yuanxing Zhang yxzhang@ecust.edu.cn 1 State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China 2 Marine Biotechnology Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200240, China 3 Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center for Biomanufacturing, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:7787\u20137798 DOI 10.1007/s00253-016-7733-z effectively, we should better figure out its biosynthesis path-way. In a word, in the way from new compound to pharma-ceutical agent, much more need to be known besides its struc-ture. On the other hand, these information will also be helpful in the re-evaluation of known compounds. In this review, we take polyketides from A. terreus as ex-amples and summarize the information of their bioactivities, biosynthesis pathways, and production enhancement methods. This knowledge is helpful for the utilization of this filamentous fungus. As mentioned above, A. terreus has a famous polyketide product lovastatin; moreover, many bioac-tive polyketides have been isolated from A. terreus, such as terreic acid, terrein, geodin, terretonin, citreoviridin, asperfuranone, and so on. Additionally, the strain A. terreus NIH 2624 was sequenced by the Broad Institute as part of the Broad Fungal Genome Initiative in 2005, and the data are publicly available through the Broad Institute and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (Guo and Wang 2014). Completed genomic information assists re-searchers to find out the polyketide pathways in A. terreus. It was reported that there were 28 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, one hybrid PKS/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene, and two PKS-like genes in A. terreus NIH 2624 genome (Khaldi et al. 2010). Here, we will focus on 13 PKS genes, corresponding gene clusters, and their related secondary metabolites (see Table 1). Lovastatin Hypolipidemic agent lovastatin works as inhibitor of (3S)-hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR), that reduces HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is the key step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, statins were found to be anticancer agents (Chan et al. 2003). Malignant gliomas are highly dependent on the mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of lipid moieties critical to cell rep-lication; thus, it is uniquely vulnerable to the growth arrest by lovastatin (Prasanna et al. 1996). In a latest study, lovastatin also exerts anticancer effect on the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Yang et al. 2016). So, lova-statin may have other applications besides lowering cholesterol. The lovastatin (3) cluster has been well summarized. There are two highly reducing PKSs (HR-PKSs), LovB (lovastatin nonaketide synthase, ATEG_09961) and LovF (lovastatin diketide synthase, ATEG_09968), in its cluster (Hill 2006; Cox 2007; Campbell and Vederas 2010; Chiang et al. 2010a; Chooi and Tang 2012). As shown in Fig. 1a, dihydromonacolin L acid (1) is pro-duced by LovB and a trans-acting enoyl reductase (ER) LovC (ATEG_09963), then released by a thioesterase (TE) LovG (ATEG_09962) (Xu et al. 2013). Next, d ihydromonacol in L acid is oxidized by LovA (ATEG_09960) twice to form monacolin J acid (2). 2-Methylbutyrate moiety of lovastatin is synthesized by an-other HR-PKS LovF, and the covalent attachment of this moiety to 2 is catalyzed by a transesterase LovD (ATEG_09964) (Guo and Wang 2014). Nowadays, lova-statin is not the most frequently consumed statin; some semisynthetic statins like simvastatin are much more pop-ular. Since simvastatin differs from lovastatin in the side chain and LovD is responsible for the attachment of side chain to monacolin J acid, thus the efforts to engineer LovD were carried out (Jim\u00e9nez-Os\u00e9s et al. 2014). A mu-tant LovD containing 29 point mutations was generated by a directed evolution strategy; consequently, the protein efficiency in the synthesis of simvastatin was improved by about 1000-fold. Therefore, the knowledge of biosynthe-sis pathway is not only constructive for the production enhancement of its own product but also can facilitate connected semisynthetic drug production. Terreic acid and 6-methylsalicylic acid Terreic acid shows antibacterial activity (Yamamoto et al. 1980). Bacterial cell wall biosynthetic enzymes UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (MurA) (Sch\u00f6nbrunn et al. 2010) and N-acetylglucosamine-1-Table 1 Seven reported PKS gene clusters in A. terreus NIH 2624 PKS gene Biosynthetic gene cluster Downstream metabolites ATEG_09961 ATEG_09960\u201309964, 09966, 09968 Lovastatin ATEG_09968 ATEG_06275 ATEG_06272\u201306278, 06280 Terreic acid ATEG_00145 ATEG_00135\u201300145 Terrein ATEG_08451 ATEG_08449\u201308460 Geodin ATEG_10080 ATEG_10077\u201310086 Terretonin ATEG_09617 ATEG_09616\u201309620 Citreoviridin ATEG_07659 ATEG_07659\u201307667 Asperfuranone ATEG_07661 7788 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:7787\u20137798 phosphate-uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate-acetyl-transferase (GlmU) (Sharma et al. 2016) were found to be its molecular targets. But, its selective inhibition against the cata-lytic activity of Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (Btk) attracted more attention (Kawakami et al. 1999), so it could be a chemical probe to examine the function of Btk and a potential agent for rheumatoid arthritis, lymphoma, and other diseases (Pan 2008). About half a century ago, isotope labeling experiments showed that the biosynthesis of terreic acid (6) originated from 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA, 4) (Read and Vining 1968). And, 6-MSA synthase (6-MSAS) gene is one of the best characterized fungal PKS gene. This partly reduc-ing PKS (PR-PKS) was first reported in Penicillium patulum (Dimroth et al. 1970). In A. terreus NIH 2624, the homologous gene is atX (ATEG_06275) (Fujii et al. 1996). The heterologous expression of 6-MSA can be a judgment standard for the expression system of fungal polyketides. For instance, in the recombinant Pichia pastoris GS115-NpgA-ATX with Aspergillus nidulans and phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene npgA and atX, 2.2 g l-1 production of 6-MSA could be obtained, which suggested that P. pastoris was a potential host (Gao et al. 2013). In 2014, Boruta and Bizukojc (2014) speculated the terreic acid cluster by bioinformatic analysis, and it was finally experimentally characterized by Guo et al. (2014) by using a targeted gene deletion method in the same year. The cluster contains a total of eight genes: atA\u2013G and X (ATEG_06272\u201306278, 06280). As shown in Fig. 1b, AtA (ATEG_06272) is a hypothetical salicylate hydroxylase and catalyzes a decarboxylative hydroxyl-ation of 6-MSA. Sometimes, this catechol-type intermedi-ate will be oxidatively ring-opened and results in a shunt product (2Z,4E)-2-methyl-2,4-hexadienedioic acid. AtE (ATEG_06277) and AtG (ATEG_06280) are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, possibly catalyze further hydrox-ylation. And, the hydroxylation may trigger intramolecu-lar rearrangement like the condition in fungal tropolone biosynthesis (Davison et al. 2012). The function of AtD (ATEG_06276) is still unknown, but terreic acid cannot be biosynthesized without the presence of AtD, so maybe, it is involved in the epoxidation to gain terremutin (5). At last, GMC oxidoreductase AtC (ATEG_06274) catalyzes the oxidation of 5 to give the final product terreic acid (6). AtF (ATEG_06278) and AtB (ATEG_06273) are tran-scription factor and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, respectively. Fig. 1 Biosynthesis of lovastatin (a) and terreic acid (b) in A. terreus NIH 2624 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:7787\u20137798 7789 Terrein Terrein shows potential anticancer activities in a series of re-searches, inhibiting multidrug-resistant breast cancer (Liao et al. 2012), cervical carcinoma (Porameesanaporn et al. 2013), prostate cancer (Arakawa et al. 2008), ovarian cancer (Chen et al. 2014), and hepatoma (Zhang et al. 2015). And, it has several different mechanisms, including inhibiting angiogenin secretion, inducing apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. Terrein (9) is a polyketide metabolite, which was con-firmed by isotope labeling study in 1960s (Birch et al. 1965), and its precursor 6-hydroxymellein (6-HM) had also been identified that way (Hill et al. 1981). On the other hand, the terrein cluster (ATEG_00135\u201300145) was serendipitously characterized in the effort to explore the biosynthesis pathway of conidial pigment in A. terreus recently (Zaehle et al. 2014). As shown in Fig. 2, the nonreducing PKS (NR-PKS) gene terA (ATEG_00145) has flexibility in controlling the length of the polyketide chain. Three different metabolites could be obtained in the heterologous expression of terA in Aspergillus niger (Zaehle et al. 2014); among them, 2,3-dehydro-6-HM (7) is a pentaketide like 6-HM (8). The formation of 8 needs another protein TerB (ATEG_00144), which is a multidomain protein with ketoreductase (KR) and dehydratase (DH) func-tions. When C-9 ketone is reduced by TerB, 8 can be easily derived by lactonization, while the cyclization in 7 is a bit different, which may need an intramolecular rearrangement that occurs in the biosynthesis of citrinin in Monascus (He and Cox 2016). The dehydration may also be catalyzed by TerB. TerC-F (ATEG_00140\u201300143) may be involved in the unusual contraction of the aryl ring, but the specific roles of these genes await further verification. We speculate that FAD-dependent monooxygenases TerC and TerD (ATEG_00142\u2013 143) catalyze hydroxylation and trigger oxidative dearomatization, similar to the key step of sorbicillinoid and tropolone biosynthesis (Davison et al. 2012; Fahad et al. 2014), also somewhat like the aforementioned condition in terreic acid biosynthesis. Hill et al. (1981) suggested that a ring contraction then happened, in contrast to the ring expan-sion in tropolone biosynthesis (Davison et al. 2012). Lastly, the extra carbon atoms may be removed by decarboxylation. TerG and TerJ (ATEG_00135, 00138) are MFS transporters, and the function of TerH\u2013I (ATEG_00136\u201300137) is not clear. Terrein production will decrease but not disappear in the ab-sence of them. Amusingly, we find a similar gene cluster (GAQ03937\u201303946) in the genome of Aspergillus lentulus strain IFM 54703, which also contains these unnecessary genes. Enough supply of glucose and citrate, which are favorable for polyketide biosynthesis, can improve terrein production (Yin et al. 2012, 2013). Furthermore, terrein is thought to play a role in fungus-plant interactions and ecological competition. Fig. 2 Biosynthesis of terrein in A. terreus NIH 2624 7790 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:7787\u20137798 The nitrogen response regulators AreA and AtfA and the iron response regulator HapX are upstream regulators of the terrein transcription factor TerR (ATEG_00139), which can regulate terrein biosynthesis (Gressler et al. 2015a). High production of terrein was achieved in two marine A. terreus strains, which were 7\u223c8 g l-1 in shake flask (Yin et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016) and 9 g l-1 in bioreactor (Xiao et al. 2013). Because of the high yield of terrein, the transcription factor TerR is also thought to be a new high-performance heterologous fungal expression system regulatory element (Gressler et al. 2015b). Geodin and emodin Geodin is a kind of mycotoxin (Br\u00e4se et al. 2009) that always simultaneously biosynthesized with lovastatin (Bizukojc and Ledakowicz 2007; Abd Rahim et al. 2015). Since they are both polyketides, modification of media does not have a good effect on removing geodin; the knowledge of their gene clus-ters can offer a better guidance. A. terreus produces series of yellow anthraquinone pig-ments, such as emodin and questin, but these yellow pigments disappeared when a NR-PKS gene was deleted (Couch and Gaucher 2004). In A. terreus NIH 2624, this PKS (ATEG_08451) was then named as atrochrysone carboxylic acid synthase (ACAS), and the polyketide product needs to be released with the aid of atrochrysone carboxyl ACP thioesterase (ACTE) encoded by ATEG_08450 (Awakawa et al. 2009). A small amount of emodin (11) could be obtained from in vitro reactions catalyzed by ACAS and ACTE, while the main product was atrochrysone (10), which was probably derived by spontaneous decarboxylation of the polyketide product. Much more emodin was gained from in vivo heter-ologous expression experiment in A. oryzae, which suggested that more genes should be involved in emodin biosynthesis. In fact, emodin is also an intermediate; many other metab-olites can be derived from this polyketide pathway, such as questin (12), sulochrin (13), geodin (15), and asterric acid (Couch and Gaucher 2004; Boruta and Bizukojc 2016). In 2013, Nielsen et al. (2013) transferred putative geodin gene cluster (ATEG_08449\u201308460) from A. terreus NIH 2624 to an expression platform in A. nidulans and gained geodin suc-cessfully. Proposed biosynthesis pathway for geodin is shown in Fig. 3a. Except ACAS (GedC) and ACTE (GedB), dihydrogeodin oxidase GedJ (ATEG_08458) that catalyzed the conversion of dihydrogeodin (14) to geodin (15) was pre-viously reported (Huang et al. 1995). The functions of the transcription factor GedR (ATEG_08453) responsible for the activation of geodin cluster and the halogenase GedL (ATEG_08460) that catalyzed the conversion of sulochrin (13) to dihydrogeodin (14) were verified by Nielsen\u2019s study. Meanwhile, similar gene clusters are also found in Aspergillus fumigatus (Afu4g14450\u201314580) and Aspergillus fischerianus (101790\u2013101920), without the presence of halogenase gene, which further substantiates the delineation of the geodin clus-ter (Nielsen et al. 2013). As a result, their putative product is trypacidin (Larsen et al. 2007), which differs from geodin only in the absence of chlorines and the presence of an additional methyl group. Furthermore, emodin is also a universal precur-sor of cladofulvin (Griffiths et al. 2016) andmonodictyphenone (Chiang et al. 2010b). Terretonin Mycotoxin terretonin is a kind of meroterpenoids that origi-nate from both polyketide and terpenoid pathways (McIntyre et al. 1989). The NR-PKS gene trt4 (ATEG_10080) is respon-sible for the biosynthesis of 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid (DMOA, 16). And, a farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is trans-ferred by a prenyltransferase Trt2 (ATEG_10078) to form farnesyl-DMOA (17) (Guo et al. 2012; Itoh et al. 2012). The whole gene cluster contains 10 genes (ATEG_10077\u201310086); the other genes catalyze following steps, e.g., methylation, epoxidation, and cyclization. The methylation of the carboxyl group catalyzed by Trt5 (ATEG_10081) is an essential step for cyclization (Matsuda et al. 2012). Then, epoxidation and cy-clization are catalyzed by epoxidase Trt8 (ATEG_10085) and terpene cyclase Trt1 (ATEG_10077), respectively. Next, short-chain dehydrogenase Trt9 (ATEG_10086) and FAD-dependent monooxygenase Trt3 (ATEG_10079) are involved to yield terrenoid (18). The last few steps of the terretonin pathway have been elucidated byMatsuda et al. (2015) recent-ly. They uncovered the unusual D-ring construction in terretonin biosynthesis by collaboration of a multifunctional cytochrome P450 Trt6 (ATEG_10083) and a unique isomer-ase Trt14 (ATEG_10082). Trt6 catalyzes three successive ox-idations to transform 18 into an unstable intermediate, which then undergoes the D-ring expansion and unusual rearrange-ment of the methoxy group catalyzed by Trt14 to afford the core skeleton of terretonin (19). Finally, the nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase Trt7 (ATEG_10084) accomplishes the last two oxidation steps to complete the biosynthesis (see Fig. 3b). Homologous genes can be also found in A. nidulans, but they locate in two different clusters and are responsible for the biosynthesis of austinol and dehydroaustinol (Lo et al. 2012). Citreoviridin Citreoviridin is an ATP synthase inhibitor that inhibits mito-chondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Suh and Wilcox 1988). It can uncompetitively inhibit ATP hydrolysis and ATP syn-thesis by binding to the\u03b2-subunit of F1-ATPase (Sayood et al. 1989). Ectopic ATP synthase is an accessible molecular target Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:7787\u20137798 7791 for inhibiting HIV-1 proliferation in vivo, and citreoviridin can completely block antigen-presenting cell (APC)-mediated transfer of HIV-1 at the APC-target cell interaction step (Yavlovich et al. 2012). Ectopic ATP synthase is also a target for lung adenocarcinoma; blockade like citreoviridin can sup-presses cancer growth by activating the unfolded protein re-sponse (Chang et al. 2012). Citreoviridin (20) is a HR-PKS product confirmed by iso-tope labeling experiments in 1980s (Steyn et al. 1982), and its gene cluster is identified this year by resistance gene-driven genome mining (Lin et al. 2016). Lin et al. search for extra copies of the F1-ATPase\u03b2-subunit in the genome ofA. terreus NIH 2624 and find one gene (ATEG_09616) that is located next to a HR-PKS gene CtvA (ATEG_09617). Additionally, a methyltransferase CtvB (ATEG_09618), a hydrolase CtvD (ATEG_09619), and a flavin-dependent monooxygenase CtvC (ATEG_09620) are found in the locus. They are putative tailoring enzymes required for the synthesis of the tetrahydrofuran ring and methylated \u03b1-pyrone in citreoviridin (see Fig. 4a). Lin et al. heterologously expressed citreoviridin biosynthetic gene cluster in A. nidulans successfully. Similar cluster can be also found in Metarhizium anisopliae, which was known to produce analogous toxin aurovertin (Azumi et al. 2008). The self-resistance gene is an effective guidepost; in fact, an extra copy of HMGR can also be found in the lovastatin biosynthetic locus. Asperfuranone Asperfuranone was proved to inhibit proliferation of human nonsmall cell lung cancer A549 cells via blocking cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis (Wang et al. 2010). There are two PKS genes in the asperfuranone cluster just like the lovastatin cluster: One is HR-PKS gene, and the other is NR-PKS gene with a C-terminus reductive domain (NR-PKS-R). Fig. 3 Biosynthesis of geodin (a) and terretonin (b) in A. terreus NIH 2624 7792 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:7787\u20137798 In fact, asperfuranone cluster (AN1029\u20131036) and its prod-ucts were firstly identified in A. nidulans (Chiang et al. 2009). Then, a similar cluster (ATEG_07659\u201307667) was also found in A. terreus NIH 2624, and asperfuranone was successfully produced through heterologous expression of this cluster in A. nidulans (Chiang et al. 2013). As shown in Fig. 4b, the polyketide intermediate produced by HR-PKS gene AteafoG (ATEG_07659) may be transferred to NR-PKS AteafoE (ATEG_07661) with the aid of AteafoC (ATEG_07663) to give the complete polyketide (21). Two steps of hydroxylation are then catalyzed by AteafoD (ATEG_07662) and AteafoF (ATEG_07660), respectively. The hydroxylation of C-3 on the benzene ring results in intramolecular rearrangement, and a furan nucleus is formed by the latter step. Last, the authors inferred that there existed an endogenous reductase in A. nidulans to catalyze the final conversion to asperfuranone (22). Three predicted PKS clusters The gene clusters of another four PKS genes (ATEG_03432, 03446, 03629, 08662) are still not clear, but there are some hints, so we try to give the prediction of their gene clusters in this review. ATEG_03432 and ATEG_08662 are both NR-PKS-R genes like ateafoE (ATEG_07661). NR-PKS-R genes are always involved in the biosynthesis of azaphilones, such as citrinin (He and Cox 2016). So, the products of the clusters of ATEG_03432 and ATEG_08662 are probable to be azaphilones. The heterologous expression of NR-PKS gene ATEG_03629 in A. nidulans results in the production of 5-methyl orsellinic acid (5-MOA, 25) (Chiang et al. 2013), sim-ilar to the product of trt4 (ATEG_10080). Moreover, the use of methyl orsellinic acid as a starting material is widely ob-served in other fungal pathways, such as tropolones (Davison et al. 2012) and xenovulene (Bailey et al. 2007). There is a fatty acid synthetase (FAS) gene pair (ATEG_08867 and 08868) that occurs near the NR-PKS-R gene ATEG_08662. Just l ike the condit ion of asperfuranone cluster, a highly homologous gene cluster can be found in A. nidulans (AN3379\u20133386) (see Table 2). Ahuja et al. (2012) activated the A. nidulans clus-ter by exchanging the promoters of PKS and FAS genes with controllable alcA promoter and isolated a major prod-uct, 2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl-6-(2-oxoundecyl) benzalde-hyde (23) along with other corresponding products from the mycelium (see Fig. 5a). In particular, a decanoyl starter unit is firstly synthesized by the FAS and then loaded onto PKS. We speculate that similar products can be derived from A. terreus cluster. On the other hand, heterologous expression of these three PKS and FAS genes in A. nidulans resulted in no product (Chiang et al. 2013). Therefore, loading of the starter unit may need other genes in the predicted cluster. And, the monooxygenase Fig. 4 Biosynthesis of citreoviridin (a) and asperfuranone (b) in A. terreus NIH 2624 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:7787\u20137798 7793 (ATEG_08666) may catalyze the benzene ring hydroxyl-ation that results in intramolecular rearrangement. Boruta and Bizukojc (2014) speculated that ATEG_03432 was responsible for the biosynthesis of citrinin in A. terreus. But, the heterologous expression of ATEG_03432 in A. nidulans did not result in the precursor of citrinin but the precursor of Monascus azaphilone pigment (24) (Chiang et al. 2013). Although they have similar structure and biosynthesis pathways, they are different in the length of polyketide chain and the number of methyl groups. Instead of the FAS gene pair that occurred in the Monascus azaphilone pigment biosynthesis cluster (Balakrishnan et al. 2013; Balakrishnan et al. 2014), there is a HR-PKS gene ATEG_03446 near to ATEG_03432. Will there be a gene cluster between ATEG_03432 and ATEG_03446? In fact, similar gene clusters azaA\u2013L and R (EHA28230\u201328239, Fig. 5 Predicted biosynthesis processes involve PKS genes ATEG_08662 (a), ATEG_03432 and 03446 (b), and ATEG_03629 (c) in A. terreus NIH 2624 Table 2 Proposed gene cluster contains PKS gene ATEG_08662 Locus tag A. nidulans homolog Putative function Protein identity (%) ATEG_08662 AN3386 NR-PKS-R 56 ATEG_08663 AN3385 Transcription factor 67 ATEG_08664 AN3384 Condensation 44 ATEG_08665 AN3383 MFS transporter 65 ATEG_08666 AN3382 Salicylate monooxygenase 56 ATEG_08667 AN3381 FAS\u03b2 51 ATEG_08668 AN3380 FAS\u03b1 60 ATEG_08669 AN3379 Unknown 43 7794 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2016) 100:7787\u20137798 28242\u201328244) can be observed in A. niger ATCC 1015 genome, which is responsible for azanigerone biosynthesis (Zabala et al. 2012), another kind of azaphilones. NR-PKS azaA shows 50 % identity with ATEG_03432 and has the same product of ATEG_03432. HR-PKS azaB shows 33 % identity with ATEG_03446. Moreover, homologs of azaC, G\u2013J, L, and R also can be found between ATEG_03432 and ATEG_03446 (see Table 3 and Fig. 5b). Among them, N-terminus of ATEG_03443 shows 38 % identity with azaJ, and its C-terminus shows 55 % identity with azaH, so there may be two genes in ATEG_03443, and we differentiate them as ATEG_03443-1 and ATEG_03443-2. AzaH was proved to be occupied in the pyran-ring formation of azanigerones (Zabala et al. 2012); thus, ATEG_03443-2 may have the same important function, somewhat like the function of AteafoD (ATEG_07662). ATEG_03445 is a Zn2Cys6 regulator lo-cated next to HR-PKS ATEG_03446 and shows 40 % identity with azaR, the activator of azanigerone cluster; hence, it is suggested to be the transcriptional factor of the cluster. Consequently, we conjecture that there is a gene cluster between ATEG_03432 and ATEG_03446, and its product may be an analog of azanigerone. Heterologous expression of ATEG_03629 and the next NRPS-like gene ATEG_03630 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that ATEG_03630 could reduce 5-MOA to 2,4-dihydroxy 5,6-dimethyl benzaldehyde (26) (Wang et al. 2014). The function of the NRPS-like gene is to some extent similar to the R domain in the afore-mentioned NR-PKS-R genes. Interestingly, engineering of the adenylation domain of this NRPS-like protein can achieve a potential biocatalyst for aldehyde genera-tion (Wang and Zhao 2014). Homologous genes of ATEG_03629 and 03630 can be found in A. nidulans, which are AN6448 and AN6444, respectively. Similar gene pairs also exist in the genome of Stachybotrys (Li et al. 2016). Furthermore, cytochrome P450 ATEG_03631 shows 49 % identity with AN6449, and short-chain dehydrogenase ATEG_03632 shows 54 % identity with AN6450 (see Table 4). The product of AN6448 is 3-methyl orsellinic acid (3-MOA), different in the location of methyl group.

When 6-methyl is oxidized to aldehyde, the isoindolinone core in cichorine can be formed spontaneously in the pres-ence of ammonium ions (Yuuichi et al. 2012). We pre-dict that ATEG_03631 and 03632 may participate in the oxidation of 6-methyl; thus, related isoindolinone deriv-atives may be produced by this A. terreus PKS cluster (see Fig. 5c). Conclusions A. terreus is an important producer of many bioactive agents, and a large part of them are polyketides. In this review, we summarized seven reported polyketide biosynthesis pathways and predicted three possible gene clusters. Most A. terreus polyketide biosynthesis pathways are reported in last 5 years, suggesting that the research in this field is speeding up recent-ly. We believe that more polyketide pathways will be charac-terized in the near future. It is interesting that homologous clusters often can be found in other fungi, especially Aspergillus strains, and these clusters are important basis for us to make prediction. We think that this is an effective way to mine secondary metabolic gene clusters. Many of the aforementioned polyketides are anticancer metabolites, so the mass production of them is of great value. The knowledge of biosynthesis pathways is conducive to im-prove their production. For instance, native promoters can be replaced by controllable alcA promoter; moreover, heterolo-gous expression can be used; unicellular fungi S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris, and filamentous fungi A. nidulans and A. oryzae are all optional hosts. On the other hand, some genes such as transesterase gene lovD, transcription factor terR, and NRPS-like gene ATEG_03630 themselves are potential elements, which can be used in the production of other desired compounds.

        "Abstract The knowledge of biosynthesis gene clusters, pro-duction improving methods, and bioactivity mechanisms is very important for the development of filamentous fungi me-tabolites. Metabolic engineering and heterologous expression methods can be applied to improve desired metabolite produc-tion, when their biosynthesis pathways have been revealed. And, stable supplement is a necessary basis of bioactivity mechanism discovery and following clinical trial. Aspergillus terreus is an outstanding producer of many bioac-tive agents, and a large part of them are polyketides. In this review, we took polyketides from A. terreus as examples, focusing on 13 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes in A. terreus NIH 2624 genome. The biosynthesis pathways of nine PKS genes have been reported, and their downstream metabolites are lovastatin, terreic acid, terrein, geodin, terretonin, citreoviridin, and asperfuranone, respectively. Among them, lovastatin is a well-known hypolipidemic agent. Terreic acid, terrein, citreoviridin, and asperfuranone show good bioactivities, especially anticancer activities. On the oth-er hand, geodin and terretonin are mycotoxins. So, biosynthesis gene cluster information is important for the pro-duction or elimination of them. We also predicted three pos-sible gene clusters that contain four PKS genes by homolo-gous gene alignment with other Aspergillus strains. We think that this is an effective way to mine secondary metabolic gene clusters.",

        "Introduction",
        "Filamentous fungi are talented producers used for thousands of years, and they have attracted increasing attention over the past half century (Papagianni 2004). In East Asia, there are lots of traditional fermented food, for example, Aspergillus oryzae is used in rice wine production (Zhang et al. 2012), and Monascus is used in the production of fermented bean curd (Jiang et al. 2011). Purified fungal metabolites can be important medicines. Penicillin and cephalosporin (Abraham et al. 1953; Newton and Abraham 1955), two famous antibi-otics derived from filamentous fungi, have saved the lives of many infected people. Hypolipidemic agent lovastatin pro-duced by Aspergillus terreus (Askenazi et al. 2003) and im-munosuppressant cyclosporine A produced by Tolypocladium inflatum (Survase et al. 2011) are also typical pharmaceutical products from filamentous fungi. Nowadays, more and more novel natural products have been discovered from filamentous fungi. In the latest report, over 400 new compounds were derived from marine fungi in 2014 (Blunt et al. 2016). However, there is a long way between new compound and pharmaceutical agent. The compound must be stably supplied to meet the need of bioactivity assay and following clinical trial (Leal et al. 2014). And to produce a compound more",

        "effectively, we should better figure out its biosynthesis path-way. In a word, in the way from new compound to pharma-ceutical agent, much more need to be known besides its struc-ture. On the other hand, these information will also be helpful in the re-evaluation of known compounds.",
        "In this review, we take polyketides from A. terreus as ex-amples and summarize the information of their bioactivities, biosynthesis pathways, and production enhancement methods. This knowledge is helpful for the utilization of this filamentous fungus. As mentioned above, A. terreus has a famous polyketide product lovastatin; moreover, many bioac-tive polyketides have been isolated from A. terreus, such as terreic acid, terrein, geodin, terretonin, citreoviridin, asperfuranone, and so on. Additionally, the strain A. terreus NIH 2624 was sequenced by the Broad Institute as part of the Broad Fungal Genome Initiative in 2005, and the data are publicly available through the Broad Institute and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (Guo and Wang 2014). Completed genomic information assists re-searchers to find out the polyketide pathways in A. terreus. It was reported that there were 28 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, one hybrid PKS/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene, and two PKS-like genes in A. terreus NIH 2624 genome (Khaldi et al. 2010). Here, we will focus on 13 PKS genes, corresponding gene clusters, and their related secondary metabolites (see Table 1).",
        "Lovastatin",
        "Hypolipidemic agent lovastatin works as inhibitor of (3S)-hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR), that reduces HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is the key step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, statins were found to be anticancer agents (Chan et al. 2003). Malignant gliomas are highly dependent on the mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of lipid moieties critical to cell rep-lication; thus, it is uniquely vulnerable to the growth arrest by lovastatin (Prasanna et al. 1996). In a latest study, lovastatin also exerts anticancer effect on the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Yang et al. 2016). So, lova-statin may have other applications besides lowering cholesterol.",
        "The lovastatin (3) cluster has been well summarized. There are two highly reducing PKSs (HR-PKSs), LovB (lovastatin nonaketide synthase, ATEG_09961) and LovF (lovastatin diketide synthase, ATEG_09968), in its cluster (Hill 2006; Cox 2007; Campbell and Vederas 2010; Chiang et al. 2010a; Chooi and Tang 2012). As shown in Fig. 1a, dihydromonacolin L acid (1) is pro-duced by LovB and a trans-acting enoyl reductase (ER) LovC (ATEG_09963), then released by a thioesterase (TE) LovG (ATEG_09962) (Xu et al. 2013). Next, d ihydromonacol in L acid is oxidized by LovA (ATEG_09960) twice to form monacolin J acid (2). 2-Methylbutyrate moiety of lovastatin is synthesized by an-other HR-PKS LovF, and the covalent attachment of this moiety to 2 is catalyzed by a transesterase LovD (ATEG_09964) (Guo and Wang 2014). Nowadays, lova-statin is not the most frequently consumed statin; some semisynthetic statins like simvastatin are much more pop-ular. Since simvastatin differs from lovastatin in the side chain and LovD is responsible for the attachment of side chain to monacolin J acid, thus the efforts to engineer LovD were carried out (Jim\u00e9nez-Os\u00e9s et al. 2014). A mu-tant LovD containing 29 point mutations was generated by a directed evolution strategy; consequently, the protein efficiency in the synthesis of simvastatin was improved by about 1000-fold. Therefore, the knowledge of biosynthe-sis pathway is not only constructive for the production enhancement of its own product but also can facilitate connected semisynthetic drug production.",

But, its selective inhibition against the cata-lytic activity of Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (Btk) attracted more attention (Kawakami et al. 1999), so it could be a chemical probe to examine the function of Btk and a potential agent for rheumatoid arthritis, lymphoma, and other diseases (Pan 2008).",
        "About half a century ago, isotope labeling experiments showed that the biosynthesis of terreic acid (6) originated from 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA, 4) (Read and Vining 1968). And, 6-MSA synthase (6-MSAS) gene is one of the best characterized fungal PKS gene. This partly reduc-ing PKS (PR-PKS) was first reported in Penicillium patulum (Dimroth et al. 1970). In A. terreus NIH 2624, the homologous gene is atX (ATEG_06275) (Fujii et al. 1996). The heterologous expression of 6-MSA can be a judgment standard for the expression system of fungal polyketides. For instance, in the recombinant Pichia pastoris GS115-NpgA-ATX with Aspergillus nidulans and phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene npgA and atX, 2.2 g l-1 production of 6-MSA could be obtained, which suggested that P. pastoris was a potential host (Gao et al. 2013). In 2014, Boruta and Bizukojc (2014) speculated the terreic acid cluster by bioinformatic analysis, and it was finally experimentally characterized by Guo et al. (2014) by using a targeted gene deletion method in the same year. The cluster contains a total of eight genes: atA\u2013G and X (ATEG_06272\u201306278, 06280). As shown in Fig. 1b, AtA (ATEG_06272) is a hypothetical salicylate hydroxylase and catalyzes a decarboxylative hydroxyl-ation of 6-MSA. Sometimes, this catechol-type intermedi-ate will be oxidatively ring-opened and results in a shunt product (2Z,4E)-2-methyl-2,4-hexadienedioic acid. AtE (ATEG_06277) and AtG (ATEG_06280) are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, possibly catalyze further hydrox-ylation. And, the hydroxylation may trigger intramolecu-lar rearrangement like the condition in fungal tropolone biosynthesis (Davison et al. 2012). The function of AtD (ATEG_06276) is still unknown, but terreic acid cannot be biosynthesized without the presence of AtD, so maybe, it is involved in the epoxidation to gain terremutin (5). At last, GMC oxidoreductase AtC (ATEG_06274) catalyzes the oxidation of 5 to give the final product terreic acid (6). AtF (ATEG_06278) and AtB (ATEG_06273) are tran-scription factor and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, respectively.",

        "Terrein shows potential anticancer activities in a series of re-searches, inhibiting multidrug-resistant breast cancer (Liao et al. 2012), cervical carcinoma (Porameesanaporn et al. 2013), prostate cancer (Arakawa et al. 2008), ovarian cancer (Chen et al. 2014), and hepatoma (Zhang et al. 2015). And, it has several different mechanisms, including inhibiting angiogenin secretion, inducing apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest.",
        "Terrein (9) is a polyketide metabolite, which was con-firmed by isotope labeling study in 1960s (Birch et al. 1965), and its precursor 6-hydroxymellein (6-HM) had also been identified that way (Hill et al. 1981). On the other hand, the terrein cluster (ATEG_00135\u201300145) was serendipitously characterized in the effort to explore the biosynthesis pathway of conidial pigment in A. terreus recently (Zaehle et al. 2014). As shown in Fig. 2, the nonreducing PKS (NR-PKS) gene terA (ATEG_00145) has flexibility in controlling the length of the polyketide chain. Three different metabolites could be obtained in the heterologous expression of terA in Aspergillus niger (Zaehle et al. 2014); among them, 2,3-dehydro-6-HM (7) is a pentaketide like 6-HM (8). The formation of 8 needs another protein TerB (ATEG_00144), which is a multidomain protein with ketoreductase (KR) and dehydratase (DH) func-tions. When C-9 ketone is reduced by TerB, 8 can be easily derived by lactonization, while the cyclization in 7 is a bit different, which may need an intramolecular rearrangement that occurs in the biosynthesis of citrinin in Monascus (He and Cox 2016). The dehydration may also be catalyzed by TerB. TerC-F (ATEG_00140\u201300143) may be involved in the unusual contraction of the aryl ring, but the specific roles of these genes await further verification. We speculate that FAD-dependent monooxygenases TerC and TerD (ATEG_00142\u2013 143) catalyze hydroxylation and trigger oxidative dearomatization, similar to the key step of sorbicillinoid and tropolone biosynthesis (Davison et al. 2012; Fahad et al. 2014), also somewhat like the aforementioned condition in terreic acid biosynthesis. Hill et al. (1981) suggested that a ring contraction then happened, in contrast to the ring expan-sion in tropolone biosynthesis (Davison et al. 2012). Lastly, the extra carbon atoms may be removed by decarboxylation. TerG and TerJ (ATEG_00135, 00138) are MFS transporters, and the function of TerH\u2013I (ATEG_00136\u201300137) is not clear. Terrein production will decrease but not disappear in the ab-sence of them. Amusingly, we find a similar gene cluster (GAQ03937\u201303946) in the genome of Aspergillus lentulus strain IFM 54703, which also contains these unnecessary genes.",
        "Enough supply of glucose and citrate, which are favorable for polyketide biosynthesis, can improve terrein production (Yin et al. 2012, 2013). Furthermore, terrein is thought to play a role in fungus-plant interactions and ecological competition.",

        "The nitrogen response regulators AreA and AtfA and the iron response regulator HapX are upstream regulators of the terrein transcription factor TerR (ATEG_00139), which can regulate terrein biosynthesis (Gressler et al. 2015a). High production of terrein was achieved in two marine A. terreus strains, which were 7\u223c8 g l-1 in shake flask (Yin et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016) and 9 g l-1 in bioreactor (Xiao et al. 2013). Because of the high yield of terrein, the transcription factor TerR is also thought to be a new high-performance heterologous fungal expression system regulatory element (Gressler et al. 2015b).",
        "Geodin and emodin",
        "Geodin is a kind of mycotoxin (Br\u00e4se et al. 2009) that always simultaneously biosynthesized with lovastatin (Bizukojc and Ledakowicz 2007; Abd Rahim et al. 2015). Since they are both polyketides, modification of media does not have a good effect on removing geodin; the knowledge of their gene clus-ters can offer a better guidance.",
        "A. terreus produces series of yellow anthraquinone pig-ments, such as emodin and questin, but these yellow pigments disappeared when a NR-PKS gene was deleted (Couch and Gaucher 2004). In A. terreus NIH 2624, this PKS (ATEG_08451) was then named as atrochrysone carboxylic acid synthase (ACAS), and the polyketide product needs to be released with the aid of atrochrysone carboxyl ACP thioesterase (ACTE) encoded by ATEG_08450 (Awakawa et al. 2009). A small amount of emodin (11) could be obtained from in vitro reactions catalyzed by ACAS and ACTE, while the main product was atrochrysone (10), which was probably derived by spontaneous decarboxylation of the polyketide product. Much more emodin was gained from in vivo heter-ologous expression experiment in A. oryzae, which suggested that more genes should be involved in emodin biosynthesis.",
        "In fact, emodin is also an intermediate; many other metab-olites can be derived from this polyketide pathway, such as questin (12), sulochrin (13), geodin (15), and asterric acid (Couch and Gaucher 2004; Boruta and Bizukojc 2016). In 2013, Nielsen et al. (2013) transferred putative geodin gene cluster (ATEG_08449\u201308460) from A. terreus NIH 2624 to an expression platform in A. nidulans and gained geodin suc-cessfully. Proposed biosynthesis pathway for geodin is shown in Fig. 3a. Except ACAS (GedC) and ACTE (GedB), dihydrogeodin oxidase GedJ (ATEG_08458) that catalyzed the conversion of dihydrogeodin (14) to geodin (15) was pre-viously reported (Huang et al. 1995). The functions of the transcription factor GedR (ATEG_08453) responsible for the activation of geodin cluster and the halogenase GedL (ATEG_08460) that catalyzed the conversion of sulochrin (13) to dihydrogeodin (14) were verified by Nielsen\u2019s study. Meanwhile, similar gene clusters are also found in Aspergillus fumigatus (Afu4g14450\u201314580) and Aspergillus fischerianus (101790\u2013101920), without the presence of halogenase gene, which further substantiates the delineation of the geodin clus-ter (Nielsen et al. 2013). As a result, their putative product is trypacidin (Larsen et al. 2007), which differs from geodin only in the absence of chlorines and the presence of an additional methyl group. Furthermore, emodin is also a universal precur-sor of cladofulvin (Griffiths et al. 2016) andmonodictyphenone (Chiang et al. 2010b).",
        "Terretonin",
        "Mycotoxin terretonin is a kind of meroterpenoids that origi-nate from both polyketide and terpenoid pathways (McIntyre et al. 1989). The NR-PKS gene trt4 (ATEG_10080) is respon-sible for the biosynthesis of 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid (DMOA, 16). And, a farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is trans-ferred by a prenyltransferase Trt2 (ATEG_10078) to form farnesyl-DMOA (17) (Guo et al. 2012; Itoh et al. 2012). The whole gene cluster contains 10 genes (ATEG_10077\u201310086); the other genes catalyze following steps, e.g., methylation, epoxidation, and cyclization. The methylation of the carboxyl group catalyzed by Trt5 (ATEG_10081) is an essential step for cyclization (Matsuda et al. 2012). Then, epoxidation and cy-clization are catalyzed by epoxidase Trt8 (ATEG_10085) and terpene cyclase Trt1 (ATEG_10077), respectively. Next, short-chain dehydrogenase Trt9 (ATEG_10086) and FAD-dependent monooxygenase Trt3 (ATEG_10079) are involved to yield terrenoid (18). The last few steps of the terretonin pathway have been elucidated byMatsuda et al. (2015) recent-ly. They uncovered the unusual D-ring construction in terretonin biosynthesis by collaboration of a multifunctional cytochrome P450 Trt6 (ATEG_10083) and a unique isomer-ase Trt14 (ATEG_10082). Trt6 catalyzes three successive ox-idations to transform 18 into an unstable intermediate, which then undergoes the D-ring expansion and unusual rearrange-ment of the methoxy group catalyzed by Trt14 to afford the core skeleton of terretonin (19). Finally, the nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase Trt7 (ATEG_10084) accomplishes the last two oxidation steps to complete the biosynthesis (see Fig. 3b). Homologous genes can be also found in A. nidulans, but they locate in two different clusters and are responsible for the biosynthesis of austinol and dehydroaustinol (Lo et al. 2012).",
        "Citreoviridin",
        "Citreoviridin is an ATP synthase inhibitor that inhibits mito-chondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Suh and Wilcox 1988). It can uncompetitively inhibit ATP hydrolysis and ATP syn-thesis by binding to the\u03b2-subunit of F1-ATPase (Sayood et al. 1989). Ectopic ATP synthase is an accessible molecular target",

        "Citreoviridin (20) is a HR-PKS product confirmed by iso-tope labeling experiments in 1980s (Steyn et al. 1982), and its gene cluster is identified this year by resistance gene-driven genome mining (Lin et al. 2016). Lin et al. search for extra copies of the F1-ATPase\u03b2-subunit in the genome ofA. terreus NIH 2624 and find one gene (ATEG_09616) that is located next to a HR-PKS gene CtvA (ATEG_09617). Additionally, a methyltransferase CtvB (ATEG_09618), a hydrolase CtvD (ATEG_09619), and a flavin-dependent monooxygenase CtvC (ATEG_09620) are found in the locus. They are putative tailoring enzymes required for the synthesis of the tetrahydrofuran ring and methylated \u03b1-pyrone in citreoviridin (see Fig. 4a). Lin et al. heterologously expressed citreoviridin biosynthetic gene cluster in A. nidulans successfully. Similar cluster can be also found in Metarhizium anisopliae, which was known to produce analogous toxin aurovertin (Azumi et al. 2008).

As shown in Fig. 4b, the polyketide intermediate produced by HR-PKS gene AteafoG (ATEG_07659) may be transferred to NR-PKS AteafoE (ATEG_07661) with the aid of AteafoC (ATEG_07663) to give the complete polyketide (21). Two steps of hydroxylation are then catalyzed by AteafoD (ATEG_07662) and AteafoF (ATEG_07660), respectively. The hydroxylation of C-3 on the benzene ring results in intramolecular rearrangement, and a furan nucleus is formed by the latter step. Last, the authors inferred that there existed an endogenous reductase in A. nidulans to catalyze the final conversion to asperfuranone (22).",
        "Three predicted PKS clusters",
        "The gene clusters of another four PKS genes (ATEG_03432, 03446, 03629, 08662) are still not clear, but there are some hints, so we try to give the prediction of their gene clusters in this review. ATEG_03432 and ATEG_08662 are both NR-PKS-R genes like ateafoE (ATEG_07661). NR-PKS-R genes are always involved in the biosynthesis of azaphilones, such as citrinin (He and Cox 2016). So, the products of the clusters of ATEG_03432 and ATEG_08662 are probable to be azaphilones. The heterologous expression of NR-PKS gene ATEG_03629 in A. nidulans results in the production of 5-methyl orsellinic acid (5-MOA, 25) (Chiang et al. 2013), sim-ilar to the product of trt4 (ATEG_10080). Moreover, the use of methyl orsellinic acid as a starting material is widely ob-served in other fungal pathways, such as tropolones (Davison et al. 2012) and xenovulene (Bailey et al. 2007).",
        "There is a fatty acid synthetase (FAS) gene pair (ATEG_08867 and 08868) that occurs near the NR-PKS-R gene ATEG_08662. Just l ike the condit ion of asperfuranone cluster, a highly homologous gene cluster can be found in A. nidulans (AN3379\u20133386) (see Table 2). Ahuja et al. (2012) activated the A. nidulans clus-ter by exchanging the promoters of PKS and FAS genes with controllable alcA promoter and isolated a major prod-uct, 2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl-6-(2-oxoundecyl) benzalde-hyde (23) along with other corresponding products from the mycelium (see Fig. 5a). In particular, a decanoyl starter unit is firstly synthesized by the FAS and then loaded onto PKS. We speculate that similar products can be derived from A. terreus cluster. On the other hand, heterologous expression of these three PKS and FAS genes in A. nidulans resulted in no product (Chiang et al. 2013). Therefore, loading of the starter unit may need other genes in the predicted cluster. And, the monooxygenase",

        "Boruta and Bizukojc (2014) speculated that ATEG_03432 was responsible for the biosynthesis of citrinin in A. terreus. But, the heterologous expression of ATEG_03432 in A. nidulans did not result in the precursor of citrinin but the precursor of Monascus azaphilone pigment (24) (Chiang et al. 2013). Although they have similar structure and biosynthesis pathways, they are different in the length of polyketide chain and the number of methyl groups. Instead of the FAS gene pair that occurred in the Monascus azaphilone pigment biosynthesis cluster (Balakrishnan et al. 2013; Balakrishnan et al. 2014), there is a HR-PKS gene ATEG_03446 near to ATEG_03432.

NR-PKS azaA shows 50 % identity with ATEG_03432 and has the same product of ATEG_03432. HR-PKS azaB shows 33 % identity with ATEG_03446. Moreover, homologs of azaC, G\u2013J, L, and R also can be found between ATEG_03432 and ATEG_03446 (see Table 3 and Fig. 5b). Among them, N-terminus of ATEG_03443 shows 38 % identity with azaJ, and its C-terminus shows 55 % identity with azaH, so there may be two genes in ATEG_03443, and we differentiate them as ATEG_03443-1 and ATEG_03443-2. AzaH was proved to be occupied in the pyran-ring formation of azanigerones (Zabala et al. 2012); thus, ATEG_03443-2 may have the same important function, somewhat like the function of AteafoD (ATEG_07662). ATEG_03445 is a Zn2Cys6 regulator lo-cated next to HR-PKS ATEG_03446 and shows 40 % identity with azaR, the activator of azanigerone cluster; hence, it is suggested to be the transcriptional factor of the cluster. Consequently, we conjecture that there is a gene cluster between ATEG_03432 and ATEG_03446, and its product may be an analog of azanigerone.",
        "Heterologous expression of ATEG_03629 and the next NRPS-like gene ATEG_03630 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that ATEG_03630 could reduce 5-MOA to 2,4-dihydroxy 5,6-dimethyl benzaldehyde (26) (Wang et al. 2014). The function of the NRPS-like gene is to some extent similar to the R domain in the afore-mentioned NR-PKS-R genes. Interestingly, engineering of the adenylation domain of this NRPS-like protein can achieve a potential biocatalyst for aldehyde genera-tion (Wang and Zhao 2014). Homologous genes of ATEG_03629 and 03630 can be found in A. nidulans, which are AN6448 and AN6444, respectively. Similar gene pairs also exist in the genome of Stachybotrys (Li et al. 2016). Furthermore, cytochrome P450 ATEG_03631 shows 49 % identity with AN6449, and short-chain dehydrogenase ATEG_03632 shows 54 % identity with AN6450 (see Table 4).

When 6-methyl is oxidized to aldehyde, the isoindolinone core in cichorine can be formed spontaneously in the pres-ence of ammonium ions (Yuuichi et al. 2012). We pre-dict that ATEG_03631 and 03632 may participate in the oxidation of 6-methyl; thus, related isoindolinone deriv-atives may be produced by this A. terreus PKS cluster (see Fig. 5c).",
        "Conclusions",
        "A. terreus is an important producer of many bioactive agents, and a large part of them are polyketides. In this review, we summarized seven reported polyketide biosynthesis pathways and predicted three possible gene clusters. Most A. terreus polyketide biosynthesis pathways are reported in last 5 years, suggesting that the research in this field is speeding up recent-ly. We believe that more polyketide pathways will be charac-terized in the near future. It is interesting that homologous clusters often can be found in other fungi, especially Aspergillus strains, and these clusters are important basis for us to make prediction. We think that this is an effective way to mine secondary metabolic gene clusters.",
        "Many of the aforementioned polyketides are anticancer metabolites, so the mass production of them is of great value. The knowledge of biosynthesis pathways is conducive to im-prove their production. For instance, native promoters can be replaced by controllable alcA promoter; moreover, heterolo-gous expression can be used; unicellular fungi S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris, and filamentous fungi A. nidulans and A. oryzae are all optional hosts. On the other hand, some genes such as transesterase gene lovD, transcription factor terR, and NRPS-like gene ATEG_03630 themselves are potential elements, which can be used in the production of other desired compounds.",
