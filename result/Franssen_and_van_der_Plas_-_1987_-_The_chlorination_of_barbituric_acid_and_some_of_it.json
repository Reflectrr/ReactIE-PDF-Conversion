INTRODUCTION Chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago (EC 1.11.1.10, chloride: hydro-gen-peroxide oxidoreductase) is a widely studied enzyme capable of halogenating a variety of organic compounds by means of hydrogen peroxide and chloride, bromide, or iodide ions. Examples are P-dicarbonyl species such as monochloro-dimedon (1,2), alkenes (3-5), cyclopropanes (6) and the heterocycles thiazole (7), antipyrine (8), and NADH (9). The reaction mechanism of the enzyme is still a matter of controversy. There is some evidence that a complex is formed involving an oxidized form of the en-zyme, a halide ion, and the organic substrate (10, II). Other results imply that the halogenation is performed by an enzyme-made hypohalous acid (12, 13). A third mechanism was published recently involving hypohalous acid or elemental halo-gens and radical intermediates (14). Due to our continuing interest into the chemistry of heterocycles and the use of (immobilized) enzymes in organic syntheses (25) we investigated the potential application of chloroperoxidase (CPO) in heterocyclic chemistry. In this paper, we wish to present the results on the CPO-mediated halogenation of barbituric acid and some of its derivatives. Moreover, we want to report on our studies concerning the kinetics of these halogenation reactions and on their implications I To whom correspondence may be addressed. 59 0045-2068/87 $3.00 Copyright 0 1987 by Academic Press, Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General. Chloroperoxidase (crude type) from Caldariomyces fumago was ob-tained from Sigma Chemical Company or was a gift from E. de Boer and Dr. R. Wever from the Laboratory of Biochemistry, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The specific activity of the enzyme was 400-600 pmol monochloro-dimedone * mg protein-\u2019 * min-i, depending on the batch used. Protein concentra-tions were determined by the Lowry method (17) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Monochlorodimedone (MCD) was also purchased from Sigma. 1,3-Dimethylbarbituric acid was obtained from Fluka and the other substituted barbi-turic acids were synthesized from the corresponding malonic ester and urea deriv-atives according to the procedure of Dickey and Gray (18). Xhlorobarbituric acid and 5,$dichlorobarbituric acid were obtained by means of Bock\u2019s method (29). Sodium hypochlorite solution was purchased from Janssen Chimica and was assayed by injecting an appropriate amount in 0.1 mM MCD, pH 2.7. The differ-ence in AzT8 is proportional to the hypochlorite concentration, using As = 12200 M-1 . cm-\u2018. All chemicals were of the highest commercial grade. UV spectra and kinetic measurements were performed on an Aminco-Chance DW-2 split-beam spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were recorded on an AEI MS 902 instrument or a VG Micromass 7070 F apparatus (direct probe mode). Circular dichroism spectra were run on a Jobin-Yvon Auto-Dichrograph Mark V. HPLC analysis was carried out on a Varian 5000 instrument (see below for experimental details). HPLC measurements. The reaction of CPO with barbituric acid and its deriva-tives could be monitored by HPLC using reversed-phase, ion-pair chromatog-raphy. The stationary phase was a Spherisorb-S 10 ODS column. The mobile phase was a mixture of 20% methanol and 80% water containing 10 mM potassium phosphate and 5 mM nonyltrimethylammonium bromide, pH 7.3 (28% methanol for le). The eluent flow was 1 .O ml/min. An aliquot of the enzymatic reaction was taken and directly injected into the chromatograph. The barbituric acids were detected by means of their UV absorption at 265 nm (245 nm for lc). Kinetic measurements. Specific activities of the enzyme were determined under the standard assay conditions (2): 100 mM HjPOd/KOH, pH 2.7,20 mM KCl, 0.24 mM H202, 0.1 mM MCD, 25\u00b0C. To 2.5 ml of this solution was added loo-150 ng CPO and the absorption at 278 nm was followed, using de = 12,200 M-\u2019 . cm-\u2018. These conditions were also applied in all other kinetic measurements and in the experiments where there was no need for isolation of the product; for the com-pounds la-c 0.48 IllM Hz02 was used. All determinations were carried out in triplicate. The following molar absorption coefficients (AE, M-I * cm-\u2018) were used at pH CHLORINATION OF BARBITURIC ACID 61 0 R3 H 0 \u201d 1 2 3 0 R,.

UV absorption spectra as recorded during the reaction of barbituric acid (la) with chloroper-oxidase. The quartz cuvette was filled with 2.5 ml of a solution containing 0.1 mM la, 0.48 mM H202, 20 mM KCl, and 0.1 M H,PO,/KOH, pH 2.7. To this 114 ng of CPO was added, and UV spectra were recorded with appropriate time intervals. 1, t = 0 min (pure la); 2, t = 0.5 min; 3, t = 2.0 min; 4, t = 5.0 min; 5, t = 8.0 min (reaction is complete). The pH of the solution was maintained at 2.7 by adding dilute HCI when needed. After 15 min incubation the reaction mixture was either lyophilized and extracted with distilled methanol or analyzed by HPLC (see above). RESULTS Reaction of CPO with Barbituric Acid and Its Derivatives When barbituric acid (la) is incubated with CPO under standard conditions, a rapid change in the UV spectrum is visible (see Fig. 1). During the first 2 min of the reaction the original absorption peak of la at 258 nm shifts to a higher wave-length (268 nm) with a concomitant increase of the absorption intensity. After this period the peak at 268 nm slowly disappears, indicating the consecutive formation of a second product (peak at 210 nm, not shown in the figure). The same observa-tion is made when monitoring the reaction by reversed-phase, ion-pair HPLC (see Fig. 2). At t = 0 min, only a peak of la appears (tr = 4.3 min).

Ten microliters of the enzymatic reaction medium was injected directly into the chromatograph (see Materials and Methods).

After 8 min reaction time no further changes in the chromatogram are observed, and only a large peak of the second product and a small one of the primary compound are visible.2 The UV spectra and the retention times of the products coincide perfectly with authentic Schlorobarbituric acid (24 and 5,Sdichlorobarbituric acid (3a), indicat-ing that la undergoes chlorination at C-5. That these compounds are indeed formed is confirmed by the mass spectra of 2a and 3a, isolated from the enzyme-mediated chlorination of la, which were fully identical to those obtained from Z It should be noted that the described chromatographic system separates various barbituric acid derivatives excellently, whereas other stationary phases (silica, silica modified with propionitril or octadecyl groups, or ion-exchange columns) either give no separation or unacceptably long retention times.

The reaction sequence is depicted in Scheme 1. Additional evidence for the suggested reaction path is given by the fact that authentic 2a is converted by the enzyme into 3a at a high rate, showing that the first chlorination takes place at C-5 and a subsequent chlorination at the same position. The yield of 3a is 99%, based on the HPLC measurements. No N-halogenated product is detectable; this is supported by our observation that cyanuric acid (4) shows no reactivity toward the enzyme. Comparison of the enzyme-mediated chlorination with the standard chemical procedures for chlorination of la (29-21) show that the yield is higher in the enzymatic reaction.3 However, pure 5monochlorobarbituric acids like 2a-c can-not be prepared, directly by the enzymatic procedure: if the reaction is stopped halfway or if only one equivalent of Hz02 is used a mixture of starting material and monochloro and dichloro product is obtained. It has been reported that by com-bining the enzymatic conversion with an electrochemical reduction, the initially produced 3a can be reduced quantitatively into 2a in one step, allowing the isola-tion of pure 2a (22, 23). The enzymatic chlorination reaction was also investigated with substituted bar-bituric acids as substrates. l-Methylbarbituric acid (lb) and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid (lc) are converted via their 5-chloro derivatives 2b and 2c into the 5,5-dichloro compounds 3b and 3c (see Scheme 1) in yields comparable to those obtained with la (see Table 1). The 5-phenylbarbituric acids Id and le are also found to be very good substrates for the enzyme, giving the corresponding 5-chloro derivatives 2d and 2e, respectively, in very good yields. Remarkably, 5-hydroxybarbituric acid (5) seems to resist the enzymatic chlorination reaction since the UV spectrum of 5 did not show any change. 3 For example, 3n was synthesized by treating la with chlorine in water (19,20). No yield was given, but in our hands it was 56%.

Kinetics of the CPO-Mediated Chlorination of Barbituric Acids To gain further insight into the mechanism of the enzyme-mediated reaction, we studied the kinetics of the chlorination of barbituric acid (la) and some of its derivatives (lb-e). Comparison of the enzymatic chlorination rate of MCD with those determined with Id and 2a shows that the velocities of the three reactions differ only to a very small extent (see Table 2). The presence of methyl groups on the barbituric acid nitrogen atoms also has no effect on the rate of chlorination (Table 3). Since we deal with two competing reactions (1 --, 2 and 2 + 3) we determined the total time TABLE 3 TIME NEEDED FOR COMPLETE CONVERSION (l--j 3) OF SOME BARBITURIC ACIDS\u201d Compound Conversion time b la 100 2 3\u2019 lb 101 ? 4 lc 111 lr4 a Determined under standard assay conditions by monitoring the UV ab-sorption at 268 nm, except that [H202] = 0.48 mM. b Arbitrary units; the value for la was set at 100; n = 2; each value is the mean of three determinations. c Corresponds to 150 s. 66 FRANSSEN AND VAN DER PLAS in which the reaction 14 3 is completed. The results thus obtained indicate that the barbituric acids show considerable flexibility in their structure regarding their reactivity toward CPO. It appears that they do not influence the reaction rate, suggesting that the active site of the enzyme can accommodate compounds with rather different electronic and steric influences. This result is further supported by the fact that the concentration of neither MCD, nor of Id and 2a in the range of 2 to 100 ,UM, has any effect on the enzymatic reaction rate, so no K,,, value could be obtained for these substrates. Additional information is obtained from inhibition experiments. As mentioned previously, cyanuric acid (4) and 5hydroxybarbituric acid (5) are not reactive toward the enzyme. Since both compounds contain the P-dicarbonyl function common to all good substrates for CPO, there is the possibility of a nonproductive binding. However, we find that 4 and 5 in concentrations up to 200 PM are not able to inhibit the enzymatic chlorination of MCD. Stereochemistry of the Chlorination Reaction To determine whether the enzyme-mediated halogenation shows some ste-reoselectivity, we investigated the halogenation of 1-methyl-5phenylbarbituric acid (le). Compound le has a chiral C-5 atom. Resolution of the two enantiomers in le is not possible, however, because of the rapid enolization at C-5 in protic solvents. When the hydrogen at C-5 in le is replaced by a halogen atom, the configuration is fixed and possibly one isomer is formed preferentially in a ste-reoselective reaction. To examine whether CPO is capable of stereoselective halogenation, the enzymatic chlorination of le is monitored by means of circular dichroism. However, the CD spectrum shows no absorption, clearly indicating that a racemic mixture is obtained and thus no stereoselective reaction has oc-curred. This result is in agreement with investigations performed by other authors (3, 4, 24). Reactions with HOC1 When the barbituric acids are incubated with HOCl, we find that the products are the same as in the enzymatical reactions, but yield and purity are generally much lower: la-c give mixtures of 2a-c and 3a-c. The results are summarized in Table 1. The yields of the 5,5-dichlorobarbituric acids are not improved by adding CHLORINATION OF BARBITURIC ACID 67 not IW enzyme + HOC1 native enzyme A-H Hz0 A-CI SCHEME 2. The reaction mechanism of Caldariomyces f&ago chloroperoxidase. The protein part 68 FRANSSEN AND VAN DER PLAS Support for route II comes from the fact that the products obtained from both enzymatic and HOC1 reactions (2, 5, 6) as well as their ratios in case of mixture (13), are identical. No stereoselectivity was found with the enzymatic reactions (3, 4, 24). Without addition of an organic substrate, the enzyme produces HOC1 (II), and studies on the catalase reaction of the enzyme also pointed to HOC1 involvement (12). Recently, a combination of free radicals and molecular halogens was suggested to play a role in the halogenation reaction (14). The results presented in this publication show that CPO is an enzyme with a broad substrate specifity. Barbituric acid (la) and a number of its derivatives are chlorinated by the enzyme in very good yields. HOC1 has the same regioselectiv-ity as CPO, since with HOC1 the same chloro compounds are obtained, although both yield and purity of the products are usually far lower than in the enzymatic reaction. In contrast to what is reported in the literature (4), the concentration of MCD (or any barbituric acid derivative, not shown) has no influence on the enzymatic reaction rate in the range 2-100 ,!LM. Moreover, even the nature of the organic substrate is not important to the enzyme, as can be concluded from the results mentioned in Tables 2 and 3.5 Potential inhibitors such as 4 and 5 have no effect, and the enzyme-mediated chlorination of le is not stereoselective. Although it is tempting to conclude from our work that CPO from C. fumago reacts via route II, generating free HOC& caution should be exercised. The fact that both CPO and HOC1 show the same regioselectivity, and complete lack of stereoselectivity, cannot be considered as a definite proof for enzymatically gen-erated free HOC1 since it remains possible that the enzyme has a HOCl-like reactivity, for instance via heme-bound hypochlorite. In addition, most studies mentioned in the literature deal with substrates which are far less reactive than MCD and which use much more enzyme and longer reaction times than is neces-sary for standard assay conditions. It is possible that under reaction conditions in which the enzyme cannot find a suitable substrate HOC1 is produced as if there were no substrate at all. The fact that le is not chlorinated stereoselectively cannot be considered as evidence for route I because the difference between the enantiotopic faces of the substrate is possibly too small to exert influence. Moreover, it is questionable whether stereoselectivity is an intrinsic property of the enzyme, as shown in the conversion of cyclopentanedione (its natural substrate, 27) to caldariomycin, in which there is no need for stereoselective control. The kinetic measurements presented in this study do not allow a decision whether route I or II is most favored either. The fact that the concentration of the organic substrate has no influence on the rate-determining step does not exclude route II. The reaction between MCD or barbiturates and HOC1 is possibly so fast that the first two steps in the enzymatic reaction sequence, which are independent of the organic substrate concentration, determine the overall reaction velocity. The same reasoning is valid-for route I: if step 1 or 2 is much slower than the J The fact that 4 and 5 are not converted by the enzyme seems contradictory to this conclusion; however, neither of these compounds are halogenated by HOCI, so these results do not support any mechanism. CHLORINATION OF BARBITURIC ACID 69 subsequent steps, the concentration of the organic substrate will not affect the overall reaction velocity. The fact that the rate constant for the enzymatic chlori-nation step could only be determined under nonstandard assay conditions with stopped-flow techniques is evidence for this view (10). A K, value for MCD is reported (4), but our results indicate that it cannot have been determined at pH 2.7 using 20 mM KC1 and 0.24 mM Hz02. We conclude that most of the literature data concerning the reaction mechanism of CPO, including our own, do not permit a choice between route I or II. How-ever, even if route II is proven to be correct, the steady-state concentration of HOC1 in the reaction medium is so low that CPO is still a smooth halogenating agent allowing the synthesis of various chlorinated barbituric acids in very high yields. Therefore the use of chloroperoxidase as a synthetic tool in organic chem-istry will remain a subject of current investigation. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are much indebted to Mr. W. Ch. Melger and Mr. G. P.

During the first 2 min of the reaction the original absorption peak of la at 258 nm shifts to a higher wave-length (268 nm) with a concomitant increase of the absorption intensity. After this period the peak at 268 nm slowly disappears, indicating the consecutive formation of a second product (peak at 210 nm, not shown in the figure). The same observa-tion is made when monitoring the reaction by reversed-phase, ion-pair HPLC (see Fig. 2).",

The results thus obtained indicate that the barbituric acids show considerable flexibility in their structure regarding their reactivity toward CPO. It appears that they do not influence the reaction rate, suggesting that the active site of the enzyme can accommodate compounds with rather different electronic and steric influences. This result is further supported by the fact that the concentration of neither MCD, nor of Id and 2a in the range of 2 to 100 ,UM, has any effect on the enzymatic reaction rate, so no K,,, value could be obtained for these substrates.",
        "Additional information is obtained from inhibition experiments. As mentioned previously, cyanuric acid (4) and 5hydroxybarbituric acid (5) are not reactive toward the enzyme. Since both compounds contain the P-dicarbonyl function common to all good substrates for CPO, there is the possibility of a nonproductive binding. However, we find that 4 and 5 in concentrations up to 200 PM are not able to inhibit the enzymatic chlorination of MCD. Stereochemistry of the Chlorination Reaction",
        "To determine whether the enzyme-mediated halogenation shows some ste-reoselectivity, we investigated the halogenation of 1-methyl-5phenylbarbituric acid (le). Compound le has a chiral C-5 atom. Resolution of the two enantiomers in le is not possible, however, because of the rapid enolization at C-5 in protic solvents. When the hydrogen at C-5 in le is replaced by a halogen atom, the configuration is fixed and possibly one isomer is formed preferentially in a ste-reoselective reaction. To examine whether CPO is capable of stereoselective halogenation, the enzymatic chlorination of le is monitored by means of circular dichroism. However, the CD spectrum shows no absorption, clearly indicating that a racemic mixture is obtained and thus no stereoselective reaction has oc-curred. This result is in agreement with investigations performed by other authors (3, 4, 24). Reactions with HOC1",
        "When the barbituric acids are incubated with HOCl, we find that the products are the same as in the enzymatical reactions, but yield and purity are generally much lower: la-c give mixtures of 2a-c and 3a-c.

        "Support for route II comes from the fact that the products obtained from both enzymatic and HOC1 reactions (2, 5, 6) as well as their ratios in case of mixture (13), are identical. No stereoselectivity was found with the enzymatic reactions (3, 4, 24). Without addition of an organic substrate, the enzyme produces HOC1 (II), and studies on the catalase reaction of the enzyme also pointed to HOC1 involvement (12). Recently, a combination of free radicals and molecular halogens was suggested to play a role in the halogenation reaction (14).",
        "The results presented in this publication show that CPO is an enzyme with a broad substrate specifity. Barbituric acid (la) and a number of its derivatives are chlorinated by the enzyme in very good yields. HOC1 has the same regioselectiv-ity as CPO, since with HOC1 the same chloro compounds are obtained, although both yield and purity of the products are usually far lower than in the enzymatic reaction. In contrast to what is reported in the literature (4), the concentration of MCD (or any barbituric acid derivative, not shown) has no influence on the enzymatic reaction rate in the range 2-100 ,!LM. Moreover, even the nature of the organic substrate is not important to the enzyme, as can be concluded from the results mentioned in Tables 2 and 3.5 Potential inhibitors such as 4 and 5 have no effect, and the enzyme-mediated chlorination of le is not stereoselective.",
        "Although it is tempting to conclude from our work that CPO from C. fumago reacts via route II, generating free HOC& caution should be exercised. The fact that both CPO and HOC1 show the same regioselectivity, and complete lack of stereoselectivity, cannot be considered as a definite proof for enzymatically gen-erated free HOC1 since it remains possible that the enzyme has a HOCl-like reactivity, for instance via heme-bound hypochlorite. In addition, most studies mentioned in the literature deal with substrates which are far less reactive than MCD and which use much more enzyme and longer reaction times than is neces-sary for standard assay conditions. It is possible that under reaction conditions in which the enzyme cannot find a suitable substrate HOC1 is produced as if there were no substrate at all.",
        "The fact that le is not chlorinated stereoselectively cannot be considered as evidence for route I because the difference between the enantiotopic faces of the substrate is possibly too small to exert influence. Moreover, it is questionable whether stereoselectivity is an intrinsic property of the enzyme, as shown in the conversion of cyclopentanedione (its natural substrate, 27) to caldariomycin, in which there is no need for stereoselective control.",
        "The kinetic measurements presented in this study do not allow a decision whether route I or II is most favored either. The fact that the concentration of the organic substrate has no influence on the rate-determining step does not exclude route II. The reaction between MCD or barbiturates and HOC1 is possibly so fast that the first two steps in the enzymatic reaction sequence, which are independent of the organic substrate concentration, determine the overall reaction velocity. The same reasoning is valid-for route I: if step 1 or 2 is much slower than the",
        "J The fact that 4 and 5 are not converted by the enzyme seems contradictory to this conclusion; however, neither of these compounds are halogenated by HOCI, so these results do not support any mechanism.",
        "CHLORINATION OF BARBITURIC ACID 69",
        "subsequent steps, the concentration of the organic substrate will not affect the overall reaction velocity. The fact that the rate constant for the enzymatic chlori-nation step could only be determined under nonstandard assay conditions with stopped-flow techniques is evidence for this view (10). A K, value for MCD is reported (4), but our results indicate that it cannot have been determined at pH 2.7 using 20 mM KC1 and 0.24 mM Hz02.",
        "We conclude that most of the literature data concerning the reaction mechanism of CPO, including our own, do not permit a choice between route I or II. How-ever, even if route II is proven to be correct, the steady-state concentration of HOC1 in the reaction medium is so low that CPO is still a smooth halogenating agent allowing the synthesis of various chlorinated barbituric acids in very high yields. Therefore the use of chloroperoxidase as a synthetic tool in organic chem-istry will remain a subject of current investigation.",
