M. Murray, Shaun M. K. McKinnie, Henry P. Pepper, Reto Erni, Zachary D. Miles, Michelle C. Cruickshank, Borja Llpez-P8rez, Bradley S. Moore,* and Jonathan H. George* Abstract: The naphterpins and marinones are naphthoqui-none meroterpenoids with an unusual aromatic oxidation pattern that is biosynthesized from 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaph-thalene (THN). We propose that cryptic halogenation of THN derivatives by vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase (VCPO) enzymes is key to this biosynthetic pathway, despite the absence of chlorine in these natural products. This speculation inspired a total synthesis to mimic the naphterpin/marinone biosynthet-ic pathway. In validation of this biogenetic hypothesis, two VCPOs were discovered that interconvert several of the proposed biosynthetic intermediates. The chemical reactions in a cell obey the same logic of organic chemistry as those that occur in a round-bottomed flask. As such, we can often use our knowledge of organic reactivity to predict a probable biosynthetic pathway to a natural product from its relatively limited pool of biochem-ical reagents. The total synthesis of a whole biosynthetic pathway offers an opportunity to interrogate a biogenetic hypothesis by providing both the substrates and the expected products for experiments with enzymes that are discovered through a genome mining approach. This collaborative approach gives insight into the chemistry of life, while also adding biosynthetic enzymes to the toolkit of synthetic chemists in the quest for the fastest and most efficient ways to construct complex organic molecules. In the past 30 years, many naphthoquinone meroterpe-noid antibiotics biosynthetically derived from 1,3,6,8-tetrahy-droxynaphthalene (THN) have been isolated from marine and soil strains of Streptomyces bacteria, including the naphterpins,[1] marinones,[2] napyradiomycins,[3] and mero-chlorins.[4] 7-Demethylnaphterpin (1, also known as naphth-geranine A)[1b,c] is the simplest member of the naphterpin/ marinone family (Figure 1). It possesses a naphthoquinone ring system oxygenated at C-2, C-6, and C-8 and is cis-fused to a geranyl side chain (attached by a C@C bond at C-3). Naphterpin[1a] (2) has an additional C-7 methyl substituent, and it is co-isolated with its oxidized analogues naphterpins B (3) and C (not shown).[1e] Marinones (4\u20136), isolated from Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509,[2] have an extra prenyl group compared to 1 that is derived from cyclization of a farnesyl side chain. Marinone (5) and isomarinone (6) have a bromine substituent at C-5 and C-7, respectively. Several structurally similar naphthoquinone meroterpenoids have been isolated from trees of the Bigno-niaceae family, such as pyranokunthone A, which was syn-thesized by Trauner using an intramolecular hetero-Diels\u2013 Alder reaction.[5] Presumably, a similar hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction is involved at a late stage of the biosynthesis of the naphterpins and marinones. However, in the case of these Streptomyces meroterpenoids, the mechanism of the biosyn-thesis of the highly oxidized naphthoquinone ring system is currently unknown. Although naphterpins and marinones have been shown to be biosynthesized from THN through 13C labeling studies,[6] the oxidation pattern of THN does not obviously correlate with the oxidation pattern of these natural Figure 1. a) The mechanism of the biosynthesis of many naphthoqui-products. Furthermore, THN is nucleophilic at C-2 and C-4, but the naphterpins and marinones possess an isoprene substituent at the non-nucleophilic C-3 position. We recently reported two vanadium-dependent chloro-peroxidase (VCPO)[7] enzymes, Mcl24 and NapH3,[8] that catalyze a-hydroxyketone rearrangements to shift terpene side chains[9] from C-4 to C-3 in merochlorin and napyradio-mycin biosynthesis, respectively (Scheme 1). Mcl24 catalyzes oxidative dearomatization and dichlorination of the THN ring system of 7 followed by a 1,2-shift to give 8, whereas NapH3 just catalyzes the 1,2-shift of 9 to give naphthomevalin (10), the simplest member of the napyradiomycin family. The discovery of these enzymes, combined with associated bio-mimetic synthetic work, led us to propose a biosynthesis of the napyradiomycins.[8] Herein, we extend this biosynthetic logic to include the naphterpins and marinones. Our proposed biosynthesis of 7-demethylnaphterpin (1) and debromomarinone (4) from THN is outlined in Scheme 2. Firstly, THN is known to be biosynthesized by the condensa-tion of five malonyl-coenzyme A units followed by aromati-zation of the resultant pentaketide under the control of a single type III polyketide synthase.[10] Next, we propose that THN undergoes geranylation or farnesylation at C-4 to give 11a and 11b. This reaction is putatively catalyzed in vivo by the NphB aromatic prenyltransferase in naphterpin biosyn-thesis[11] or by CnqP3 or CnqP4 in marinone biosynthesis.[12] We then propose that 11 a/11 b are subjected to VCPO-catalyzed oxidative dearomatization to initially give 12a/12 b, followed by VCPO-catalyzed chlorination at C-2 to give monochlorides 13 a/13b and dichlorides 14 a/14b. A VCPO-catalyzed a-hydroxyketone rearrangement (which shifts the geranyl substituent from C-4 to C-3) would then give 15a/15 b. Computational studies have shown that this rearrangement is thermodynamically favorable, and the proposed multi-tasking VCPO chemistry is analogous to the known reactivity of the VCPO Mcl24 in merochlorin biosynthesis (Scheme 1a).[8] Exposure of 15a/15 b to mildly basic conditions should induce cyclization to give a-chloroepoxides 16 a/16b. A similar cyclization has been proposed to occur in the biosynthesis of A80 915G from naphthomevalin.[13] A handful of marine a-chloroepoxide natural products have been previously reported,[14] but none have yet been proposed as intermediates in biosynthetic pathways. Next, we propose Scheme 1. VCPO enzymes known to catalyze a-hydroxyketone rear-reductive dehalogenation of a-chloroepoxides 16a/16b to give hydroxynaphthoquinones 17 a/17b. Related reductions of naphthoquinone epoxides to give naphthoquinones have been proposed in the biosynthesis and used in the biomimetic synthesis of zeylanone[15] and the juglocombins.[16] Impor-tantly, the C-7 methylated analogue of 17a, which we suggest is the direct biosynthetic precursor of naphterpin (2), has been isolated as a Streptomyces metabolite.[17] Next, oxidation and facile E-to-Z double-bond isomer-ization of 17a/17 b would give the reactive enones 18a/18 b, which could be converted to 7-demethylnaphterpin (1) and debromomarinone (4) through intramolecular hetero-Diels\u2013 Alder reactions. This oxidative cyclization is similar to the biosynthesis of D1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid from canna-bigerolic acid catalyzed by THCA synthase.[18] The proposed oxidation of 17 a/17 b also has precedent in the biosynthesis of chlorizidine A in a marine strain of Streptomyces.[19] The naphterpins and marinones are isolated as enantiopure compounds, so the oxidative cyclization of achiral 17a/17b must be under enzymatic stereocontrol. Finally, late-stage, vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase-catalyzed bromina-tion of 4 at C-5 or C-7 would give marinone (5) or isomarinone (6), respectively. Despite the absence of chlorine in the naphterpin and marinone natural products, we propose that this rather elaborate biosynthetic pathway involves cryptic chlorination[20] to selectively oxidize the THN ring and promote the a-hydroxyketone rearrangement. Genomic analyses of marinone-producing Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509 supports this biosynthetic hypothesis through the clustering of VCPO and aromatic prenyltransferase homologues with a THN synthase.[12] In the case of naphterpin biosynthesis, only three genes have yet been reported, none of which are VCPOs.[11a] We completed a total synthesis of the whole biosynthetic pathway leading to 7-demethylnaphterpin (1) and debromo-marinone (4) from a protected THN derivative using a sequence of key reactions that occur in the same order as the proposed biosynthesis. The synthesis was therefore designed to give access to as many proposed biosynthetic intermediates as possible, for use in later biosynthetic studies. Firstly, di-MOM-protected THN derivative 19 was gerany-lated[8] at C-4 with 20a or farnesylated with 20 b to give 21 a and 21b, respectively, which were then dearomatized with Pb(OAc)4 and dichlorinated at C-2 with NCS in a one-pot process to give 22a/22b (Scheme 3). LDA-mediated dech-lorination and basic hydrolysis of 22 a/22b gave 23a/23 b, which were re-chlorinated using NCS to give 24 a/24b in good yield over 3 steps. Acetate hydrolysis of 22 a/22b to give 24a/ 24b directly was impossible due to competing fragmentation through a haloform reaction. MOM removal at the C-8 phenol also occurred during the KOH-mediated acetate hydrolysis step. Heating 24 a/24b in PhMe at 110 8C induced a thermal a-hydroxyketone rearrangement to give 25a/25 b. The a-hydroxyketone rearrangement of 24a/24 b was not found to be catalyzed by protic or Lewis acids, and attempts to catalyze the reaction with base led to fragmentation. Treat-ment of 25 a/25b with Cs2CO3 in THF formed a-chloroep-oxides 26a/26 b, which were reduced with Zn in MeOH to Scheme 3. Biomimetic total synthesis of the naphterpin/marinone biosynthetic pathway. MOM=methoxymethyl, THF = tetrahydrofuran, NCS =N-give 27a/27 b in high yield.[21] Oxidation of 27 a/27 b with TEMPO/PhI(OAc)2 [22] in Et2O then gave tricycles 28a/28b through oxa-6p-electrocyclization. As has been observed previously, 6p-electrocyclization is usually kinetically favored over an intramolecular hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction in such systems.[5] However, heating 28 a/28b with SnCl4 in EtOH caused isomerization (and MOM removal) to give 1 in 39% yield (after recrystallization from EtOAc as an orange solid) or 4 in 16 % yield through a cascade of retro-oxa-6p-electrocyclization, alkene isomerization, and a final intra-molecular hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction of the presumed intermediates 18a/18b. The yield of 4 is lower than the yield of 1, probably due to the instability of the exposed prenyl group of 4 in the presence of SnCl4. Our total syntheses of 7-demethylnaphterpin (1) and debromomarinone (4) are the first for members of the naphterpin/marinone family, but more efficient strategies for constructing these natural products can be envisaged. Indeed, a previous non-biomimetic synthesis of a protected form of 1 is shorter.[23] However, the value of our synthesis lies not in the final destination, but in the journey, since each step of the synthesis represents a potential biosynthetic inter-mediate (after facile MOM removal). The dearomatized biosynthetic intermediates 12a/b, 13 a/b and 15 a/b were prepared through this route (Scheme 4c) for use as standards in biosynthetic studies. To interrogate the individual biosyn-thetic steps, three VCPO homologues: marH1, marH2, and marH3, were individually cloned from the putative Strepto-myces sp. CNQ-509 marinone biosynthetic gene cluster and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombi-nant proteins were purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatog-raphy and initially interrogated using the monochlorodime-done (MCD) assay (see Figures S4\u2013S6 in the Supporting Information). Two VCPO homologues (MarH1, MarH3) showed halogenation activity and were further examined using synthetic substrates. Thorough in vitro characterization of the reactions between pre-naphterpin (11 a) and pre-marinone (11b)[24] and the recombinant MarH enzymes was performed using reversed-phase HPLC to monitor the formation of biosyn-thetic intermediates (Schemes 4a, b and Figures S7\u2013S26).[25] In the presence of sodium vanadate and two stoichiometric equivalents of hydrogen peroxide, MarH1 catalyzed the oxidative dearomatization of 11 a/11b at C-4 and subsequent monochlorination at C-2, yielding 12 a/12b and 13a/13 b, respectively. Additional chlorination of 13a/13 b by MarH1 was not observed following incubation with excess hydrogen peroxide, so this substrate was then interrogated with MarH3. In vitro incubation of 13a/13 b with MarH3 subsequently catalyzed additional chlorination at C-2 and an a-hydrox-yketone rearrangement, moving the terpene sidechain from C-4 to C-3 to produce 15 a/15b. Furthermore, a one-pot reaction of 11 a/11b with MarH1, MarH3, and sodium vanadate yielded the dichlorinated 1,2-shifted 15a/15 b as Scheme 4. Reversed-phase HPLC chromatograms (300 nm) of MarH enzyme assays (i\u2013iv) and comparison to synthetic standards (v\u2013vii) with the major product; progression along the biosynthetic path-way was directly correlated to the number of molar equiv-alents of hydrogen peroxide added (Figures S15, S24). MarH2 failed to show any catalytic halogenating or a-hydroxyketone rearrangement activities with meroterpenoid substrates, either individually or in combination with other MarH enzymes. We rationalize its inactivity despite high sequence similarity with other VCPO enzymes as being due to substitution of the key vanadate-coordinating histidine resi-due with an asparagine[26] (Figure S2). In conclusion, we discovered that Streptomyces bacteria use VCPO enzymes to oxidize THN derivatives via cryptic chlorination in the biosynthesis of the naphterpin and marinone families of meroterpenoid natural products. The biosynthetic sequence is initiated by VCPO-mediated oxida-tive dearomatization and dichlorination, followed by an a-hydroxyketone rearrangement. Subsequent loss of chloride anion leaving groups allows the formation of the highly oxidized naphthoquinone core. We mimicked the entire biosynthetic pathway in biomimetic syntheses of 7-demethyl-naphterpin and debromomarinone that use simple reaction conditions to exploit the predisposed reactivity of the intermediates in a logical manner. Several proposed biosyn-thetic intermediates were also synthesized and used as substrates and standards to help elucidate the function of two VCPO enzymes, MarH1 and MarH3, which initiate marinone biosynthesis. Further work to discover and charac-terize enzymes that control the final steps of naphterpin/ marinone biosynthesis is underway.

Several structurally similar naphthoquinone meroterpenoids have been isolated from trees of the Bigno-niaceae family, such as pyranokunthone A, which was syn-thesized by Trauner using an intramolecular hetero-Diels\u2013 Alder reaction.[5] Presumably, a similar hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction is involved at a late stage of the biosynthesis of the naphterpins and marinones. However, in the case of these Streptomyces meroterpenoids, the mechanism of the biosyn-thesis of the highly oxidized naphthoquinone ring system is currently unknown. Although naphterpins and marinones have been shown to be biosynthesized from THN through 13C labeling studies,[6] the oxidation pattern of THN does not obviously correlate with the oxidation pattern of these natural",

        "products. Furthermore, THN is nucleophilic at C-2 and C-4, but the naphterpins and marinones possess an isoprene substituent at the non-nucleophilic C-3 position.",
        "We recently reported two vanadium-dependent chloro-peroxidase (VCPO)[7] enzymes, Mcl24 and NapH3,[8] that catalyze a-hydroxyketone rearrangements to shift terpene side chains[9] from C-4 to C-3 in merochlorin and napyradio-mycin biosynthesis, respectively (Scheme 1). Mcl24 catalyzes",
        "oxidative dearomatization and dichlorination of the THN ring system of 7 followed by a 1,2-shift to give 8, whereas NapH3 just catalyzes the 1,2-shift of 9 to give naphthomevalin",
        "(10), the simplest member of the napyradiomycin family. The discovery of these enzymes, combined with associated bio-mimetic synthetic work, led us to propose a biosynthesis of the napyradiomycins.[8] Herein, we extend this biosynthetic logic to include the naphterpins and marinones. Our proposed biosynthesis of 7-demethylnaphterpin (1) and debromomarinone (4) from THN is outlined in Scheme 2. Firstly, THN is known to be biosynthesized by the condensa-tion of five malonyl-coenzyme A units followed by aromati-zation of the resultant pentaketide under the control of a single type III polyketide synthase.[10] Next, we propose that THN undergoes geranylation or farnesylation at C-4 to give 11a and 11b. This reaction is putatively catalyzed in vivo by the NphB aromatic prenyltransferase in naphterpin biosyn-thesis[11] or by CnqP3 or CnqP4 in marinone biosynthesis.[12] We then propose that 11 a/11 b are subjected to VCPO-catalyzed oxidative dearomatization to initially give 12a/12 b, followed by VCPO-catalyzed chlorination at C-2 to give monochlorides 13 a/13b and dichlorides 14 a/14b. A VCPO-catalyzed a-hydroxyketone rearrangement (which shifts the geranyl substituent from C-4 to C-3) would then give 15a/15 b. Computational studies have shown that this rearrangement is thermodynamically favorable, and the proposed multi-tasking VCPO chemistry is analogous to the known reactivity of the VCPO Mcl24 in merochlorin biosynthesis (Scheme 1a).[8] Exposure of 15a/15 b to mildly basic conditions should induce cyclization to give a-chloroepoxides 16 a/16b. A similar cyclization has been proposed to occur in the biosynthesis of A80 915G from naphthomevalin.[13] A handful of marine a-chloroepoxide natural products have been previously reported,[14] but none have yet been proposed as intermediates in biosynthetic pathways. Next, we propose",
        "Scheme 1. VCPO enzymes known to catalyze a-hydroxyketone rear-",
        "reductive dehalogenation of a-chloroepoxides 16a/16b to give hydroxynaphthoquinones 17 a/17b. Related reductions of naphthoquinone epoxides to give naphthoquinones have been proposed in the biosynthesis and used in the biomimetic synthesis of zeylanone[15] and the juglocombins.[16] Impor-tantly, the C-7 methylated analogue of 17a, which we suggest is the direct biosynthetic precursor of naphterpin (2), has been isolated as a Streptomyces metabolite.[17]",
        "Next, oxidation and facile E-to-Z double-bond isomer-ization of 17a/17 b would give the reactive enones 18a/18 b, which could be converted to 7-demethylnaphterpin (1) and debromomarinone (4) through intramolecular hetero-Diels\u2013 Alder reactions. This oxidative cyclization is similar to the biosynthesis of D1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid from canna-bigerolic acid catalyzed by THCA synthase.[18] The proposed oxidation of 17 a/17 b also has precedent in the biosynthesis of chlorizidine A in a marine strain of Streptomyces.[19] The naphterpins and marinones are isolated as enantiopure compounds, so the oxidative cyclization of achiral 17a/17b must be under enzymatic stereocontrol. Finally, late-stage, vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase-catalyzed bromina-tion of 4 at C-5 or C-7 would give marinone (5) or isomarinone (6), respectively. Despite the absence of chlorine in the naphterpin and marinone natural products, we propose that this rather elaborate biosynthetic pathway involves cryptic chlorination[20] to selectively oxidize the THN ring and promote the a-hydroxyketone rearrangement. Genomic analyses of marinone-producing Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509 supports this biosynthetic hypothesis through the clustering of",
        "VCPO and aromatic prenyltransferase homologues with a THN synthase.[12] In the case of naphterpin biosynthesis, only three genes have yet been reported, none of which are VCPOs.[11a] We completed a total synthesis of the whole biosynthetic pathway leading to 7-demethylnaphterpin (1) and debromo-marinone (4) from a protected THN derivative using a sequence of key reactions that occur in the same order as the proposed biosynthesis. The synthesis was therefore designed to give access to as many proposed biosynthetic intermediates as possible, for use in later biosynthetic studies. Firstly, di-MOM-protected THN derivative 19 was gerany-lated[8] at C-4 with 20a or farnesylated with 20 b to give 21 a and 21b, respectively, which were then dearomatized with Pb(OAc)4 and dichlorinated at C-2 with NCS in a one-pot process to give 22a/22b (Scheme 3). LDA-mediated dech-lorination and basic hydrolysis of 22 a/22b gave 23a/23 b, which were re-chlorinated using NCS to give 24 a/24b in good yield over 3 steps. Acetate hydrolysis of 22 a/22b to give 24a/ 24b directly was impossible due to competing fragmentation through a haloform reaction. MOM removal at the C-8 phenol also occurred during the KOH-mediated acetate hydrolysis step. Heating 24 a/24b in PhMe at 110 8C induced a thermal a-hydroxyketone rearrangement to give 25a/25 b. The a-hydroxyketone rearrangement of 24a/24 b was not found to be catalyzed by protic or Lewis acids, and attempts to catalyze the reaction with base led to fragmentation. Treat-ment of 25 a/25b with Cs2CO3 in THF formed a-chloroep-oxides 26a/26 b, which were reduced with Zn in MeOH to",
        "Scheme 3. Biomimetic total synthesis of the naphterpin/marinone biosynthetic pathway. MOM=methoxymethyl, THF = tetrahydrofuran, NCS =N-",
        "give 27a/27 b in high yield.[21] Oxidation of 27 a/27 b with TEMPO/PhI(OAc)2 [22] in Et2O then gave tricycles 28a/28b through oxa-6p-electrocyclization. As has been observed previously, 6p-electrocyclization is usually kinetically favored over an intramolecular hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction in such systems.[5] However, heating 28 a/28b with SnCl4 in EtOH caused isomerization (and MOM removal) to give 1 in 39% yield (after recrystallization from EtOAc as an orange solid) or 4 in 16 % yield through a cascade of retro-oxa-6p-electrocyclization, alkene isomerization, and a final intra-molecular hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction of the presumed intermediates 18a/18b. The yield of 4 is lower than the yield of 1, probably due to the instability of the exposed prenyl group of 4 in the presence of SnCl4.",
        "Our total syntheses of 7-demethylnaphterpin (1) and debromomarinone (4) are the first for members of the naphterpin/marinone family, but more efficient strategies for constructing these natural products can be envisaged. Indeed, a previous non-biomimetic synthesis of a protected form of 1 is shorter.[23] However, the value of our synthesis lies not in the final destination, but in the journey, since each step of the synthesis represents a potential biosynthetic inter-mediate (after facile MOM removal). The dearomatized biosynthetic intermediates 12a/b, 13 a/b and 15 a/b were prepared through this route (Scheme 4c) for use as standards in biosynthetic studies. To interrogate the individual biosyn-thetic steps, three VCPO homologues: marH1, marH2, and",
        "marH3, were individually cloned from the putative Strepto-myces sp. CNQ-509 marinone biosynthetic gene cluster and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombi-nant proteins were purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatog-raphy and initially interrogated using the monochlorodime-done (MCD) assay (see Figures S4\u2013S6 in the Supporting Information). Two VCPO homologues (MarH1, MarH3) showed halogenation activity and were further examined using synthetic substrates. Thorough in vitro characterization of the reactions between pre-naphterpin (11 a) and pre-marinone (11b)[24] and the recombinant MarH enzymes was performed using reversed-phase HPLC to monitor the formation of biosyn-thetic intermediates (Schemes 4a, b and Figures S7\u2013S26).[25] In the presence of sodium vanadate and two stoichiometric equivalents of hydrogen peroxide, MarH1 catalyzed the oxidative dearomatization of 11 a/11b at C-4 and subsequent monochlorination at C-2, yielding 12 a/12b and 13a/13 b, respectively. Additional chlorination of 13a/13 b by MarH1 was not observed following incubation with excess hydrogen peroxide, so this substrate was then interrogated with MarH3. In vitro incubation of 13a/13 b with MarH3 subsequently catalyzed additional chlorination at C-2 and an a-hydrox-yketone rearrangement, moving the terpene sidechain from C-4 to C-3 to produce 15 a/15b. Furthermore, a one-pot reaction of 11 a/11b with MarH1, MarH3, and sodium vanadate yielded the dichlorinated 1,2-shifted 15a/15 b as",

        "the major product; progression along the biosynthetic path-way was directly correlated to the number of molar equiv-alents of hydrogen peroxide added (Figures S15, S24). MarH2 failed to show any catalytic halogenating or a-hydroxyketone rearrangement activities with meroterpenoid substrates, either individually or in combination with other MarH enzymes. We rationalize its inactivity despite high sequence similarity with other VCPO enzymes as being due to substitution of the key vanadate-coordinating histidine resi-due with an asparagine[26] (Figure S2).",
        "In conclusion, we discovered that Streptomyces bacteria use VCPO enzymes to oxidize THN derivatives via cryptic chlorination in the biosynthesis of the naphterpin and marinone families of meroterpenoid natural products. The biosynthetic sequence is initiated by VCPO-mediated oxida-tive dearomatization and dichlorination, followed by an a-hydroxyketone rearrangement. Subsequent loss of chloride anion leaving groups allows the formation of the highly oxidized naphthoquinone core. We mimicked the entire biosynthetic pathway in biomimetic syntheses of 7-demethyl-naphterpin and debromomarinone that use simple reaction conditions to exploit the predisposed reactivity of the intermediates in a logical manner. Several proposed biosyn-thetic intermediates were also synthesized and used as substrates and standards to help elucidate the function of two VCPO enzymes, MarH1 and MarH3, which initiate marinone biosynthesis. Further work to discover and charac-terize enzymes that control the final steps of naphterpin/ marinone biosynthesis is underway.",
