The emergence in the 1980s of combinatorial chemistry as a way to rapidly and efficiently produce massive chemical libraries that promised new drug leads inspired genetic engineers in the 1990s to follow suit. Their early efforts focused on reprogramming natural biosynthetic pathways by mixing and matching genes from known biosynthetic clusters to yield unnatural designer analogs of natural products dif-fering by a single methyl group, by the oxidation state of a C-O bond, or by more drastic differences in the scaffold itself. These studies, meant to fuse the capabilities of combinatorial chemistry with the genetic power and enzymatic prowess of biosynthesis, led to the concept of combinatorial biosynthesis1.Motivation in the field was high, as researchers anticipated that numerous \u2018unnatural\u2019 natural products with altered struc-tures could be produced, illuminating structure-activity relation-ships that are key for drug development purposes and improving pharmaceutical properties of clinically relevant compounds. Even today, the importance of natural products as drug leads cannot be overstated. They continue to account for the majority of anti-microbial and anticancer agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration2 while similarly serving as indispensable molecular probes in illuminating fundamental cellular processes3. Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry has severely cut back its support for natural products research in recent decades in favor of synthetic approaches to building chemical libraries that are more suitable for modern biological screening campaigns. Natural prod-ucts, however, have maintained a several-fold higher \u2018hit rate\u2019 than synthetic chemical libraries4 and continue to cover a much wider chemical-space landscape.By exploiting the substrate promiscuity of biosynthetic machin-ery, researchers indeed were able to create new compounds with altered structures. For example, spinetoram is a spinosyn-based insecticide that was successfully developed from natu-ral product derivatives through a combination of biological and chemical approaches. Marketed in 2007 with improved efficacy and an expanded spectrum5, it is a mixture of 3\u02b9-O-ethyl-5,6-dihydrospinosyn J (1) and 3\u02b9-O-ethylspinosyn L (2) (Fig. 1) synthe-sized by the chemical modification of spinosyns J and L produced by a Reinvigorating natural product combinatorial biosynthesis with synthetic biologyEunji Kim1, Bradley S Moore2,3* & Yeo Joon Yoon1*rhamnose 3\u02b9-O-methyltransferase\u2013inactivated Saccharopolyspora spinosa5. Although spinetoram was not developed solely by com-binatorial biosynthesis, this successful case strongly suggests that more potent natural product analogs can be discovered by com-binatorial biosynthesis. Yet limited knowledge about biosynthetic enzymes and pathways, for instance of the important roles played by the seemingly inert linker regions between enzymatic modules that were so often the site of genetic cutting and pasting, limited the scope of success, and even today we remain far from the envisioned future in which any desired small molecule could be programmed at will. We suggest that this gap is due to still-insufficient informa-tion about how individual biosynthetic enzymes function and how linked enzymatic modules function together and to limitations in the tools for rapidly testing relevant hypotheses. In this Perspective, we highlight successes in this area, identify open questions that are hindering further research and point to the growing synergies with synthetic biology that are galvanizing the field.In the beginningEarly bioengineering success was achieved with microbial pol-yketides (PKs) and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), compounds with important pharmaceutical capabilities such as antibacterial, anticancer and immunosuppressant activities6,7. Their respec-tive biosynthetic systems utilize simple malonate and amino acid building blocks to construct complex chemical structures in an assembly-line fashion whereby intermediates are successively built while transiently tethered to carrier proteins. Classical combinato-rial biosynthetic examples include the macrolide antibiotic eryth-romycin from a type I modular PK synthase (PKS)8, the aromatic PK actinorhodin from a type II PKS9 and the lipopeptide antibi-otic daptomycin from a NRP synthetase (NRPS)10,11. Hundreds of biosynthetic products (for example, compounds 3\u20135; Fig. 2) have been engineered in these systems by manipulating substrate input and enzymatic assembly-line context using a variety of strategies, including gene fusions, gene inactivations, gene replacements, enzyme domain substitutions and module exchanges10\u201313 (Fig. 2). In the case of daptomycin, for instance, the combined use of these approaches has generated over 120 novel lipopeptides (such as 5), some displaying improved therapeutic properties10,11 (Fig. 2c).1Department of Chemistry and Nano Science, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. 2Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA. 3Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA. *e-mail: bsmoore@ucsd.edu or joonyoon@ewha.ac.krNatural products continue to play a pivotal role in drug-discovery efforts and in the understanding of human health. The abil-ity to extend nature\u2019s chemistry through combinatorial biosynthesis\u2014altering functional groups, regiochemistry and scaffold backbones through the manipulation of biosynthetic enzymes\u2014offers unique opportunities to create natural product analogs. Incorporating emerging synthetic biology techniques has the potential to further accelerate the refinement of combinatorial biosynthesis as a robust platform for the diversification of natural chemical drug leads. Two decades after the field originated, we discuss the current limitations, the realities and the state of the art of combinatorial biosynthesis, including the engineer-ing of substrate specificity of biosynthetic enzymes and the development of heterologous expression systems for biosynthetic pathways. We also propose a new perspective for the combinatorial biosynthesis of natural products that could reinvigorate drug discovery by using synthetic biology in combination with synthetic chemistry.np g \u00a9  201 5 N at ur e A m er ic a,  Inc.

However, in recent years, the biosynthetic community has excelled at characterizing new enzymes and altering the properties of known biosynthetic enzymes, both of which have important implications for combinatorial biosynthesis.Newly characterized enzymes tend to fall into three camps: those responsible for constructing substrates, those responsible for assem-bling substrates into the main structure and those involved in prod-uct diversification. In the case of modular assembly-line PKS and NRPS machines, progress has been made in all three areas. These include new substrate pathways to assemble and incorporate a-sub-stituted malonyl thioesters into PKSs14 or nonproteinogenic amino acids into NRPSs15. Additional characterization of known types of tailoring enzymes that decorate these scaffolds, such as deoxyhex-oses for modifying diverse biosynthetic aglycones16, as well as the discovery of new tailoring enzymes, such as those responsible for simple to exotic redox, halogenation or alkylation reactions, offer new excitement for the bioengineering toolbox15,16. Unfortunately, the details of tailoring enzymes are beyond the scope of this article. Modification of known proteins through rational design, directed evolution or other engineering approaches has also enabled the expansion or alteration of substrate specificity.For example, the gatekeeper enzyme domain in modular PKSs is the acyltransferase (AT) domain that controls the selection and incorporation of monomeric building blocks or extender units (usually malonyl-, methylmalonyl-or ethylmalonyl-CoAs) for the construction of PK products. The restricted versatility of the PK extender unit has limited the generation of novel PK structures with diverse side chains. Over the past several years, however, the PKS substrate code has expanded significantly with the discovery of the crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (CCR) family of enzymes that catalyze the reductive carboxylation of a,b-unsaturated acyl-CoA precursors17. This expansion to rare acyl-CoA extender units such as haloethylmalonyl-CoA, allylmalonyl-CoA, isobutyrylmalonyl-CoA and benzylmalonyl-CoA extends the structural possibilities for adding bulky or reactive side chains to the PK backbone14. Often AT domains associated with CCR-generated extender units display flexible extender unit specificity, thereby providing opportunities to create diverse PKs with altered side chains. The AT domain of module 4 in the immunosuppressant FK506 PKS naturally accepts methylmalonyl-, ethylmalonyl-, propylmalonyl-and allylmalonyl-CoA substrates as well as unnatural acyl-CoAs derived from sup-plemented carboxylic acids that generate macrolide derivatives with modified C21 side chains (compounds 6\u20138). One of these novel compounds exhibited improved in vitro nerve regenerative activ-ity relative to the parent FK506 (Fig. 1)18. Similarly, the AT domain in AntD of the antimycin NRPS-PKS hybrid assembly line showed remarkable tolerance toward a variety of non-natural extender units, including the engineered and \u2018clickable\u2019 5-hexynylmalonyl-CoA19 as well as linear, branched, cyclic and halogenated extender units20. This tolerance was exploited to produce diverse antimycin analogs (9\u201312) with enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity and antifungal activity (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the de novo synthesis of 5-hexynyl-malonyl-CoA from three jamaicamide biosynthetic enzymes act-ing in coordination with the promiscuous antimycin CCR has been used to produce terminal alkyne-labeled natural products19.The incorporation of unnatural extender unit substrates, how-ever, requires specific partner ATs to allow for their selective attachment to the modular assembly line. Although some ATs exhibit broad substrate scopes, most are specific and narrow in scope. A minimally invasive strategy to alter AT specificity while maintaining protein integrity involves amino acid substitutions.

NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY | VOL 11 | SEPTEMBER 2015 | www.nature.com/naturechemicalbiology 651PERSPECTIVENATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY DOI: 10.1038/NCHEMBIO.1893In addition to this rational design approach in NRPS engineer-ing, directed evolution has been successfully applied to the repro-gramming of A domain specificity. For instance, the Val-activating A domain of AdmK within the hybrid andrimid NRPS-PKS path-way was engineered. Three of the most highly variant residues were selected among the specificity-conferring sites for saturation mutagenesis, and the resulting library created in the native pro-ducer, Pantoea agglomerans, was screened for the production of analogs by LC-MS analysis of the crude cell extract. As a result, four clones were isolated to produce andrimid derivatives, three of which (16\u201318) (Fig. 1) showed increased bioactivity against Staphylococcus aureus25. A key aspect of this study is the structure-based assay in the native producing host that permits a direct read-out of not only the engineered AdmK A domain\u2019s activity but also the com-bined output of downstream biosynthetic enzymes. However, the andrimid system is a relatively small NRPS, and the expandability of this structure-based screening method to multimodular NRPSs or PKSs needs to be tested further. In addition, this process requires a great deal of screening effort using LC-MS, and over ~14,000 clones of the library were screened to isolate the four clones producing andrimid analogs.Building up new machinesThese examples illustrate a few case studies in which unnatural build-ing blocks can be selectively incorporated into PKs or NRPs using noninvasively engineered AT or A domains. An alternate approach illustrate, molecular docking simulation of the erythromycin PKS module 6 AT with methylmalonyl-CoA docked into the active site helped identify a residue that appeared to determine extender unit side chain size. A mutation of this residue (Val295Ala) was subse-quently shown to incorporate the exogenously added non-natural extender unit 2-propargylmalonyl-SNAC (N-acetylcysteamine thi-oester) to produce 2-propargylerythromycin A (13)21 (Fig. 1). The expanded availability of new extender units derived from promis-cuous CCRs14 or malonyl-CoA synthetase (MatB)22 with naturally occurring or engineered promiscuous AT domains provides great potential for the biosynthesis of novel PKs with specifically altered side chains.In NRPS systems, the list of new nonproteinogenic amino acid substrates has ballooned to include hundreds of diverse struc-tures. The modification of the native adenylation (A) domains that control the entry of diverse amino acid substrates into the NRPS assembly line has proven most successful in engineering the selec-tive attachment of unnatural substrates. For instance, the specific-ity of the A domain of module 10 within the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) NRPS was modified by the introduction of a sin-gle mutation (Lys278Gln), changing its specificity from (2S,3R)-3-methyl-Glu (mGlu) and Glu to (2S,3R)-3-methyl-Gln (mGln) and Gln to produce the Gln-and mGln-containing CDA analogs (14 and 15) (Fig. 1)23. A similar point mutation in the Phe-specific A domain of the gramicidin synthetase GrsA (Trp239Ser) allowed the introduction of an O-propargyl-Tyr residue24.Figure 2 | General strategies for the combinatorial biosynthesis of PKs and NRPs.

Most modular PKS and NRPS proteins construct their products via a linear assembly-line process in which each and every enzymatic domain is used once per assembled product6,7. In some cases, however, enzymatic domains or modules are entirely skipped or are used more than once, resulting in diversity elabora-tion. One of the more remarkable multitasking synthetases is the hybrid PKS-NRPS associated with the thalassospiramide family of calpain inhibitors from Thalassospira marine a-proteobacteria, where 16 lipocyclic peptides result from an assortment of amino acid substrates being channeled through enzymatic multimodule skipping and iteration reactions34. This extreme natural example reveals that assembly-line systems are amenable for library con-struction, yet the programming rules are not understood.Recently, a ratchet mechanism was proposed that ensures the unidirectional transport of a growing PK chain along the PKS35. Based on this model, module 3 of the erythromycin PKS was reprogramed to catalyze two rounds of chain elongation in suc-cession by employing an engineered ACP domain, in which the N terminus region that principally interacts upstream from the keto-synthase (KS)-AT didomain was replaced with the corresponding sequence from ACP domain of module 2 to permit back-transfer of the chain-elongation product that initially forms to the KS domain of module 3 (ref. 35). Additionally, the corresponding PKS and NRPS subunits must interact with their appropriate partners, and these interactions are mediated in part by docking domains36,37 and communication-mediating domains38, respectively, at the termini of the subunits. Using the recently characterized docking domains from the cyanobacterial curacin A PKS, it was demonstrated that the selectivity of docking interactions could be altered by site-directed mutagenesis39. These examples provide compelling case studies demonstrating that the combination of basic and applied science can enable future efforts in the fine reprogramming of hybrid megasynthase.is to replace native domains with domains from other pathways that already contain the desired specificities. For example, orthogonal trans-AT PKSs, in which the AT domain is located on a freestand-ing enzyme instead of on the multimodular synthase26, provide one successful case study of domain swapping. These domains are typi-cally dedicated to malonyl-CoA, but the trans-AT protein KirCII from the kirromycin PKS is naturally specific for ethylmalonyl-CoA and possess a relaxed specificity toward non-natural extender units in vitro22. Notably, the trans-acting AT from the disorazole PKS allowed for the efficient incorporation of fluoromalonyl-CoA in a cis-AT-inactivated unimodular or bimodular erythromycin PKS model system to produce novel fluorinated PKs such as 2-methyl-4-fluoro-tetraketide lactone (19) and 2-fluoro-4-methyl-tetraketide lactone (20) (Fig. 1)27.Although this example provides one success story for AT domain replacements, the strategy typically results in impaired protein folding or interactions that often significantly reduce biosynthetic productivity28. Efforts to create new NRP analogs by swapping A domains similarly result in reduced product yields as compared to those of native systems10,11,15. Although it has been demonstrated that directed evolution can improve the productivity of an engineered NRPS replaced with a heterolo-gous A domain29, maintaining the functional integrity of these megasynthases during domain replacements or insertions remains a substantial challenge given our limited understanding of the structural and temporal restrictions of this complex machinery: that is, the mode, timing, and consequences of the inter-and intra-molecular interactions of megasynthases. Recent structural stud-ies of NRPS30 and PKS assembly lines31,32 have provided insight into some of the intramolecular contacts and motions of these proteins (see p. 660). A recently developed thiocyanate vibra-tional spectroscopic probe installed on the terminal thiol of the ACP\u2019s 4\u02b9-phosphopantetheine arm33, which enables the observa-tion of ACP conformational changes during biosynthesis, will also be a useful tool for comprehending PKS operating principles and designing productive hybrid PKSs.

LLHR was successfully used for the direct cloning of ten unknown PKS/NRPS gene clusters from Photorhabdus luminescens into E. coli, circumventing library construction, stepwise stitching and screen-ing. Two of these gene clusters were successfully expressed in E. coli and produced the compounds designated as luminmide A (21) and luminmycin A (22) (Fig. 4)47. Although LLHR allows quick and effi-cient direct cloning of a target DNA sequence from a genomic DNA template, the ultimate efficiency of this approach is limited by the size of the target cluster, and two steps of LLHR would be required for the direct cloning of gene clusters larger than 60 kb.In addition to these phage-mediated homologous recombination methods, transformation-associated recombination (TAR)-based techniques that take advantage of the native in vivo homologous recombination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae48 have been developed to directly capture gene clusters from environmental DNA samples or large genomic loci (Fig. 3). By using a combination of environmen-tal DNA library screening and TAR to assemble the biosynthetic machinery on the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), the novel natural products fluostatin F, G and H (23\u201325) (ref. 49) and penta-cyclic ring 26 (ref. 50) were successfully produced in Streptomyces albus (Fig. 4). More recently, a cosmid-based TAR system has been developed. This S. cerevisiae\u2013E. coli shuttle\u2013actinobacterial chro-mosome integrative capture vector (named pCAP01) can be kept at multiple copies in E. coli because it contains the cosmid-derived pUC origin of replication. This supplies an ample amount of plas-mid DNA without induction, in contrast to BAC-based TAR sys-tems. With this method, a silent 67-kb NRPS gene cluster from the marine actinomycete Saccharomonospora sp. CNQ-490 was cap-tured, activated and expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor, yielding Synthetic biology to the rescueUntil recently, a major impediment to combinatorial biosynthe-sis was the lack of available DNA sequences for natural product biosynthetic genes. Now that advanced sequencing technologies have created an enormous pool of natural product biosynthetic genes, new methods for the rapid assembly of large gene clusters are needed40\u201342. Multidisciplinary synthetic biology approaches are poised to enable combinatorial biosynthesis studies to become faster and more accurate15,43 by providing genetic tools to enable the rapid assembly and refactoring of large biosynthetic genes and by pro-viding a series of optimized hosts or \u2018chassis\u2019 for the heterologous expression of diverse biosynthetic pathways. Specifically, a variety of newly available ligation-based and homology-based synthetic biol-ogy techniques have now been developed for DNA assembly44,45. Homology-based methods have been extensively used for the het-erologous expression of natural product gene clusters, and studies in which these techniques have been successfully used to produce natural products are highlighted below.Conventional Red/ET recombineering is an in vivo phage-mediated homologous recombination\u2013based method used in Escherichia coli between linear and replicating circular DNA (lin-ear-plus-circular homologous recombination, LCHR) that is cata-lyzed by Redabg from the coliphage l Red system or by a truncated version of RecE along with RecT from the Rac prophage (Fig. 3)46. LCHR was successfully used to exchange single or multiple domains for the combinatorial biosynthesis of the daptomycin deriva-tives described above10,11. Over the past decade, a range of natural product gene clusters have been heterologously expressed by this method40. In spite of this success, Red/ET recombineering becomes difficult when assembling large clusters cloned on multiple overlap-ping clones since stepwise recombination with a unique selectable maker is required.

Although the construct size that can be assembled in vitro seem to be smaller than that in vivo, a distinct advantage of in vitro DNA assembly is that it can be accom-plished in hours, whereas in vivo methods can take days.Toward optimal chassis for heterologous biosynthesisSequences from diverse bacteria, such as myxobacteria and cyano-bacteria40, from fungi40 and from plants57, and even environmental DNA41, are now increasingly available in biosynthetic engineer-ing experiments. With the development of diverse and facile DNA assembly techniques, robust chassis strains are also needed for the successful heterologous production of new natural products using this remarkably increased and publicly available (meta)genomic sequence information and further combinatorial biosynthesis.Currently, the choice of a suitable chassis is often deter-mined by the source of the target pathway and the metabolite type. Although there is no universal chassis available, the most widely used microbial chassis are Streptomyces species and E. coli. Streptomyces species have several advantages. First, as this bacte-rial genus supports most biosynthetic pathways, secondary meta-bolic biosynthetic precursors are readily available from primary metabolism. Second, as Streptomyces are physiologically differ-ent from E. coli (for example, having high GC content and Gram positive), their proteins, promoters, activators and regulatory pro-cesses are often not compatible with those in E. coli. And third, Streptomyces support distinct post-translational modification enzymes (for example, phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) responsible for adding a 4\u02b9-phosphopantetheine group to PKS and NRPS carrier proteins) that is required for functional biosyn-thetic enzymes. Although many different Streptomyces hosts have been used for the expression of heterologous genes, S. coelicolor, S. lividans, S. albus and the avermectin producer Streptomyces avermitilis are the most commonly employed. Removal of endoge-nous secondary metabolite genes from the chassis strain is advan-tageous because precursors and energy are then redirected for the production of the heterologous compound and because a cleaner metabolite background simplifies the detection and purification of the heterologous compound. To this end, variant strains of S. coelicolor58 and S. avermitilis59 were constructed, in which active biosynthetic gene clusters were eliminated. The feasibility of these mutants as efficient chassis was shown by the successful produc-tion of a variety of natural products derived from other actinomy-cetes and plants58\u201361.a dihalogenated derivative of daptomycin, taromycin A (27) (ref. 51) (Fig. 4). This direct cloning approach, which allows for a single genomic capture and expression vector, is compatible with next-generation technology that does not require large-insert clonal libraries. These TAR-based methods are compatible with Red/ET recombination-mediated PCR targeting52 for gene replacement to support subsequent engineering of the assembled gene cluster.Another TAR-based method, \u201cDNA assembler,\u201d enables conven-ient gene deletions and replacements. With DNA assembler, genetic fragments encoding the biosynthetic pathway of interest and required for DNA replication in S. cerevisiae, E. coli and other heter-ologous hosts are designed to overlap with two adjacent fragments amplified from the native producer genome or the corresponding vectors; these are subsequently co-transformed into S. cerevisiae for homologous recombination (Fig. 3). Recently, the ~29-kb aure-othin pathway was assembled by seven 4-to 5-kb fragments using the DNA assembler method and was expressed in Streptomyces liv-idans, producing aureothin53. In addition, because this method only requires adding site-specific mutations into the PCR primers for site-directed mutagenesis, the DH domain of the AurB PKS was readily inactivated to generate the aureothin analog 28 (ref. 53) (Fig. 4). However, with the DNA assembler method, random mutations are likely to occur as a result of the multiple PCR amplification steps. Moreover, mutations, deletions or insertions can be introduced if fragments pair incorrectly during the assembly process, particularly when PKS or NRPS domains show high sequence identity.One of the best-known in vitro homology-based methods is the one-pot isothermal assembly known as \u201cGibson assembly\u201d54, in which DNA fragments with overlapping sequences are joined via three enzymatic reactions. First, T5 exonuclease degrades the 5\u02b9 ends of each fragment to expose their complementary single-stranded 3\u02b9 ends, which then anneal to each other in the designed order with single-stranded gaps; these are filled by Phusion polymerase, and then the nicks are sealed by Taq ligase to produce the final product. Sequence-and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC)55 is one vari-ation of this in vitro homology-based method, in which T4 DNA polymerase is used for both 3\u02b9 single-strand degradation and partial gap-filling (Fig. 3). SLIC has been applied to the combinatorial bio-synthesis of premonensin derivatives56. Mutated fragments of b-car-bon processing domains of the type I monensin PKS were rapidly cloned into the temperature-sensitive shuttle vector using SLIC and were introduced through in-place homologous recombination into the chromosomal monensin PKS genes of Streptomyces cinnamon-ensis A495, yielding a library of 22 premonensin redox derivatives of Figure 5 | Representative synthetic biology tools for optimization of the expression of combinatorially assembled biosynthetic machineries.

This E. coli platform was fur-ther applied to the production of erythromycin analogs (34 and 35) (Fig. 4) by replacing the loading module and altering the extender unit specificity of the second module, respectively65. NRPs such as echinomycin from Streptomyces lasaliensis66, syringolin derivatives derived from Pseudomonas syringae67 and alterochromide lipo-peptides from Pseudoalteromonas piscicida JCM 20779 (ref. 68), as well as the NRP-PK hybrid antimycin from S. albus or Streptomyces ambofaciens69, were also produced in E. coli. These results demon-strate that E. coli is undoubtedly an interesting alternative chassis for heterologous expression and further combinatorial biosynthesis.In addition to Streptomyces and E. coli, other hosts such as Pseudomonas putida, Myxococcus xanthus and S. cerevisiae have also been widely used for the heterologous production of natural products40. It is worth noting that S. cerevisiae is a viable chassis for the heterologous production of plant and fungal metabolites. Reconstitution of plant pathways in yeast has proved to be a prom-ising approach to access plant metabolites such as the terpenoid antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid70 and strictosidine, the last common biosynthetic intermediate for all monoterpene indole alkaloids71. The iterative fungal PKS LovB from the lovas-tatin pathway of Aspergillus terreus was also successfully recon-stituted in S. cerevisiae72. Recently, another efficient system for the heterologous expression of fungal gene clusters in Aspergillus nidulans was developed. The asperfuranone PKS gene cluster from A. terreus was assembled using fusion PCR and in vivo homolo-gous recombination during transformation under the controllable alcA promoter in A. nidulans where its own cryptic asperfuranone cluster was deleted. The resulting A. nidulans mutant produced ~7 mg/l of asperfuranone73. It is possible that this system may work for other clusters of different metabolite types or derived from fungi other than Aspergillus, thus providing a general system for fungal metabolite production.Despite these advances, a single all-purpose chassis capable of producing large quantities of diverse natural products has not yet been developed. Perhaps that is an unrealistic expectation. Rather, it is more realistic to envision the development of a set of genetically tractable, genome-minimized hosts optimized for each metabo-lite type to be capable of supplying the precursors for the targeted secondary metabolites and efficiently expressing the target biosyn-thetic pathways in a controllable manner (for example, Streptomyces species for large microbial PKSs or NRPSs; E. coli for small PKSs, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RIPPs), or other small enzymes; and yeast for plant and fungal enzymes). Potential synthetic biology tools for biosynthesisAlthough most existing synthetic biology tools are designed for E. coli and may not be directly applicable to combinatorial biosyn-thesis in actinomycetes, advancements in synthetic biology meth-odology offer new approaches to address the problems associated with combinatorial biosynthesis (Figs. 5 and 6). For example, it is now possible to use synthetic DNA to functionally reconstitute large PKS-NRPS pathways, thereby enabling the use of optimized codons in desirable hosts (Fig. 5). A promising family of anticancer drugs, the epothilones, is biosynthesized by a hybrid NRPS-PKS in the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, which is notorious for its difficult genetic manipulation and very slow growth rate. Therefore, attempts have been made to express the codon-optimized synthetic epothilone gene cluster into faster-growing and more genetically tractable chassis. To this end, the entire ~55-kb GC-rich epothilone gene cluster was codon-optimized to ensure efficient translation, redesigned to place a strategic restriction site, and synthesized to express these large proteins in E. coli. The expression of the largest tetramodular EpoD (765 kDa) containing PKS modules 3\u20136 required Another efficient strategy is to use industrial overproduction strains that have already been optimized by conventional muta-tion. The overproduction properties of the \u2018clean-host\u2019 derivative of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea industrial strain were exploited to enhance titers of heterologous PKs. An approximately ten-fold higher production of erythromycin analogs (32 and 33) (Fig. 4) was observed in the engineered S. erythraea overproducer by chromo-somal integration of engineered PKSs as compared to S. lividans62. This suggested that the characteristics of the overproducing strain are primarily due to mutations in non-PKS genes and thus oper-ate equally well on other PKSs. Multi-gram quantities of tetra-cenomycins were produced by the heterologous expression of type II tetracenomycin PKS genes from Streptomyces glaucescens in an S. cinnamonensis strain producing high levels of monensin A63.Interestingly, the deletion of the monensin biosynthetic genes did not affect the production of tetracenomycin.Despite these successful examples of actinomycete chassis, E. coli still offers certain advantages in terms of a much faster growth rate and a variety of facile genetic tools. One of the disadvantages of E. coli as a chassis is that not all of the biosynthetic machinery, such as PPTase, or substrates, such as methylmalonyl-CoA, are available. Nonetheless, the first successful production of a type I PK product, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (the PK aglycone core of erythromycin A), was achieved using an E. coli host (termed BAP1) engineered to be capable of post-translationally modifying PKS ACP domains and of supplying methylmalonyl-CoA in sufficient amounts64. More recently, reconstitution of the entire erythromycin pathway in E. coli was attempted; erythromycin A was successfully heterologously pro-duced in E. coli using six plasmids harboring three large PKS genes Double-strand breakDNA repairEngineered genomeTranscription mRNA Paired-terminus asRNA sRNA Hfq protein Original genomePAM sgRNA Cas9 Diverse genomesOligonucleotides(ii) MAGEContinuous generation (i) CRISPR/Cas system(iii) asRNA-mediated RNA silencing(iv) sRNA-mediated RNA silencingFigure 6 | Representative synthetic biology tools for optimization of producing hosts.

The combined use of an alternative promoter, lowered temperature and coexpression of chaperones led to the production of soluble proteins from all epothilone biosyn-thetic genes and the subsequent production of epothilones C and D at <1 mg/l in a strain of E. coli BAP1 (ref. 74). Similarly, the function-ality of the codon-optimized artificial pathway was demonstrated by the heterologous production of epothilones A and B (~100 mg/l) in M. xanthus75. Although the reconstitution of large PKS or NRPS biosynthetic pathways using synthetic genes has so far only been demonstrated for the epothilones, the achieved low production yields suggest that unknown fundamental constraints might limit the utilization of artificial DNA for the production of certain classes of PK or NRP natural products.Additionally, there are opportunities to engineer the spatial organization of biosynthetic enzymes. Synthetic scaffolds based on protein, RNA and DNA have been successfully engineered to co-localize proteins and to increase the yield of the biosynthetic path-way by increasing the spatial proximity of biosynthetic enzymes, optimizing their local stoichiometry, and minimizing the loss of intermediates while avoiding accumulation of toxic intermediates (Fig. 5). In particular, a protein scaffold built using the protein-protein interaction domains of signaling proteins to recruit meta-bolic enzymes fused with their specific peptide ligands was used to co-localize and control the stoichiometry of three mevalonate biosynthesis enzymes. Significant (77-fold) increases in mevalonate production were observed by introducing several of these scaf-folds in E. coli76. Alternatively, RNA aptamer\u2013based scaffolds, in which RNA aptamers incorporated into the scaffolds recruited the appropriately tagged enzymes to precise positions on the scaf-fold, have been reported to control the spatial organization of two enzymes involved in hydrogen production, yielding a 48-fold increase in hydrogen production over that of a system without the scaffold77. More recently, DNA scaffolds built by creating chimeras between biosynthetic enzymes and zinc-finger domains that bind DNA sequences in a controlled order were used to moderate titer enhancement (up to five-fold) of resveratrol, 1,2-propanediol and mevalonate in E. coli78. Despite the potential disadvantages of these synthetic scaffold systems, such as the instability of the scaffolds, these examples suggest the potential use of artificial scaffold systems to efficiently co-localize and control the stoichiometry of individual enzymes in non-PKS or NRPS pathways.Moreover, promising fine-tunable libraries of promoters79 and ribosome binding sites (RBSs)80 can control the relative amounts of individual enzymes at both the transcriptional and translational levels in E. coli. Recently, a synthetic promoter library for actino-mycetes based on the randomization of the \u201310 and \u201335 consensus sequence of the widely used constitutive promoter ermEp 1 from S. erythraea was also constructed, displaying 2\u2013319% of ermEp 1 activity. The strongest synthetic promoter was used to express a type III PKS RppA from of S. erythraea, and an approximately three-fold increase in flaviolin production was observed as compared with that for the ermEp 1* promoter (a strong variant of ermEp 1) in S. lividans (Fig. 5)81.High-throughput genome editing tools, such as the clus-tered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein (CRISPR/Cas) system82, and genomic evolution technology, such as the multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE)83, are now available for the efficient engineering of microbial hosts for heterologous expression and combinatorial biosynthesis via chromosomal deletion, the addi-tion or alteration of the specific sequences or the fine-tuning of expression level of multiple targeted genes (Fig. 6). In the type II CRISPR/Cas system, which provides bacterial immunity against foreign DNA via RNA-guided DNA cleavage, short foreign \u2018spacer\u2019 DNAs are integrated within the CRISPR genomic loci and transcribed into short CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) that anneal to trans-activating crRNAs (tracrRNAs) to direct sequence-specific cleavage of foreign DNA by Cas9 proteins. Recent evi-dence suggests that the Cas9\u2013crRNA\u2013tracrRNA complex can target any protospacer DNA sequence when the requisite NGG protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) is present at the 3\u02b9 end. The spacer sequences matching target genomic loci can be directly programmed into a heterologously expressed CRISPR array, and the crRNA and tracrRNA can be fused to create a chimeric single-guide RNA (sgRNA) for further simplification. The CRISPR/Cas system can be reconstituted in a range of hosts including human cells84, S. cerevisiae85, E. coli86 and different Streptomyces species87, demonstrating the potential for multiplex genome editing (Fig. 6). However, further studies are needed to assess its utility, includ-ing the extent to which off-target effects occur. As an alternative, MAGE is an efficient method for generating targeted diversity on a genome scale to achieve the coordinated expression of individual genes for maximum efficiency of the host system. Single-stranded oligonucleotides can be used to target multiple short DNA for directed evolution through mismatches, insertion and deletion in the E. coli genome. The oligonucleotides can be sequentially trans-formed into the same E. coli population, allowing the targeted modification to accumulate at different chromosome sites. The efficiency of MAGE was demonstrated by the isolation of an E. coli variant with a more than five-fold increase in lycopene production within 3 days (Fig. 6)83. However, because this technology requires an efficient transformation and single-stranded oligonucleotide-mediated allelic replacement, it may not be amenable to wider use in other organisms and has not been adapted for use in actinomy-cetes with a high GC content.Additionally, antisense RNA (asRNA)-mediated gene silencing is also an effective strategy to engineer the host without genome edit-ing or gene knockouts that can cause host instability or may result in decreased growth rates. This approach has been used in E. coli and also in other bacteria, including S. coelicolor, where antisense RNA silencers successfully inhibited actinorhodin production (Fig. 6)88. In addition, this approach has recently been used with small regu-latory RNAs (sRNAs), short noncoding RNAs in prokaryotes that control target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and can thus be used to control gene expression in E. coli (Fig. 6). Engineered synthetic sRNAs consist of a target-binding sequence complementary to the target mRNA and a scaffold for recruiting the Hfq protein, which helps the hybridization of sRNA to the target mRNA and the subsequent degradation. Using this strategy to com-binatorially knock down candidate genes in different strains, an E. coli strain was isolated that produces 2 g/l of tyrosine89. This method is useful for large-scale target identification and for modulating chromosomal gene expression without modifying these genes, but unfortunately, its applicability to hosts other than E. coli has not yet been shown.When developed for use in a wider range of chassis, including the most prolific natural product\u2013producing actinomycetes, the synthetic biology tools listed above will facilitate essential combi-natorial biosynthesis studies aimed at broadening the scope of bio-synthetic building blocks and enzymes and developing efficient and robust heterologous expression systems. For instance, the spatial organization and stoichiometry of the enzymes expressed from the codon-optimized synthetic genes can be engineered using synthetic scaffolds in desirable hosts in which their precursor supply, regu-latory networks and other production properties are optimized by CRISPR/Cas, MAGE or sRNA methods.Perspective To be useful for drug discovery, large chemical libraries need to be generated for screening, but in most applications, the combinatorial np g \u00a9  201 5 N at ur e A m er ic a,  Inc.

NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY | VOL 11 | SEPTEMBER 2015 | www.nature.com/naturechemicalbiology 657PERSPECTIVENATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY DOI: 10.1038/NCHEMBIO.1893biosynthesis of natural products is not truly \u2018combinatorial\u2019. Rather, this process creates small, focused libraries of natural products that can still reduce costs and time associated with drug discovery due to the significantly higher hit rate for natural products and their derivatives4. Combining biosynthesis and synthetic organic chem-istry allows combinatorial biosynthesis to be \u2018more combinatorial\u2019 and provide greater promise in delivering chemical libraries for lead optimization and structure-activity relation studies. Recently, the multiplex combinatorial biosynthesis of a total 380 antimycin derivatives (for example, 10\u201312), of which 356 were new, was real-ized by combining multiple mutasyntheses at different biosynthetic stages with the chemistry needed to provide unnatural precursors and to modify the alkyne-bearing variants via click chemistry20. In another example, the chlorine installed on pacidamycin by the expression of a heterologous halogenase was used as a selective handle for further synthetic diversification to generate four new analogs (36\u201339) (Fig. 4) using mild cross-coupling conditions in crude aqueous extracts of the culture broth90. Although conven-tional chemical methods for structural diversification will remain an indispensable technology, combinatorial biosynthesis reinvigor-ated by synthetic chemistry has now become an efficient alternative approach. Scientists in both fields should cooperate more closely to design useful analogs as well as to generate compounds that are dif-ficult to make by solely chemical means.Although early success stories focused on PKs and NRPs pri-marily from actinomycete bacteria, combinatorial biosynthesis has since been applied to many classes of natural products, including RIPPs91, saccharides92, terpenoids93 and alkaloids94 from assorted organisms. Because the non-modular biosynthetic machineries for these natural products are more amenable to combinatorial assembly than PKS and NRPS systems, they have huge potential to generate combinatorial biosynthetic libraries. For example, RIPP biosynthetic genes from cyanobacteria including the patellamide95 and cyanobactin pathways96 were functionally expressed in E. coli. In the latter case, rules for the sequence selectivity of a RIPP path-way were determined, suggesting that RIPP pathways are a promis-ing source for combinatorial engineering.Once we know what to make, the challenge remains how to make it at scale. Despite many successful examples of combinatorial bio-synthesis, the production of many natural products generated by combinatorial biosynthesis suffers from low productivity, ultimately delaying analysis in the lab and clinical testing or commercializa-tion of compounds with improved activity or pharmacokinetics. We posit that improved yields will be realized through the integration of emerging systems and synthetic biology techniques combined with traditional metabolic engineering to optimize chassis strains and expression systems, as exemplified by the industry-scale production of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid in engineered yeast70. With the increasing scientific understanding and technical capa-bilities gained over the last two decades, we argue that the basic foundation has been laid for the \u2018total biosynthesis\u2019 of designed nat-ural products or small, focused libraries solely through combinato-rial biosynthesis. Further investigations of biosynthetic systems will guide our strategies, synthetic biology will enable the construction of naturally unavailable but efficient biological machinery, and syn-thetic chemistry will allow us to install naturally unavailable chemi-cal functionalities to truly diversify nature\u2019s biosynthetic chemistry. We envision that in the not-too-distant future, the structures of target molecules derived either from unisolable or uncultivable natural sources or by rational design will be able to guide the ret-rosynthetic design of artificial biosynthetic genes using computa-tional tools97 (see p. 639) and allow them to be synthesized in parts. The resulting synthetic DNA can then be assembled into functional biosynthetic pathways and productively expressed in an optimized chassis for the de novo generation of these designed products. The feasibility of this envisioned future is exemplified in the construc-tion of the biosynthetic pathway of the antiviral nucleoside analog 2\u02b9,3\u02b9-dideoxyinosine (didanosine) in a retrograde fashion98. As the production of the final product is the only selection criterion in this \u2018bioretrosynthesis\u2019 approach, assay design and the screening of each biosynthetic step can be reduced. After directed evolution of the final and penultimate enzymes, purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 1,5-phosphopentomutase, respectively, the antepenultimate enzyme ribokinase was engineered unexpectedly to bypass the 1,5-phosphopentomutase step owing to the increased direct phos-phorylation activity of the anomeric hydroxyl group of the starting substrate dideoxyribose. This shortened pathway showed a 50-fold increase in didanosine production in vitro98.The field of combinatorial biosynthesis is now ready to tackle the current challenges in natural product drug development.Received 15 June 2015; accepted 22 July 2015; published online 18 August 2015; corrected after print 23 September 2015References 1.

        "10.1038/NCHEMBIO.1893Chemists have long had a fascination with controlling and extending nature\u2019s biosynthetic dexterity. The emergence in the 1980s of combinatorial chemistry as a way to rapidly and efficiently produce massive chemical libraries that promised new drug leads inspired genetic engineers in the 1990s to follow suit. Their early efforts focused on reprogramming natural biosynthetic pathways by mixing and matching genes from known biosynthetic clusters to yield unnatural designer analogs of natural products dif-fering by a single methyl group, by the oxidation state of a C-O bond, or by more drastic differences in the scaffold itself. These studies, meant to fuse the capabilities of combinatorial chemistry with the genetic power and enzymatic prowess of biosynthesis, led to the concept of combinatorial",
        "biosynthesis1.Motivation in the field was high, as researchers anticipated that numerous \u2018unnatural\u2019 natural products with altered struc-tures could be produced, illuminating structure-activity relation-ships that are key for drug development purposes and improving pharmaceutical properties of clinically relevant compounds. Even today, the importance of natural products as drug leads cannot be overstated. They continue to account for the majority of anti-microbial and anticancer agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration2 while similarly serving as indispensable molecular probes in illuminating fundamental cellular processes3. Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry has severely cut back its support for natural products research in recent decades in favor of synthetic approaches to building chemical libraries that are more suitable for modern biological screening campaigns. Natural prod-ucts, however, have maintained a several-fold higher \u2018hit rate\u2019 than synthetic chemical libraries4 and continue to cover a much wider chemical-space",
        "landscape.By exploiting the substrate promiscuity of biosynthetic machin-ery, researchers indeed were able to create new compounds with altered structures. For example, spinetoram is a spinosyn-based insecticide that was successfully developed from natu-ral product derivatives through a combination of biological and chemical approaches. Marketed in 2007 with improved efficacy and an expanded spectrum5, it is a mixture of 3\u02b9-O-ethyl-5,6-dihydrospinosyn J (1) and 3\u02b9-O-ethylspinosyn L (2) (Fig. 1) synthe-sized by the chemical modification of spinosyns J and L produced by a",

Although spinetoram was not developed solely by com-binatorial biosynthesis, this successful case strongly suggests that more potent natural product analogs can be discovered by com-binatorial biosynthesis. Yet limited knowledge about biosynthetic enzymes and pathways, for instance of the important roles played by the seemingly inert linker regions between enzymatic modules that were so often the site of genetic cutting and pasting, limited the scope of success, and even today we remain far from the envisioned future in which any desired small molecule could be programmed at will. We suggest that this gap is due to still-insufficient informa-tion about how individual biosynthetic enzymes function and how linked enzymatic modules function together and to limitations in the tools for rapidly testing relevant hypotheses. In this Perspective, we highlight successes in this area, identify open questions that are hindering further research and point to the growing synergies with synthetic biology that are galvanizing the",
        "field.In the beginningEarly bioengineering success was achieved with microbial pol-yketides (PKs) and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), compounds with important pharmaceutical capabilities such as antibacterial, anticancer and immunosuppressant activities6,7. Their respec-tive biosynthetic systems utilize simple malonate and amino acid building blocks to construct complex chemical structures in an assembly-line fashion whereby intermediates are successively built while transiently tethered to carrier proteins. Classical combinato-rial biosynthetic examples include the macrolide antibiotic eryth-romycin from a type I modular PK synthase (PKS)8, the aromatic PK actinorhodin from a type II PKS9 and the lipopeptide antibi-otic daptomycin from a NRP synthetase (NRPS)10,11. Hundreds of biosynthetic products (for example, compounds 3\u20135; Fig. 2) have been engineered in these systems by manipulating substrate input and enzymatic assembly-line context using a variety of strategies, including gene fusions, gene inactivations, gene replacements, enzyme domain substitutions and module exchanges10\u201313 (Fig. 2). In the case of daptomycin, for instance, the combined use of these approaches has generated over 120 novel lipopeptides (such as 5), some displaying improved therapeutic properties10,11 (Fig.",

Two decades after the field originated, we discuss the current limitations, the realities and the state of the art of combinatorial biosynthesis, including the engineer-ing of substrate specificity of biosynthetic enzymes and the development of heterologous expression systems for biosynthetic pathways.

However, in recent years, the biosynthetic community has excelled at characterizing new enzymes and altering the properties of known biosynthetic enzymes, both of which have important implications for combinatorial",
        "biosynthesis.Newly characterized enzymes tend to fall into three camps: those responsible for constructing substrates, those responsible for assem-bling substrates into the main structure and those involved in prod-uct diversification. In the case of modular assembly-line PKS and NRPS machines, progress has been made in all three areas. These include new substrate pathways to assemble and incorporate a-sub-stituted malonyl thioesters into PKSs14 or nonproteinogenic amino acids into NRPSs15. Additional characterization of known types of tailoring enzymes that decorate these scaffolds, such as deoxyhex-oses for modifying diverse biosynthetic aglycones16, as well as the discovery of new tailoring enzymes, such as those responsible for simple to exotic redox, halogenation or alkylation reactions, offer new excitement for the bioengineering toolbox15,16. Unfortunately, the details of tailoring enzymes are beyond the scope of this article. Modification of known proteins through rational design, directed evolution or other engineering approaches has also enabled the expansion or alteration of substrate",
        "specificity.For example, the gatekeeper enzyme domain in modular PKSs is the acyltransferase (AT) domain that controls the selection and incorporation of monomeric building blocks or extender units (usually malonyl-, methylmalonyl-or ethylmalonyl-CoAs) for the construction of PK products. The restricted versatility of the PK extender unit has limited the generation of novel PK structures with diverse side chains. Over the past several years, however, the PKS substrate code has expanded significantly with the discovery of the crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (CCR) family of enzymes that catalyze the reductive carboxylation of a,b-unsaturated acyl-CoA precursors17. This expansion to rare acyl-CoA extender units such as haloethylmalonyl-CoA, allylmalonyl-CoA, isobutyrylmalonyl-CoA and benzylmalonyl-CoA extends the structural possibilities for adding bulky or reactive side chains to the PK backbone14. Often AT domains associated with CCR-generated extender units display flexible extender unit specificity, thereby providing opportunities to create diverse PKs with altered side chains. The AT domain of module 4 in the immunosuppressant FK506 PKS naturally accepts methylmalonyl-, ethylmalonyl-, propylmalonyl-and allylmalonyl-CoA substrates as well as unnatural acyl-CoAs derived from sup-plemented carboxylic acids that generate macrolide derivatives with modified C21 side chains (compounds 6\u20138). One of these novel compounds exhibited improved in vitro nerve regenerative activ-ity relative to the parent FK506 (Fig. 1)18. Similarly, the AT domain in AntD of the antimycin NRPS-PKS hybrid assembly line showed remarkable tolerance toward a variety of non-natural extender units, including the engineered and \u2018clickable\u2019 5-hexynylmalonyl-CoA19 as well as linear, branched, cyclic and halogenated extender units20. This tolerance was exploited to produce diverse antimycin analogs (9\u201312) with enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity and antifungal activity (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the de novo synthesis of 5-hexynyl-malonyl-CoA from three jamaicamide biosynthetic enzymes act-ing in coordination with the promiscuous antimycin CCR has been used to produce terminal alkyne-labeled natural",
        "products19.The incorporation of unnatural extender unit substrates, how-ever, requires specific partner ATs to allow for their selective attachment to the modular assembly line. Although some ATs exhibit broad substrate scopes, most are specific and narrow in scope. A minimally invasive strategy to alter AT specificity while maintaining protein integrity involves amino acid substitutions. To",

        "10.1038/NCHEMBIO.1893In addition to this rational design approach in NRPS engineer-ing, directed evolution has been successfully applied to the repro-gramming of A domain specificity. For instance, the Val-activating A domain of AdmK within the hybrid andrimid NRPS-PKS path-way was engineered. Three of the most highly variant residues were selected among the specificity-conferring sites for saturation mutagenesis, and the resulting library created in the native pro-ducer, Pantoea agglomerans, was screened for the production of analogs by LC-MS analysis of the crude cell extract. As a result, four clones were isolated to produce andrimid derivatives, three of which (16\u201318) (Fig. 1) showed increased bioactivity against Staphylococcus aureus25. A key aspect of this study is the structure-based assay in the native producing host that permits a direct read-out of not only the engineered AdmK A domain\u2019s activity but also the com-bined output of downstream biosynthetic enzymes. However, the andrimid system is a relatively small NRPS, and the expandability of this structure-based screening method to multimodular NRPSs or PKSs needs to be tested further. In addition, this process requires a great deal of screening effort using LC-MS, and over ~14,000 clones of the library were screened to isolate the four clones producing andrimid",

        "strategies.Another area of assembly-line construction that is poorly understood involves iterative versus single-use modular bio-chemistry. Most modular PKS and NRPS proteins construct their products via a linear assembly-line process in which each and every enzymatic domain is used once per assembled product6,7. In some cases, however, enzymatic domains or modules are entirely skipped or are used more than once, resulting in diversity elabora-tion. One of the more remarkable multitasking synthetases is the hybrid PKS-NRPS associated with the thalassospiramide family of calpain inhibitors from Thalassospira marine a-proteobacteria, where 16 lipocyclic peptides result from an assortment of amino acid substrates being channeled through enzymatic multimodule skipping and iteration reactions34. This extreme natural example reveals that assembly-line systems are amenable for library con-struction, yet the programming rules are not",
        "understood.Recently, a ratchet mechanism was proposed that ensures the unidirectional transport of a growing PK chain along the PKS35. Based on this model, module 3 of the erythromycin PKS was reprogramed to catalyze two rounds of chain elongation in suc-cession by employing an engineered ACP domain, in which the N terminus region that principally interacts upstream from the keto-synthase (KS)-AT didomain was replaced with the corresponding sequence from ACP domain of module 2 to permit back-transfer of the chain-elongation product that initially forms to the KS domain of module 3 (ref. 35). Additionally, the corresponding PKS and NRPS subunits must interact with their appropriate partners, and these interactions are mediated in part by docking domains36,37 and communication-mediating domains38, respectively, at the termini of the subunits. Using the recently characterized docking domains from the cyanobacterial curacin A PKS, it was demonstrated that the selectivity of docking interactions could be altered by site-directed mutagenesis39. These examples provide compelling case studies demonstrating that the combination of basic and applied science can enable future efforts in the fine reprogramming of hybrid",

For example, orthogonal trans-AT PKSs, in which the AT domain is located on a freestand-ing enzyme instead of on the multimodular synthase26, provide one successful case study of domain swapping. These domains are typi-cally dedicated to malonyl-CoA, but the trans-AT protein KirCII from the kirromycin PKS is naturally specific for ethylmalonyl-CoA and possess a relaxed specificity toward non-natural extender units in vitro22. Notably, the trans-acting AT from the disorazole PKS allowed for the efficient incorporation of fluoromalonyl-CoA in a cis-AT-inactivated unimodular or bimodular erythromycin PKS model system to produce novel fluorinated PKs such as 2-methyl-4-fluoro-tetraketide lactone (19) and 2-fluoro-4-methyl-tetraketide lactone (20) (Fig.",
        "1)27.Although this example provides one success story for AT domain replacements, the strategy typically results in impaired protein folding or interactions that often significantly reduce biosynthetic productivity28. Efforts to create new NRP analogs by swapping A domains similarly result in reduced product yields as compared to those of native systems10,11,15. Although it has been demonstrated that directed evolution can improve the productivity of an engineered NRPS replaced with a heterolo-gous A domain29, maintaining the functional integrity of these megasynthases during domain replacements or insertions remains a substantial challenge given our limited understanding of the structural and temporal restrictions of this complex machinery: that is, the mode, timing, and consequences of the inter-and intra-molecular interactions of megasynthases. Recent structural stud-ies of NRPS30 and PKS assembly lines31,32 have provided insight into some of the intramolecular contacts and motions of these proteins (see p. 660). A recently developed thiocyanate vibra-tional spectroscopic probe installed on the terminal thiol of the ACP\u2019s 4\u02b9-phosphopantetheine arm33, which enables the observa-tion of ACP conformational changes during biosynthesis, will also be a useful tool for comprehending PKS operating principles and designing productive hybrid PKSs.

With the development of diverse and facile DNA assembly techniques, robust chassis strains are also needed for the successful heterologous production of new natural products using this remarkably increased and publicly available (meta)genomic sequence information and further combinatorial",
        "biosynthesis.Currently, the choice of a suitable chassis is often deter-mined by the source of the target pathway and the metabolite type. Although there is no universal chassis available, the most widely used microbial chassis are Streptomyces species and E. coli. Streptomyces species have several advantages. First, as this bacte-rial genus supports most biosynthetic pathways, secondary meta-bolic biosynthetic precursors are readily available from primary metabolism. Second, as Streptomyces are physiologically differ-ent from E. coli (for example, having high GC content and Gram positive), their proteins, promoters, activators and regulatory pro-cesses are often not compatible with those in E. coli. And third, Streptomyces support distinct post-translational modification enzymes (for example, phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) responsible for adding a 4\u02b9-phosphopantetheine group to PKS and NRPS carrier proteins) that is required for functional biosyn-thetic enzymes. Although many different Streptomyces hosts have been used for the expression of heterologous genes, S. coelicolor, S. lividans, S. albus and the avermectin producer Streptomyces avermitilis are the most commonly employed. Removal of endoge-nous secondary metabolite genes from the chassis strain is advan-tageous because precursors and energy are then redirected for the production of the heterologous compound and because a cleaner metabolite background simplifies the detection and purification of the heterologous compound. To this end, variant strains of S. coelicolor58 and S. avermitilis59 were constructed, in which active biosynthetic gene clusters were eliminated. The feasibility of these mutants as efficient chassis was shown by the successful produc-tion of a variety of natural products derived from other actinomy-cetes and",

This direct cloning approach, which allows for a single genomic capture and expression vector, is compatible with next-generation technology that does not require large-insert clonal libraries. These TAR-based methods are compatible with Red/ET recombination-mediated PCR targeting52 for gene replacement to support subsequent engineering of the assembled gene",
        "cluster.Another TAR-based method, \u201cDNA assembler,\u201d enables conven-ient gene deletions and replacements. With DNA assembler, genetic fragments encoding the biosynthetic pathway of interest and required for DNA replication in S. cerevisiae, E. coli and other heter-ologous hosts are designed to overlap with two adjacent fragments amplified from the native producer genome or the corresponding vectors; these are subsequently co-transformed into S. cerevisiae for homologous recombination (Fig. 3). Recently, the ~29-kb aure-othin pathway was assembled by seven 4-to 5-kb fragments using the DNA assembler method and was expressed in Streptomyces liv-idans, producing aureothin53. In addition, because this method only requires adding site-specific mutations into the PCR primers for site-directed mutagenesis, the DH domain of the AurB PKS was readily inactivated to generate the aureothin analog 28 (ref. 53) (Fig. 4). However, with the DNA assembler method, random mutations are likely to occur as a result of the multiple PCR amplification steps. Moreover, mutations, deletions or insertions can be introduced if fragments pair incorrectly during the assembly process, particularly when PKS or NRPS domains show high sequence",
        "identity.One of the best-known in vitro homology-based methods is the one-pot isothermal assembly known as \u201cGibson assembly\u201d54, in which DNA fragments with overlapping sequences are joined via three enzymatic reactions. First, T5 exonuclease degrades the 5\u02b9 ends of each fragment to expose their complementary single-stranded 3\u02b9 ends, which then anneal to each other in the designed order with single-stranded gaps; these are filled by Phusion polymerase, and then the nicks are sealed by Taq ligase to produce the final product. Sequence-and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC)55 is one vari-ation of this in vitro homology-based method, in which T4 DNA polymerase is used for both 3\u02b9 single-strand degradation and partial gap-filling (Fig. 3). SLIC has been applied to the combinatorial bio-synthesis of premonensin derivatives56. Mutated fragments of b-car-bon processing domains of the type I monensin PKS were rapidly cloned into the temperature-sensitive shuttle vector using SLIC and were introduced through in-place homologous recombination into the chromosomal monensin PKS genes of Streptomyces cinnamon-ensis A495, yielding a library of 22 premonensin redox derivatives of",

This E. coli platform was fur-ther applied to the production of erythromycin analogs (34 and 35) (Fig. 4) by replacing the loading module and altering the extender unit specificity of the second module, respectively65. NRPs such as echinomycin from Streptomyces lasaliensis66, syringolin derivatives derived from Pseudomonas syringae67 and alterochromide lipo-peptides from Pseudoalteromonas piscicida JCM 20779 (ref. 68), as well as the NRP-PK hybrid antimycin from S. albus or Streptomyces ambofaciens69, were also produced in E. coli. These results demon-strate that E. coli is undoubtedly an interesting alternative chassis for heterologous expression and further combinatorial",
        "biosynthesis.In addition to Streptomyces and E. coli, other hosts such as Pseudomonas putida, Myxococcus xanthus and S. cerevisiae have also been widely used for the heterologous production of natural products40. It is worth noting that S. cerevisiae is a viable chassis for the heterologous production of plant and fungal metabolites. Reconstitution of plant pathways in yeast has proved to be a prom-ising approach to access plant metabolites such as the terpenoid antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid70 and strictosidine, the last common biosynthetic intermediate for all monoterpene indole alkaloids71. The iterative fungal PKS LovB from the lovas-tatin pathway of Aspergillus terreus was also successfully recon-stituted in S. cerevisiae72. Recently, another efficient system for the heterologous expression of fungal gene clusters in Aspergillus nidulans was developed. The asperfuranone PKS gene cluster from A. terreus was assembled using fusion PCR and in vivo homolo-gous recombination during transformation under the controllable alcA promoter in A. nidulans where its own cryptic asperfuranone cluster was deleted. The resulting A. nidulans mutant produced ~7 mg/l of asperfuranone73. It is possible that this system may work for other clusters of different metabolite types or derived from fungi other than Aspergillus, thus providing a general system for fungal metabolite",
        "production.Despite these advances, a single all-purpose chassis capable of producing large quantities of diverse natural products has not yet been developed. Perhaps that is an unrealistic expectation. Rather, it is more realistic to envision the development of a set of genetically tractable, genome-minimized hosts optimized for each metabo-lite type to be capable of supplying the precursors for the targeted secondary metabolites and efficiently expressing the target biosyn-thetic pathways in a controllable manner (for example, Streptomyces species for large microbial PKSs or NRPSs; E. coli for small PKSs, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RIPPs), or other small enzymes; and yeast for plant and fungal enzymes).",
        "Potential synthetic biology tools for biosynthesisAlthough most existing synthetic biology tools are designed for E. coli and may not be directly applicable to combinatorial biosyn-thesis in actinomycetes, advancements in synthetic biology meth-odology offer new approaches to address the problems associated with combinatorial biosynthesis (Figs. 5 and 6). For example, it is now possible to use synthetic DNA to functionally reconstitute large PKS-NRPS pathways, thereby enabling the use of optimized codons in desirable hosts (Fig. 5). A promising family of anticancer drugs, the epothilones, is biosynthesized by a hybrid NRPS-PKS in the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, which is notorious for its difficult genetic manipulation and very slow growth rate. Therefore, attempts have been made to express the codon-optimized synthetic epothilone gene cluster into faster-growing and more genetically tractable chassis. To this end, the entire ~55-kb GC-rich epothilone gene cluster was codon-optimized to ensure efficient translation, redesigned to place a strategic restriction site, and synthesized to express these large proteins in E. coli. The expression of the largest tetramodular EpoD (765 kDa) containing PKS modules 3\u20136 required",
        "Another efficient strategy is to use industrial overproduction strains that have already been optimized by conventional muta-tion. The overproduction properties of the \u2018clean-host\u2019 derivative of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea industrial strain were exploited to enhance titers of heterologous PKs. An approximately ten-fold higher production of erythromycin analogs (32 and 33) (Fig. 4) was observed in the engineered S. erythraea overproducer by chromo-somal integration of engineered PKSs as compared to S. lividans62. This suggested that the characteristics of the overproducing strain are primarily due to mutations in non-PKS genes and thus oper-ate equally well on other PKSs. Multi-gram quantities of tetra-cenomycins were produced by the heterologous expression of type II tetracenomycin PKS genes from Streptomyces glaucescens in an S. cinnamonensis strain producing high levels of monensin A63.Interestingly, the deletion of the monensin biosynthetic genes did not affect the production of",
        "tetracenomycin.Despite these successful examples of actinomycete chassis, E. coli still offers certain advantages in terms of a much faster growth rate and a variety of facile genetic tools. One of the disadvantages of E. coli as a chassis is that not all of the biosynthetic machinery, such as PPTase, or substrates, such as methylmalonyl-CoA, are available. Nonetheless, the first successful production of a type I PK product, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (the PK aglycone core of erythromycin A), was achieved using an E. coli host (termed BAP1) engineered to be capable of post-translationally modifying PKS ACP domains and of supplying methylmalonyl-CoA in sufficient amounts64. More recently, reconstitution of the entire erythromycin pathway in E. coli was attempted; erythromycin A was successfully heterologously pro-duced in E. coli using six plasmids harboring three large PKS genes",

The combined use of an alternative promoter, lowered temperature and coexpression of chaperones led to the production of soluble proteins from all epothilone biosyn-thetic genes and the subsequent production of epothilones C and D at <1 mg/l in a strain of E. coli BAP1 (ref. 74). Similarly, the function-ality of the codon-optimized artificial pathway was demonstrated by the heterologous production of epothilones A and B (~100 mg/l) in M. xanthus75. Although the reconstitution of large PKS or NRPS biosynthetic pathways using synthetic genes has so far only been demonstrated for the epothilones, the achieved low production yields suggest that unknown fundamental constraints might limit the utilization of artificial DNA for the production of certain classes of PK or NRP natural",
        "products.Additionally, there are opportunities to engineer the spatial organization of biosynthetic enzymes. Synthetic scaffolds based on protein, RNA and DNA have been successfully engineered to co-localize proteins and to increase the yield of the biosynthetic path-way by increasing the spatial proximity of biosynthetic enzymes, optimizing their local stoichiometry, and minimizing the loss of intermediates while avoiding accumulation of toxic intermediates (Fig. 5). In particular, a protein scaffold built using the protein-protein interaction domains of signaling proteins to recruit meta-bolic enzymes fused with their specific peptide ligands was used to co-localize and control the stoichiometry of three mevalonate biosynthesis enzymes. Significant (77-fold) increases in mevalonate production were observed by introducing several of these scaf-folds in E. coli76. Alternatively, RNA aptamer\u2013based scaffolds, in which RNA aptamers incorporated into the scaffolds recruited the appropriately tagged enzymes to precise positions on the scaf-fold, have been reported to control the spatial organization of two enzymes involved in hydrogen production, yielding a 48-fold increase in hydrogen production over that of a system without the scaffold77. More recently, DNA scaffolds built by creating chimeras between biosynthetic enzymes and zinc-finger domains that bind DNA sequences in a controlled order were used to moderate titer enhancement (up to five-fold) of resveratrol, 1,2-propanediol and mevalonate in E. coli78. Despite the potential disadvantages of these synthetic scaffold systems, such as the instability of the scaffolds, these examples suggest the potential use of artificial scaffold systems to efficiently co-localize and control the stoichiometry of individual enzymes in non-PKS or NRPS",
        "pathways.Moreover, promising fine-tunable libraries of promoters79 and ribosome binding sites (RBSs)80 can control the relative amounts of individual enzymes at both the transcriptional and translational levels in E. coli. Recently, a synthetic promoter library for actino-mycetes based on the randomization of the \u201310 and \u201335 consensus sequence of the widely used constitutive promoter ermEp 1 from S. erythraea was also constructed, displaying 2\u2013319% of ermEp 1 activity. The strongest synthetic promoter was used to express a type III PKS RppA from of S. erythraea, and an approximately three-fold increase in flaviolin production was observed as compared with that for the ermEp 1* promoter (a strong variant of ermEp 1) in S. lividans (Fig.",
        "5)81.High-throughput genome editing tools, such as the clus-tered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein (CRISPR/Cas) system82, and genomic evolution technology, such as the multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE)83, are now available for the efficient engineering of microbial hosts for heterologous expression and combinatorial biosynthesis via chromosomal deletion, the addi-tion or alteration of the specific sequences or the fine-tuning of expression level of multiple targeted genes (Fig. 6). In the type II CRISPR/Cas system, which provides bacterial immunity against foreign DNA via RNA-guided DNA cleavage, short foreign \u2018spacer\u2019 DNAs are integrated within the CRISPR genomic loci and transcribed into short CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) that anneal to trans-activating crRNAs (tracrRNAs) to direct sequence-specific cleavage of foreign DNA by Cas9 proteins. Recent evi-dence suggests that the Cas9\u2013crRNA\u2013tracrRNA complex can target any protospacer DNA sequence when the requisite NGG protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) is present at the 3\u02b9 end. The spacer sequences matching target genomic loci can be directly programmed into a heterologously expressed CRISPR array, and the crRNA and tracrRNA can be fused to create a chimeric single-guide RNA (sgRNA) for further simplification. The CRISPR/Cas system can be reconstituted in a range of hosts including human cells84, S. cerevisiae85, E. coli86 and different Streptomyces species87, demonstrating the potential for multiplex genome editing (Fig. 6). However, further studies are needed to assess its utility, includ-ing the extent to which off-target effects occur. As an alternative, MAGE is an efficient method for generating targeted diversity on a genome scale to achieve the coordinated expression of individual genes for maximum efficiency of the host system. Single-stranded oligonucleotides can be used to target multiple short DNA for directed evolution through mismatches, insertion and deletion in the E. coli genome. The oligonucleotides can be sequentially trans-formed into the same E. coli population, allowing the targeted modification to accumulate at different chromosome sites. The efficiency of MAGE was demonstrated by the isolation of an E. coli variant with a more than five-fold increase in lycopene production within 3 days (Fig. 6)83. However, because this technology requires an efficient transformation and single-stranded oligonucleotide-mediated allelic replacement, it may not be amenable to wider use in other organisms and has not been adapted for use in actinomy-cetes with a high GC",
        "content.Additionally, antisense RNA (asRNA)-mediated gene silencing is also an effective strategy to engineer the host without genome edit-ing or gene knockouts that can cause host instability or may result in decreased growth rates. This approach has been used in E. coli and also in other bacteria, including S. coelicolor, where antisense RNA silencers successfully inhibited actinorhodin production (Fig. 6)88. In addition, this approach has recently been used with small regu-latory RNAs (sRNAs), short noncoding RNAs in prokaryotes that control target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and can thus be used to control gene expression in E. coli (Fig. 6). Engineered synthetic sRNAs consist of a target-binding sequence complementary to the target mRNA and a scaffold for recruiting the Hfq protein, which helps the hybridization of sRNA to the target mRNA and the subsequent degradation. Using this strategy to com-binatorially knock down candidate genes in different strains, an E. coli strain was isolated that produces 2 g/l of tyrosine89. This method is useful for large-scale target identification and for modulating chromosomal gene expression without modifying these genes, but unfortunately, its applicability to hosts other than E. coli has not yet been",
        "shown.When developed for use in a wider range of chassis, including the most prolific natural product\u2013producing actinomycetes, the synthetic biology tools listed above will facilitate essential combi-natorial biosynthesis studies aimed at broadening the scope of bio-synthetic building blocks and enzymes and developing efficient and robust heterologous expression systems. For instance, the spatial organization and stoichiometry of the enzymes expressed from the codon-optimized synthetic genes can be engineered using synthetic scaffolds in desirable hosts in which their precursor supply, regu-latory networks and other production properties are optimized by CRISPR/Cas, MAGE or sRNA",

        "10.1038/NCHEMBIO.1893biosynthesis of natural products is not truly \u2018combinatorial\u2019. Rather, this process creates small, focused libraries of natural products that can still reduce costs and time associated with drug discovery due to the significantly higher hit rate for natural products and their derivatives4. Combining biosynthesis and synthetic organic chem-istry allows combinatorial biosynthesis to be \u2018more combinatorial\u2019 and provide greater promise in delivering chemical libraries for lead optimization and structure-activity relation studies. Recently, the multiplex combinatorial biosynthesis of a total 380 antimycin derivatives (for example, 10\u201312), of which 356 were new, was real-ized by combining multiple mutasyntheses at different biosynthetic stages with the chemistry needed to provide unnatural precursors and to modify the alkyne-bearing variants via click chemistry20. In another example, the chlorine installed on pacidamycin by the expression of a heterologous halogenase was used as a selective handle for further synthetic diversification to generate four new analogs (36\u201339) (Fig. 4) using mild cross-coupling conditions in crude aqueous extracts of the culture broth90. Although conven-tional chemical methods for structural diversification will remain an indispensable technology, combinatorial biosynthesis reinvigor-ated by synthetic chemistry has now become an efficient alternative approach. Scientists in both fields should cooperate more closely to design useful analogs as well as to generate compounds that are dif-ficult to make by solely chemical",
        "means.Although early success stories focused on PKs and NRPs pri-marily from actinomycete bacteria, combinatorial biosynthesis has since been applied to many classes of natural products, including RIPPs91, saccharides92, terpenoids93 and alkaloids94 from assorted organisms. Because the non-modular biosynthetic machineries for these natural products are more amenable to combinatorial assembly than PKS and NRPS systems, they have huge potential to generate combinatorial biosynthetic libraries. For example, RIPP biosynthetic genes from cyanobacteria including the patellamide95 and cyanobactin pathways96 were functionally expressed in E. coli. In the latter case, rules for the sequence selectivity of a RIPP path-way were determined, suggesting that RIPP pathways are a promis-ing source for combinatorial",
        "engineering.Once we know what to make, the challenge remains how to make it at scale. Despite many successful examples of combinatorial bio-synthesis, the production of many natural products generated by combinatorial biosynthesis suffers from low productivity, ultimately delaying analysis in the lab and clinical testing or commercializa-tion of compounds with improved activity or pharmacokinetics. We posit that improved yields will be realized through the integration of emerging systems and synthetic biology techniques combined with traditional metabolic engineering to optimize chassis strains and expression systems, as exemplified by the industry-scale production of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid in engineered yeast70.",
        "With the increasing scientific understanding and technical capa-bilities gained over the last two decades, we argue that the basic foundation has been laid for the \u2018total biosynthesis\u2019 of designed nat-ural products or small, focused libraries solely through combinato-rial biosynthesis. Further investigations of biosynthetic systems will guide our strategies, synthetic biology will enable the construction of naturally unavailable but efficient biological machinery, and syn-thetic chemistry will allow us to install naturally unavailable chemi-cal functionalities to truly diversify nature\u2019s biosynthetic chemistry. We envision that in the not-too-distant future, the structures of target molecules derived either from unisolable or uncultivable natural sources or by rational design will be able to guide the ret-rosynthetic design of artificial biosynthetic genes using computa-tional tools97 (see p. 639) and allow them to be synthesized in parts. The resulting synthetic DNA can then be assembled into functional biosynthetic pathways and productively expressed in an optimized chassis for the de novo generation of these designed products. The feasibility of this envisioned future is exemplified in the construc-tion of the biosynthetic pathway of the antiviral nucleoside analog 2\u02b9,3\u02b9-dideoxyinosine (didanosine) in a retrograde fashion98. As the production of the final product is the only selection criterion in this \u2018bioretrosynthesis\u2019 approach, assay design and the screening of each biosynthetic step can be reduced. After directed evolution of the final and penultimate enzymes, purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 1,5-phosphopentomutase, respectively, the antepenultimate enzyme ribokinase was engineered unexpectedly to bypass the 1,5-phosphopentomutase step owing to the increased direct phos-phorylation activity of the anomeric hydroxyl group of the starting substrate dideoxyribose.
