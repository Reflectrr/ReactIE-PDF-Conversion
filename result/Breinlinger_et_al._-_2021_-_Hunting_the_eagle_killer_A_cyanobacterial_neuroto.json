Wilde\u2020\u2021 INTRODUCTION: Vacuolar myelinopathy (VM) is a neurological disease characterized by wide-spread vacuolization in the white matter of the brain. First diagnosed in 1994 in bald eagles, it has since spread throughout the southeastern United States. In addition to avian species such as waterfowl and birds of prey, VM has also been found to affect amphibians, reptiles, and fish. Despite intense research efforts, the cause of this mysterious disease has been elusive. Neither contagious agents nor xe-nobiotics were detected in deceased animals, but field and laboratory studies demonstrated that VM can be transferred through the food chain from herbivo-rous fish and wildlife to birds of prey. RATIONALE: Occurrence of VM has been linked to a cyanobacterium(Aetokthonos hydrillicola) growing on an invasive plant (Hydrilla verticillata) in man-made water bodies. Cyanobacte-ria are known to produce potent toxins, sowehypoth-esized that a neurotoxin produced by the epiphytic cyanobacteriumcausesVM. RESULTS: Field studies in the southeastern United States confirmed that H.verticillatawascolonized withA. hydrillicola inmore than half of the water-sheds.Wildlife VM deaths occurred only in reservoirs with denseH. verticillata andA. hydrillicolapopula-tions. Laboratory bioassays confirmed the neurotox-icity of crude extracts of A.hydrillicola\u2013H.verticillata biomass collected during VM outbreaks, but neurotoxicity was not detected in samples from VM-free sites. Laboratory cultures of the cyanobacterium, however, did not elicit VM. A. hydrillicola growing onH. verticillata collected at VM-positive reservoirs was then analyzed bymass spectrometry imaging, which revealed that cyanobacterial colonies were co-localized with a brominated metabolite. Sup-plementation of an A. hydrillicola laboratory culture with potassium bromide resulted in pronounced biosynthesis of this metabolite. H. verticillata hyperaccumulates bromide from the environment, potentially supplying the cyanobacterium with this biosynthesis precursor. Isolation and structure elucida-tion of the metabolite revealed a structurally unusual pentabrominated biindole alkaloid, which we called aetokthonotoxin (AETX). Genome sequencing of A. hydrillicola allowed the identification of the AETX biosynthetic gene cluster. Biochemical characterization of a halogenase detected in the cluster demon-strated that it brominates tryptophanwith the expected substitution pattern. AETX is highly toxic to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [median lethal concentration (LC50) 40 nM] and zebrafish (Danio rerio; LC50 275 nM). Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus) gavaged with AETX developed brain lesions charac-teristic of VM, whereas no lesions were ob-served in control chickens. VM diagnosis in treated chickens was verified using transmis-sion electron microscopy of brain tissue. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that AETX is the causative agent of VM.AETXbiosynthesis relies on the availability of bromide. Seasonal envi-ronmental conditions promoting toxin produc-tion of A. hydrillicola are watershed specific. The consequences of elevated bromide from geologic and anthropogenic sources (e.g., water treatment and power plants) on VM should be further investigated. Notably, integrated chemical plant management plans to control H. verticillata should avoid the use of bromide-containing chemicals (e.g., diquat dibromide). AETX is lipophilic with the potential for bio-accumulation during transfer through food webs, somammalsmay alsobe at risk. Increased monitoring and public awareness should be implemented for A. hydrillicola and AETX to protect both wildlife and human health.\u25aa RESEARCH Breinlinger et al., Science 371, 1335 (2021) 26 March 2021 1 of 1 The list of author affiliations is available in the full article online. *These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2021Corresponding author.

Wilde2\u2020\u2021 Vacuolar myelinopathy is a fatal neurological disease that was initially discovered during a mysterious mass mortality of bald eagles in Arkansas in the United States. The cause of this wildlife disease has eluded scientists for decades while its occurrence has continued to spread throughout freshwater reservoirs in the southeastern United States. Recent studies have demonstrated that vacuolar myelinopathy is induced by consumption of the epiphytic cyanobacterial species Aetokthonos hydrillicola growing on aquatic vegetation, primarily the invasive Hydrilla verticillata. Here, we describe the identification, biosynthetic gene cluster, and biological activity of aetokthonotoxin, a pentabrominated biindole alkaloid that is produced by the cyanobacterium A. hydrillicola. We identify this cyanobacterial neurotoxin as the causal agent of vacuolar myelinopathy and discuss environmental factors\u2014especially bromide availability\u2014that promote toxin production. O ver thewinter of 1994 to 1995, the largest undiagnosed mass mortality of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the United States occurred at DeGray Lake inArkansas (1).More than 70dead eagles were found in the next 2 years. The mysterious mortalities were characterized by a spongiform myelinopathy that had never been documented in wild avian populations (2, 3). Investigators of the Arkansas die-off began to notice eagles and waterbirds with similar neurological impair-ment throughout the southeastern states. By 1998, the emerging disease was termed avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) and had been confirmed at 10 sites in six states (1). AVM has since been documented in numerous avian species across the southeastern United States during the fall and winter, most notably in waterbirds such as American coots (Fulica americana), ringneckedducks (Aythya collaris), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and in various birds of prey (3\u20137). All documented AVM cases were recovered on or near man-made water bodies with abundant aquatic vegetation that senesces during the late fall and winter months (3\u20137). The abundance of fish and avian prey asso-ciated with these aquatic plants attracts over-wintering and nesting bald eagles and other birds of prey (8\u201310). AVM-afflicted wildlife are prone to injury and become easy prey for pred-ators, as clinical signs of the disease include the severe loss of motor functions (movie S1 shows affected American coots) (2, 10). Al-though neurological impairment is a visual in-dication of disease, AVM diagnosis relies on histological confirmation of widespread vacuol-ization of themyelinated axons (intramyelenic edema) in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord (1). Early sentinel field trials documented neu-ropathy and vacuolar lesions in wild coots and mallards within 5 days of release into a lake with an ongoing AVM epizootic (4\u20136). Initial chemical analysis of sediment and dead birds recovered from reservoirs where AVM cases were documented revealed no xenobiotic com-pounds known to induce intramyelenic edema inmammals and birds\u2014e.g., hexachlorophene, triethyltin, or bromethalin (1, 11, 12). Early laboratory feeding trials using plants, water, and sediment collected from disease sites failed to induce the neuropathy and vacuolar lesions seen in wild birds (13, 14). Additionally, no contagious transfer, pathogens inducing myelinopathy, or neuroinflammation were documented in wild or experimental AVM-affected animals (12, 13). These early studies suggested that an unknown, seasonal, and environmental neurotoxin could be respon-sible (14, 15). The search for the elusive source of this disease then focused on environmental con-ditions in AVM-positive water bodies, which revealed that all of them supported invasive submerged aquatic vegetation, primarily Hydrilla verticillata, with a previously uniden-tified epiphytic cyanobacterium\u2014Aetokthonos hydrillicola\u2014colonizing up to 95% of the plant leaves (16\u201318). Field and laboratory studies demonstrated that AVM could be transferred up the food chain. It is induced in herbivorous waterbirds after ingestion ofH. verticillata colonized by A. hydrillicola and in birds of prey that consume the affected waterfowl (9, 16, 19, 20). Not only does AVM present an emerging threat to the Southeast\u2019s avian species (5, 6), but subsequent field and labo-ratory H. verticillata\u2013A. hydrillicola feeding trials have confirmed neuropathy and mortal-ity in a wide variety of taxa, including amphib-ians, reptiles, and fish, as well as secondary disease transfer through the food chain. Thus, the disease is now referred to as vacuolar myelinopathy (VM) (21\u201324). Cyanobacteria have long been associated with the production of toxins and other spe-cialized metabolites (25\u201329). We hypothesized that a neurotoxin produced by the epiphytic cyanobacteriumA. hydrillicola is the causative agent of VM. Here, we present our evidence that VM is caused by a cyanobacterial neuro-toxin with notable structural features. In addi-tion to discovering the neurotoxin, we have identified its biosynthetic gene cluster and present toxicity data on model birds, fish, nematodes, and crustaceans. Finally, we dis-cuss environmental factors that promote toxin production. Results A. hydrillicola distribution Sampling of submerged aquatic vegetation in lakes, reservoirs, and other water bodies throughout the southeastern United States has revealed a complex and widespread pat-tern of A. hydrillicola distribution (16\u201318). As of fall 2019, we documented H. verticillata colonized with A. hydrillicola in 31 of 69 sam-pled watersheds (Fig. 1 and table S1). Water bodies include large (>10,000 ha) hydropower or water-supply reservoirs, countywater-source reservoirs, suburban recreational lakes, and farm ponds. Given the difficulty of document-ing animals dying from VM and the extensive spread of invasive H. verticillata, our current RESEARCH Breinlinger et al., Science 371, eaax9050 (2021) 26 March 2021 1 of 7 1Institute of Pharmacy, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany. 2Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. 3Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Hydrobiology, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Czech Republic. 4Centre Algatech, Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, T\u0159ebo\u0148, Czech Republic. 5Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Czech Republic. 6Office of Research and Development, Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Athens, GA, USA. 7Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Molekulare Pharmakologie (FMP), Berlin, Germany. 8Department of Population Health, Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. 9Department of Cellular Biology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. 10Horticulture Department, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. 11Institute of Chemistry, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany. 12Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology (MPIMM), Bremen, Germany. 13Cyano Biotech GmbH, Berlin, Germany. *These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2021Corresponding author.

D ow nloaded from https://ww w .science.org at University of Illinois -Urbana on June 01, map ofA. hydrillicola distribution is certainly underestimating the prevalence of the cyano-bacterium and its threat to endemic wildlife, fish, and freshwater resources. Discovery and production of the putative toxin In 2011,we collectedH.verticillatawith epiphyt-ic A. hydrillicola from the J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir (in Georgia and South Carolina) to isolate the cyanobacterial strain for mass cul-tivation and subsequent isolation of the puta-tive cyanotoxin. As a result of challenges in establishing culture conditions for this epi-phytic colonizer, it took 2 years to generate sufficient A. hydrillicola biomass for a first feeding trial. The identity of the strain was confirmed as A. hydrillicola by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. However, chickens gavaged with thisA. hydrillicolabiomassdidnot develop VM, which failed to support that A. hydrillicola was producing a VM-inducing toxin. Hypothesizing that the cyanobacterium produces the hypothetical toxin only when growing on H. verticillata, but not in labo-ratory culture, we collected additional samples of A. hydrillicola growing on H. verticillata at confirmed VM sites. The cyanobacterial colonies on the H. verticillata leaves were analyzed by atmospheric-pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationmass spec-trometry imaging (AP-MALDI-MSI) to detect cyanobacteria-specificmetabolites in situ.Using AP-MALDI-MSI, we could colocalize the cyano-bacterial colonies with a metabolite with the sum formula C17H6Br5N3 (Fig. 2, A to D), which was not detectable in laboratory cultures by high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013 mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Neither com-mercial (Dictionary of Natural Products 28.2, SciFinder) nor in-house natural product data-bases revealed an entry for this elemental composition, which suggests that it is a novel natural product. The fact that the metabolite contains five bromine atoms is notable, as polyhalogenated synthetic compounds, such as bromethalin or hexachlorophene, are known to induce VM-like brain lesions in birds and mammals (1, 5, 11, 30). The presence of bromine in the putative toxin presented a potential explanation for why our laboratory cultures of the cyanobacterium did not cause VM. Our standard cultivation medium, BG11, does not contain any bromide, which is critical for the biosynthesis of the toxin. Supplementation of the cultivation me-diumwith potassium bromide resulted in the pronounced biosynthesis of this pentabromin-ated metabolite. We found a nonlinear rela-tion between bromide concentration in the medium and the production of the pentabro-minated metabolite by the cyanobacterium. We determined that the optimum bromide concentration for productivity is between 0.1 and 0.5 mM KBr (fig. S1). Although a minor production can readily be detected by HPLC-MS once the medium is supplementedwith bromide, we observed a substantial increase in production under stress conditions. A drop in temperature (from culti-vation at 28\u00b0C down to 21\u00b0C) or enhanced cul-turemovement (shear stress) triggermetabolite production to an extent (>100-fold) that it be-comes easily detectable byHPLC-UV (ultraviolet, detection at 286 nm) (figs. S2 and S3). Hypothesizing that this pentabrominated metabolite was the putative toxin, we screened A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata assemblages col-lected from lakes during VM outbreaks using HPLC-MS and compared them with biomass from VM-free sites (where H. verticillata was not colonized with A. hydrillicola). We could detect this metabolite only in biomass col-lected fromVM-affected lakes, which strength-ened our hypothesis (fig. S4). Furthermore, the compound could be detected in the tissues of two deceased wild American coots collected during an AVM outbreak at the J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir (Georgia) in November 2014 (fig. S5), which confirmed that the com-pound is absorbed from the gut and accu-mulates in wild waterfowl. Additionally, we observed a seasonal variation of the toxin con-centration in A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata biomass collected from J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir, with the peak concentration de-tected in November (fig. S6). This observation agrees with the finding that VM occurrences have been documented in late autumn in res-ervoirs, coinciding with seasonal water tem-perature declines and lake turnover. As the biosynthesis of the pentabrominated metabolite requires bromide, we investigated bromide availability inA. hydrillicola habitats. Total bromine content in H. verticillata and sediments as well as the bromide concentra-tion in water from VM-positive (containing H. verticillata colonized by A. hydrillicola) and VM-negative (containing only uncolonized H. verticillata) reservoirswasmonitored season-ally. Colonized and uncolonizedH. verticillata leaves contain significantly (P < 0.001) higher concentrations of bromine than sediments (~20-fold) and water (500-to 1000-fold) (fig. S7). In late summer, southeastern U.S. reser-voirs are stratified, with warm, sunlit, and oxygenated water above and cool, dark, and anoxic water trapped below. During late fall, surface water temperatures cool, water layers mix, and H. verticillata senesces. We propose that this seasonal shift provides a bromide-enriched local environment, which ultimately triggers A. hydrillicola\u2019s production of the elusive toxin. Isolation and structure elucidation of aetokthonotoxin (AETX) Cultivation of A. hydrillicola with bromide supplementation as well as field collections of A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata assemblages allowed us to isolate the compound in suffi-cient amounts for structure elucidation and bioactivity characterization. Because of the proton deficiency of the compound, exten-sive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic aswell as high-resolution mass spectrometric analyses were required to elucidate its structure, which was confirmed by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 3, supplementary Breinlinger et al., Science 371, eaax9050 (2021) 26 March 2021 2 of 7 Fig. 1.

The struc-ture has notable chemical features. Most prominent\u2014also evident from the isotope pat-tern observed in mass spectrometry analyses of the compound\u2014are the five bromo sub-stituents. Brominated organic compounds are often found to be produced by marine or-ganisms but are also found in plants, fungi, lichen, bacteria, and even humans (31\u201333). Several bromoindoles have been isolated from natural sources (34). Tyrian purple, one of the first brominated indole alkaloids to have been discovered, is not only the most famous ex-ample, it is also a 2,2\u2032-biindole (35). Many brominated organic compounds exhibit strong bioactivity, ranging from antifungal to antimi-crobial to antioxidant activity (36). Synthetic representatives have lately become infamous as environmental pollutants (37): Because of their lipophilicity, they tend to accumulate in sediment and biota, where they can pose a serious threat to ecosystems (38, 39). Another notable chemical feature of the compound is the connection of the two indole moieties via N1 and C2\u2032; to date, no natural 1,2\u2032-bi-1H-indole has been described. The two indole substruc-tures present in AETX are rare in natural products. The 2,3,5-tribromoindole substruc-ture has only been described from red algae of the genera Laurencia and Nitophyllum (40), the mollusk Aplysia dactylomela (likely be-cause of its red-algal diet) (41), and the cyanobacterium Rivularia firma, which pro-duces numerous structurally related bromin-ated 1,3\u2032-, 3,3\u2032-, and 3,4\u2032-bi-1H-indoles (42). 5,7-Dibromoindole-3-carbonitrile has not yet been found as a natural product substructure. Indole-3-carbonitrile without additional sub-stituents has only been described once as a natural product, isolated from a halophilic bac-teriumprobably belonging to the genusBacillus (43). On the basis of the systematic name of the cyanobacterium, A. hydrillicola (which is Greek for \u201ceagle killer residing onHydrilla\u201d), we called this compound aetokthonotoxin (AETX), or \u201cpoison that kills the eagle\u201d [from the Greek a\u0301et\u03cc\" (\u00e1et\u00f3s), eagle; kte\u03afnw (kte\u00edn\u014d), to kill; and toxik\u03ccn (toxik\u00f3n), toxin]. AETX biosynthesis Because of the specific structure of AETX, which illustrates several chemical features not previously observed in nature, we investigated its biosynthesis. Biosynthetic machineries of most cyanotoxins are organized in compact gene clusters, which can be linked to the re-sulting structures by functional annotation. Thus, we sequenced the whole genomes of two independent A. hydrillicola strains iso-lated from J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir in 2011 (confirmed to produce AETX, as described above) and 2014 and subsequently performed a bioinformatic analysis. Both sequenced ge-nomes contain an identical gene cluster con-sisting of six deduced genes (aetA to aetF), whose annotated functions imply their in-volvement in AETX biosynthesis (Fig. 4A). BLAST searches against all available genomes in the National Center for Biotechnology In-formation (NCBI) database did not show the presence of a similar gene cluster sequenced to date (as of October 2020). The genomic re-gions adjacent to the candidate gene cluster contained other cyanobacterial genes, and the deduced proteins within the cluster had closest relatives in cyanobacteria (table S10), corroborating its cyanobacterial origin. The gene aetE was predicted to encode a tryptophanase (fig. S37 and table S10)\u2014a well-studied enzyme responsible for the conversion of tryptophan to indole (44). This provides a viable hypothesis to explain the origin of the two indole cores in AETX from tryptophan (or a tryptophan-derived intermediate of the pathway). Two genes, aetA and aetF, were predicted to encode NAD(P)/FAD-dependent halogenases related to known halogenases involved in the biosynthesis of cyanobacterial Breinlinger et al., Science 371, eaax9050 (2021) 26 March 2021 3 of 7 Fig. 2.

Besides aetA and aetF from the aet cluster, bioinformatic analysis of the A. hydrillicola genome did not reveal any other homologs to known bacterial tryptophan halogenases organized in a bio-synthesis gene cluster, which further supports their involvement in AETX biosynthesis. The presence of two distinct halogenases could explain the different substitution patterns of the two indole cores of the AETX molecule, which could be achieved by two or more sub-sequent (poly)halogenation reactions. To test this hypothesis and provide initial mechanistic evidence for the role of the aet gene cluster in AETXbiosynthesis, we assessed the activity of the putative halogenase AetF in in vitro experiments. Assays containing recom-binant AetF and L-tryptophan as substrate showed the formation of twobrominatedprod-ucts (Fig. 4, B to E). The high yield of recom-binant AetF from Escherichia coli (fig. S36) allowed us to conduct a larger-scale in vitro assay with yields of both brominated products sufficient for isolation. Subsequent NMR analy-sis of the products unambiguously confirmed that AetF is capable of bromination of tryp-tophan at positions 5 and 7, which exactly matches the substitution pattern observed in one of the AETX indole substructures (figs. S39 to S47). Additional in vitro assays showed that indole is not a substrate of the enzyme, but 5,7-dibromoindole was obtained when 5-bromoindole was provided to AetF (fig. S38). On the basis of these data, we conclude that tryptophan is the primary substrate for AetF, as the enzyme is capable of introducingbromine into unsubstituted tryptophan. The additional AetF bromination activity on 5-bromoindole could result from its steric similarity to 5-bromotryptophan, which we found to be an intermediate of the stepwise bromination of tryptophan. Further in vitro assays with AetA and structural analyses of its products are needed to fully elucidate the chronology of the individual halogenation reactions. The functions of the remaining predicted genes have yet to be experimentally confirmed. Hypothetically, 5-bromotryptophan produced by AetF (or a later, more complex interme-diate) could be used for subsequent additional bromination by AetA to generate the 2,3,5-tribrominated indole substructure. Concerning the possible function of AetB, it is noteworthy that cytochrome P450-like proteins have been previously found to play a crucial role in car-bonitrile formation in natural products (47). Bioactivity characterization of AETX Initial HPLC microfractionation of an A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata assemblage ex-tract revealed that the microfraction contain-ing the pentabrominated compound is toxic to water fleas (Ceriodaphnia dubia), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). This again strengthened our hy-pothesis that this compoundmight be the toxin responsible for causing VM. After preparative isolation of AETX, we determined the lethal dose for 50% of the population (LC50) of the purified compound for C. elegans (40 nM) and larvalD. rerio (275 nM) (fig. S48 and tables S12 to S14). At sublethal concentrations (>10 nM), an inhibitory effect of AETX on reproduction could be observed for C. elegans.

Neurological behaviors observed in zebrafish included twitching, gulping, full-body convulsions, loss of equilibrium, bunch-ing toward the edge of the treatment dishes, rapid pectoral fin movements, and lack of es-cape response when stimulated with a probe. AETX causes VM To test whether AETX was the cause of VM, we used an avian bioassay (3, 9, 15, 19, 21). Spe-cific pathogen-free leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus) were gavagedwith either a suspension of purified AETX (15 mg per kilogram of body weight), AETX containing H. verticillata\u2013 A. hydrillicola extract as positive control (HTX; 4 mg of AETX per kilogram of body weight), or solvent control [10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) indeionizedwater]. All birds appeared normal on physical and neurological exams before the start of the study. During the short duration of the study, chickens did not exhibit pronounced clinical signs of VM in any treat-ment group (four doses over the course of 8 days). However, histological results revealed that chickens in the HTX (N = 3) and purified AETX (N = 3) treatment groups developed extensive vacuolization throughout the white matter of the brainstem, optic tectum, and cerebellum, whereas no lesions were docu-mented in carrier solvent control chickens (N = 2) (Fig. 5A). Transmission electron mi-croscopy of the optic tectum of birds from both the HTX and AETX groups revealed nu-merous vacuoles delimited by myelin laminae that had split at the intraperiod line, confirm-ing the diagnosis of VM (Fig. 5B). Thus, we could confirm that AETX is the causative agent of VM. Conclusions The causative agent of VM has eluded scien-tists for >25 years. Our discovery that VM is in-duced by a pentabrominated biindole alkaloid produced by an epiphytic cyanobacterium expands the role of cyanobacteria as poten-tially dangerous toxin producers. Although harmful blooms of planktonic algae have been shown to extensively alter ecosystems, our find-ingswarrant further research into the potential toxins produced by epiphytic and benthic spe-cies. Our in vitro cultivation experiments show that the biosynthesis of AETX depends on bro-mide availability and that physical stressors (e.g., temperature and agitation) enhance pro-duction. We need to understand the complex environmental factors that affect the distri-bution and toxicity of A. hydrillicola. Further investigation is also needed on bioavailability of bromide from natural (i.e., geologic origin) and anthropogenic sources (e.g., power plants, fungicides, and gasoline additives) and how they influence AETX production. Dense infestations of submerged aquatic plants can bemanaged using chemical, biolog-ical, or physical controls. Notably, herbicides containing bromide as counterions (e.g., diquat dibromide) are currently used to combat the spread of invasive submerged aquatic plants, including H. verticillata. Benefits and risks of using any bromide-containing chemical con-trol agents within VM reservoir watersheds need to be reassessed. Biological controls, espe-cially triploid grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), can remove excess plants, but fishery managers are reluctant to stock these fish for vegetation control because of concerns of overstocking and escape. These triploid sterile grass carp have been effective in eliminating H. verticillata in VM reservoirs with a history of eagle deaths (e.g., DeGray Lake, Arkansas, and J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir, Georgia and South Carolina) (21, 48). Physical control ofH. verticillata is often ineffective because of its ability to reproduce from fragments, tubors, and turions released during mechan-ical harvesting. Site-specific, integrated man-agement solutions have emerged frommore than 50 years of research into invasive-plant control by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-servation Commission, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the University of Florida (49). ControllingH. verticillata inVMreserviorswith toxicA. hydrillicola is critical to protect aquatic species and their consumers, but doing so Breinlinger et al., Science 371, eaax9050 (2021) 26 March 2021 5 of 7 A B C Fig. 5. Light and transmission electron microscopy of brain tissue from chickens exposed to AETX and controls confirm that AETX is causing VM.

Chickens exposed to HTX and AETX treatments had widespread vacuolization of the white matter myelin tracts compared with controls (arrows). (B) Numerous vacuoles delimited by myelin laminae that had split at the intraperiod line (arrows) were observed, confirming the diagnosis of VM in both AETX (shown here) and HTX treatment groups.

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE D ow nloaded from https://ww w .science.org at University of Illinois -Urbana on June 01, presents additional complexity and risks. Fu-ture vegetation management should prioritize overall ecosystem health and affordable, long-term solutions to control and prevent the ex-pansion of H. verticillata and A. hydrillicola. Wildlife are exposed to AETX in their envi-ronment for a substantially longer time period compared with the animals in our short-term bioassays. Raptors breeding on VM reservoirs and juveniles returning to their natal terri-tories extend the disease risk over generations. Considering the lipophilicity of AETX and the demonstration of trophic transfer, there is po-tential for bioaccumulation. The confirmation that additional herbivorous aquatic taxa in VM food webs are susceptible to AETX (i.e., birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates) also increases the potential risk to their con-sumers. Because we do not yet fully under-stand how A. hydrillicola and its neurotoxin affect the complex aquatic ecosytems, increased monitoring and public awareness should be implemented for A. hydrillicola and AETX. A toxin produced by cyanobacteria that colonize a highly invasive plant, which has the capacity to affect diverse animal phyla, should not be underestimated in its potential impact on our environment. Analyticalmethodsdescribed should facilitate expandedmonitoring of AETX in aquatic environments and animal tissues. Moreover, there remains a critical need for research on mammalian susceptibility to VM and on human health risks from the consump-tion of fish and waterbirds from VM reservoirs. Materials and methods summary H. verticillata samples collected fromnumerous watersheds from 2014 to 2020 were screened for the presence of A. hydrillicola. After iso-lation of A. hydrillicola from environmental samples and adaptation to laboratory condi-tions, the cyanobacterium was cultivated in BG11 medium with or without the addition of potassium bromide. H. verticillata leaves colonized with A. hydrillicola were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy as well as AP-MALDI-MSI (9-AA as matrix in negative-ionization mode; lateral resolution, 10 mm). Environmental bromide and bromine concen-trations inH. verticillata, sediment, andwater samples were analyzed by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and ion chromatography. The structure of AETX was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography after isolation of the compound using flash chromatography, semi-preparative HPLC, and recrystallization. The genome of A. hydrillicolawas amplified from single filaments using multiple displacement amplification and then sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The putative AETX biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by BLASTp searches for bacterial halogenases against the A. hydrillicola genome. The halo-genase AetF was heterologously expressed in E. coli and then purified. Biochemical assays to characterize its activity used tryptophans and indoles as substrates. Reaction products were structurally characterized by HPLC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata extract fractions and pure AETX were tested for activity on C. dubia, D. rerio, C. elegans, andG. gallus. Bioassays onD. rerio and G. gallus were performed in accordance with the National Insitutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and followed protocol A2017 11-007-Y1-A0, which was reviewed, approved, and overseen by the University of Georgia Institutional Ani-mal Care and Use Committee. VM occurrence in treated birds was confirmed by analysis of the white matter of their optic lobe using light microscopy and transmission electron micros-copy. Tissues of deceased wild birds were ex-tracted and analyzed for AETX by HPLC-MS. A full description of thematerials andmethods used in this study is provided in the supple-mentary materials.

        "INTRODUCTION: Vacuolar myelinopathy (VM) is a neurological disease characterized by wide-spread vacuolization in the white matter of the brain. First diagnosed in 1994 in bald eagles, it has since spread throughout the southeastern United States. In addition to avian species such as waterfowl and birds of prey, VM has also been found to affect amphibians, reptiles, and fish. Despite intense research efforts, the cause of this mysterious disease has been elusive. Neither contagious agents nor xe-nobiotics were detected in deceased animals, but field and laboratory studies demonstrated that VM can be transferred through the food chain from herbivo-rous fish and wildlife to birds of prey.",
        "RATIONALE: Occurrence of VM has been linked to a cyanobacterium(Aetokthonos hydrillicola) growing on an invasive plant (Hydrilla verticillata) in man-made water bodies. Cyanobacte-ria are known to produce potent toxins, sowehypoth-esized that a neurotoxin produced by the epiphytic cyanobacteriumcausesVM.",
        "RESULTS: Field studies in the southeastern United States confirmed that H.verticillatawascolonized withA. hydrillicola inmore than half of the water-sheds.Wildlife VM deaths occurred only in reservoirs with denseH. verticillata andA. hydrillicolapopula-tions. Laboratory bioassays confirmed the neurotox-icity of crude extracts of A.hydrillicola\u2013H.verticillata",
        "biomass collected during VM outbreaks, but neurotoxicity was not detected in samples from VM-free sites. Laboratory cultures of the cyanobacterium, however, did not elicit VM. A. hydrillicola growing onH. verticillata collected at VM-positive reservoirs was then analyzed bymass spectrometry imaging, which revealed that cyanobacterial colonies were co-localized with a brominated metabolite. Sup-",
        "plementation of an A. hydrillicola laboratory culture with potassium bromide resulted in pronounced biosynthesis of this metabolite. H. verticillata hyperaccumulates bromide from the environment, potentially supplying the cyanobacterium with this biosynthesis precursor. Isolation and structure elucida-tion of the metabolite revealed a structurally unusual pentabrominated biindole alkaloid, which we called aetokthonotoxin (AETX). Genome sequencing of A. hydrillicola allowed the identification of the AETX biosynthetic gene cluster. Biochemical characterization of a halogenase detected in the cluster demon-strated that it brominates tryptophanwith the expected substitution pattern. AETX is highly toxic to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [median lethal concentration (LC50) 40 nM] and zebrafish (Danio rerio; LC50 275 nM). Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus) gavaged with AETX developed brain lesions charac-teristic of VM, whereas no lesions were ob-served in control chickens. VM diagnosis in treated chickens was verified using transmis-sion electron microscopy of brain tissue.",
        "CONCLUSION: We confirmed that AETX is the causative agent of VM.AETXbiosynthesis relies on the availability of bromide. Seasonal envi-ronmental conditions promoting toxin produc-tion of A. hydrillicola are watershed specific. The consequences of elevated bromide from geologic and anthropogenic sources (e.g., water treatment and power plants) on VM should be further investigated. Notably, integrated chemical plant management plans to control H. verticillata should avoid the use of bromide-containing chemicals (e.g., diquat dibromide). AETX is lipophilic with the potential for bio-accumulation during transfer through food webs, somammalsmay alsobe at risk. Increased monitoring and public awareness should be implemented for A. hydrillicola and AETX to protect both wildlife and human health.\u25aa",

        "Vacuolar myelinopathy is a fatal neurological disease that was initially discovered during a mysterious mass mortality of bald eagles in Arkansas in the United States. The cause of this wildlife disease has eluded scientists for decades while its occurrence has continued to spread throughout freshwater reservoirs in the southeastern United States. Recent studies have demonstrated that vacuolar myelinopathy is induced by consumption of the epiphytic cyanobacterial species Aetokthonos hydrillicola growing on aquatic vegetation, primarily the invasive Hydrilla verticillata. Here, we describe the identification, biosynthetic gene cluster, and biological activity of aetokthonotoxin, a pentabrominated biindole alkaloid that is produced by the cyanobacterium A. hydrillicola. We identify this cyanobacterial neurotoxin as the causal agent of vacuolar myelinopathy and discuss environmental factors\u2014especially bromide availability\u2014that promote toxin production.",
        "O",
        "ver thewinter of 1994 to 1995, the largest undiagnosed mass mortality of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the United States occurred at DeGray Lake inArkansas (1).More than 70dead eagles",
        "were found in the next 2 years. The mysterious mortalities were characterized by a spongiform myelinopathy that had never been documented in wild avian populations (2, 3). Investigators of the Arkansas die-off began to notice eagles and waterbirds with similar neurological impair-ment throughout the southeastern states. By 1998, the emerging disease was termed avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) and had been confirmed at 10 sites in six states (1). AVM",
        "has since been documented in numerous avian species across the southeastern United States during the fall and winter, most notably in waterbirds such as American coots (Fulica americana), ringneckedducks (Aythya collaris), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and in various birds of prey (3\u20137). All documented AVM cases were recovered on or near man-made water bodies with abundant aquatic vegetation that senesces during the late fall and winter months (3\u20137). The abundance of fish and avian prey asso-ciated with these aquatic plants attracts over-wintering and nesting bald eagles and other birds of prey (8\u201310). AVM-afflicted wildlife are prone to injury and become easy prey for pred-ators, as clinical signs of the disease include the severe loss of motor functions (movie S1 shows affected American coots) (2, 10). Al-though neurological impairment is a visual in-dication of disease, AVM diagnosis relies on histological confirmation of widespread vacuol-ization of themyelinated axons (intramyelenic edema) in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord (1). Early sentinel field trials documented neu-ropathy and vacuolar lesions in wild coots and mallards within 5 days of release into a lake with an ongoing AVM epizootic (4\u20136). Initial chemical analysis of sediment and dead birds recovered from reservoirs where AVM cases were documented revealed no xenobiotic com-pounds known to induce intramyelenic edema inmammals and birds\u2014e.g., hexachlorophene, triethyltin, or bromethalin (1, 11, 12). Early laboratory feeding trials using plants, water, and sediment collected from disease sites",
        "failed to induce the neuropathy and vacuolar lesions seen in wild birds (13, 14). Additionally, no contagious transfer, pathogens inducing myelinopathy, or neuroinflammation were documented in wild or experimental AVM-affected animals (12, 13). These early studies suggested that an unknown, seasonal, and environmental neurotoxin could be respon-sible (14, 15).",
        "The search for the elusive source of this disease then focused on environmental con-ditions in AVM-positive water bodies, which revealed that all of them supported invasive submerged aquatic vegetation, primarily Hydrilla verticillata, with a previously uniden-tified epiphytic cyanobacterium\u2014Aetokthonos hydrillicola\u2014colonizing up to 95% of the plant leaves (16\u201318). Field and laboratory studies demonstrated that AVM could be transferred up the food chain. It is induced in herbivorous waterbirds after ingestion ofH. verticillata colonized by A. hydrillicola and in birds of prey that consume the affected waterfowl (9, 16, 19, 20). Not only does AVM present an emerging threat to the Southeast\u2019s avian species (5, 6), but subsequent field and labo-ratory H. verticillata\u2013A. hydrillicola feeding trials have confirmed neuropathy and mortal-ity in a wide variety of taxa, including amphib-ians, reptiles, and fish, as well as secondary disease transfer through the food chain. Thus, the disease is now referred to as vacuolar myelinopathy (VM) (21\u201324).",
        "Cyanobacteria have long been associated with the production of toxins and other spe-cialized metabolites (25\u201329). We hypothesized that a neurotoxin produced by the epiphytic cyanobacteriumA. hydrillicola is the causative agent of VM. Here, we present our evidence that VM is caused by a cyanobacterial neuro-toxin with notable structural features. In addi-tion to discovering the neurotoxin, we have identified its biosynthetic gene cluster and present toxicity data on model birds, fish, nematodes, and crustaceans. Finally, we dis-cuss environmental factors that promote toxin production. Results A. hydrillicola distribution Sampling of submerged aquatic vegetation in lakes, reservoirs, and other water bodies throughout the southeastern United States has revealed a complex and widespread pat-tern of A. hydrillicola distribution (16\u201318). As of fall 2019, we documented H. verticillata colonized with A. hydrillicola in 31 of 69 sam-pled watersheds (Fig. 1 and table S1). Water bodies include large (>10,000 ha) hydropower or water-supply reservoirs, countywater-source reservoirs, suburban recreational lakes, and farm ponds.

        "map ofA. hydrillicola distribution is certainly underestimating the prevalence of the cyano-bacterium and its threat to endemic wildlife, fish, and freshwater resources. Discovery and production of the putative toxin In 2011,we collectedH.verticillatawith epiphyt-ic A. hydrillicola from the J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir (in Georgia and South Carolina) to isolate the cyanobacterial strain for mass cul-tivation and subsequent isolation of the puta-tive cyanotoxin. As a result of challenges in establishing culture conditions for this epi-phytic colonizer, it took 2 years to generate sufficient A. hydrillicola biomass for a first feeding trial. The identity of the strain was confirmed as A. hydrillicola by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. However, chickens gavaged with thisA. hydrillicolabiomassdidnot develop VM, which failed to support that A. hydrillicola was producing a VM-inducing toxin.",
        "Hypothesizing that the cyanobacterium produces the hypothetical toxin only when growing on H. verticillata, but not in labo-ratory culture, we collected additional samples of A. hydrillicola growing on H. verticillata at confirmed VM sites. The cyanobacterial colonies on the H. verticillata leaves were analyzed by atmospheric-pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationmass spec-trometry imaging (AP-MALDI-MSI) to detect cyanobacteria-specificmetabolites in situ.Using AP-MALDI-MSI, we could colocalize the cyano-bacterial colonies with a metabolite with the sum formula C17H6Br5N3 (Fig. 2, A to D), which was not detectable in laboratory cultures by high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013",
        "mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Neither com-mercial (Dictionary of Natural Products 28.2, SciFinder) nor in-house natural product data-bases revealed an entry for this elemental composition, which suggests that it is a novel natural product. The fact that the metabolite contains five bromine atoms is notable, as polyhalogenated synthetic compounds, such as bromethalin or hexachlorophene, are known to induce VM-like brain lesions in birds and mammals (1, 5, 11, 30). The presence of bromine in the putative toxin presented a potential explanation for why our laboratory cultures of the cyanobacterium did not cause VM. Our standard cultivation medium, BG11, does not contain any bromide, which is critical for the biosynthesis of the toxin. Supplementation of the cultivation me-diumwith potassium bromide resulted in the pronounced biosynthesis of this pentabromin-ated metabolite. We found a nonlinear rela-tion between bromide concentration in the medium and the production of the pentabro-minated metabolite by the cyanobacterium. We determined that the optimum bromide concentration for productivity is between 0.1 and 0.5 mM KBr (fig. S1). Although a minor production can readily be detected by HPLC-MS once the medium is supplementedwith bromide, we observed a substantial increase in production under stress conditions. A drop in temperature (from culti-vation at 28\u00b0C down to 21\u00b0C) or enhanced cul-turemovement (shear stress) triggermetabolite production to an extent (>100-fold) that it be-comes easily detectable byHPLC-UV (ultraviolet, detection at 286 nm) (figs. S2 and S3).",
        "Hypothesizing that this pentabrominated metabolite was the putative toxin, we screened A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata assemblages col-lected from lakes during VM outbreaks using HPLC-MS and compared them with biomass from VM-free sites (where H. verticillata was not colonized with A. hydrillicola). We could detect this metabolite only in biomass col-lected fromVM-affected lakes, which strength-ened our hypothesis (fig. S4). Furthermore, the compound could be detected in the tissues of two deceased wild American coots collected during an AVM outbreak at the J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir (Georgia) in November 2014 (fig. S5), which confirmed that the com-pound is absorbed from the gut and accu-mulates in wild waterfowl. Additionally, we observed a seasonal variation of the toxin con-centration in A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata biomass collected from J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir, with the peak concentration de-tected in November (fig. S6). This observation agrees with the finding that VM occurrences have been documented in late autumn in res-ervoirs, coinciding with seasonal water tem-perature declines and lake turnover.",
        "As the biosynthesis of the pentabrominated metabolite requires bromide, we investigated bromide availability inA. hydrillicola habitats. Total bromine content in H. verticillata and sediments as well as the bromide concentra-tion in water from VM-positive (containing H. verticillata colonized by A. hydrillicola) and VM-negative (containing only uncolonized H. verticillata) reservoirswasmonitored season-ally. Colonized and uncolonizedH. verticillata leaves contain significantly (P < 0.001) higher concentrations of bromine than sediments (~20-fold) and water (500-to 1000-fold) (fig. S7). In late summer, southeastern U.S. reser-voirs are stratified, with warm, sunlit, and oxygenated water above and cool, dark, and anoxic water trapped below. During late fall, surface water temperatures cool, water layers mix, and H. verticillata senesces. We propose that this seasonal shift provides a bromide-enriched local environment, which ultimately triggers A. hydrillicola\u2019s production of the elusive toxin. Isolation and structure elucidation of aetokthonotoxin (AETX) Cultivation of A. hydrillicola with bromide supplementation as well as field collections of A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata assemblages allowed us to isolate the compound in suffi-cient amounts for structure elucidation and bioactivity characterization. Because of the proton deficiency of the compound, exten-sive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic aswell as high-resolution mass spectrometric analyses were required to elucidate its structure, which was confirmed by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 3, supplementary",

Synthetic representatives have lately become infamous as environmental pollutants (37): Because of their lipophilicity, they tend to accumulate in sediment and biota, where they can pose a serious threat to ecosystems (38, 39). Another notable chemical feature of the compound is the connection of the two indole moieties via",
        "N1 and C2\u2032; to date, no natural 1,2\u2032-bi-1H-indole has been described. The two indole substruc-tures present in AETX are rare in natural products. The 2,3,5-tribromoindole substruc-ture has only been described from red algae of the genera Laurencia and Nitophyllum (40), the mollusk Aplysia dactylomela (likely be-cause of its red-algal diet) (41), and the cyanobacterium Rivularia firma, which pro-duces numerous structurally related bromin-ated 1,3\u2032-, 3,3\u2032-, and 3,4\u2032-bi-1H-indoles (42). 5,7-Dibromoindole-3-carbonitrile has not yet been found as a natural product substructure. Indole-3-carbonitrile without additional sub-stituents has only been described once as a natural product, isolated from a halophilic bac-teriumprobably belonging to the genusBacillus (43). On the basis of the systematic name of the cyanobacterium, A. hydrillicola (which is Greek for \u201ceagle killer residing onHydrilla\u201d), we called this compound aetokthonotoxin (AETX), or \u201cpoison that kills the eagle\u201d [from the Greek a\u0301et\u03cc\" (\u00e1et\u00f3s), eagle; kte\u03afnw (kte\u00edn\u014d), to kill; and toxik\u03ccn (toxik\u00f3n), toxin]. AETX biosynthesis Because of the specific structure of AETX, which illustrates several chemical features not previously observed in nature, we investigated its biosynthesis. Biosynthetic machineries of most cyanotoxins are organized in compact gene clusters, which can be linked to the re-sulting structures by functional annotation. Thus, we sequenced the whole genomes of two independent A. hydrillicola strains iso-lated from J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir in 2011 (confirmed to produce AETX, as described above) and 2014 and subsequently performed a bioinformatic analysis. Both sequenced ge-nomes contain an identical gene cluster con-sisting of six deduced genes (aetA to aetF), whose annotated functions imply their in-volvement in AETX biosynthesis (Fig. 4A). BLAST searches against all available genomes in the National Center for Biotechnology In-formation (NCBI) database did not show the presence of a similar gene cluster sequenced to date (as of October 2020). The genomic re-gions adjacent to the candidate gene cluster contained other cyanobacterial genes, and the deduced proteins within the cluster had closest relatives in cyanobacteria (table S10), corroborating its cyanobacterial origin.",
        "The gene aetE was predicted to encode a tryptophanase (fig. S37 and table S10)\u2014a well-studied enzyme responsible for the conversion of tryptophan to indole (44). This provides a viable hypothesis to explain the origin of the two indole cores in AETX from tryptophan (or a tryptophan-derived intermediate of the pathway).

        "which could be achieved by two or more sub-sequent (poly)halogenation reactions.",
        "To test this hypothesis and provide initial mechanistic evidence for the role of the aet gene cluster in AETXbiosynthesis, we assessed the activity of the putative halogenase AetF in in vitro experiments. Assays containing recom-binant AetF and L-tryptophan as substrate showed the formation of twobrominatedprod-ucts (Fig. 4, B to E). The high yield of recom-binant AetF from Escherichia coli (fig. S36) allowed us to conduct a larger-scale in vitro assay with yields of both brominated products sufficient for isolation. Subsequent NMR analy-sis of the products unambiguously confirmed that AetF is capable of bromination of tryp-tophan at positions 5 and 7, which exactly matches the substitution pattern observed in one of the AETX indole substructures (figs. S39 to S47). Additional in vitro assays showed that indole is not a substrate of the enzyme, but 5,7-dibromoindole was obtained when 5-bromoindole was provided to AetF (fig. S38). On the basis of these data, we conclude that tryptophan is the primary substrate for AetF, as the enzyme is capable of introducingbromine into unsubstituted tryptophan. The additional AetF bromination activity on 5-bromoindole could result from its steric similarity to 5-bromotryptophan, which we found to be an intermediate of the stepwise bromination of tryptophan. Further in vitro assays with AetA and structural analyses of its products are needed to fully elucidate the chronology of the individual halogenation reactions. The functions of the remaining predicted genes have yet to be experimentally confirmed. Hypothetically, 5-bromotryptophan produced by AetF (or a later, more complex interme-diate) could be used for subsequent additional bromination by AetA to generate the 2,3,5-tribrominated indole substructure. Concerning the possible function of AetB, it is noteworthy that cytochrome P450-like proteins have been previously found to play a crucial role in car-bonitrile formation in natural products (47). Bioactivity characterization of AETX Initial HPLC microfractionation of an A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata assemblage ex-tract revealed that the microfraction contain-ing the pentabrominated compound is toxic to water fleas (Ceriodaphnia dubia), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). This again strengthened our hy-pothesis that this compoundmight be the toxin responsible for causing VM. After preparative isolation of AETX, we determined the lethal dose for 50% of the population (LC50) of the purified compound for C. elegans (40 nM) and larvalD. rerio (275 nM) (fig. S48 and tables S12 to S14). At sublethal concentrations (>10 nM), an inhibitory effect of AETX on reproduction could be observed for C. elegans. Exposure to",

        "purified AETX induced neurological seizure\u2013 like behavior in larval zebrafish (movie S2), consistentwith behavior seenwhen larvawere exposed to AETX containing H. verticillata\u2013 A. hydrillicola biomass extract that had been confirmed to cause VM lesions in the chicken bioassay. Neurological behaviors observed in zebrafish included twitching, gulping, full-body convulsions, loss of equilibrium, bunch-ing toward the edge of the treatment dishes, rapid pectoral fin movements, and lack of es-cape response when stimulated with a probe. AETX causes VM To test whether AETX was the cause of VM, we used an avian bioassay (3, 9, 15, 19, 21). Spe-cific pathogen-free leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus) were gavagedwith either a suspension of purified AETX (15 mg per kilogram of body weight), AETX containing H. verticillata\u2013 A. hydrillicola extract as positive control (HTX; 4 mg of AETX per kilogram of body weight), or solvent control [10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) indeionizedwater]. All birds appeared normal on physical and neurological exams before the start of the study. During the short duration of the study, chickens did not exhibit pronounced clinical signs of VM in any treat-ment group (four doses over the course of 8 days). However, histological results revealed that chickens in the HTX (N = 3) and purified AETX (N = 3) treatment groups developed extensive vacuolization throughout the white matter of the brainstem, optic tectum, and cerebellum, whereas no lesions were docu-mented in carrier solvent control chickens (N = 2) (Fig. 5A). Transmission electron mi-croscopy of the optic tectum of birds from both the HTX and AETX groups revealed nu-merous vacuoles delimited by myelin laminae that had split at the intraperiod line, confirm-ing the diagnosis of VM (Fig. 5B). Thus, we could confirm that AETX is the causative agent of VM. Conclusions The causative agent of VM has eluded scien-tists for >25 years. Our discovery that VM is in-duced by a pentabrominated biindole alkaloid produced by an epiphytic cyanobacterium expands the role of cyanobacteria as poten-tially dangerous toxin producers. Although harmful blooms of planktonic algae have been shown to extensively alter ecosystems, our find-ingswarrant further research into the potential toxins produced by epiphytic and benthic spe-cies. Our in vitro cultivation experiments show that the biosynthesis of AETX depends on bro-mide availability and that physical stressors (e.g., temperature and agitation) enhance pro-duction. We need to understand the complex environmental factors that affect the distri-bution and toxicity of A. hydrillicola. Further investigation is also needed on bioavailability",

Dense infestations of submerged aquatic plants can bemanaged using chemical, biolog-ical, or physical controls. Notably, herbicides containing bromide as counterions (e.g., diquat dibromide) are currently used to combat the spread of invasive submerged aquatic plants, including H. verticillata. Benefits and risks of using any bromide-containing chemical con-trol agents within VM reservoir watersheds need to be reassessed.

        "Wildlife are exposed to AETX in their envi-ronment for a substantially longer time period compared with the animals in our short-term bioassays. Raptors breeding on VM reservoirs and juveniles returning to their natal terri-tories extend the disease risk over generations. Considering the lipophilicity of AETX and the demonstration of trophic transfer, there is po-tential for bioaccumulation. The confirmation that additional herbivorous aquatic taxa in VM food webs are susceptible to AETX (i.e., birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates) also increases the potential risk to their con-sumers. Because we do not yet fully under-stand how A. hydrillicola and its neurotoxin affect the complex aquatic ecosytems, increased monitoring and public awareness should be implemented for A. hydrillicola and AETX. A toxin produced by cyanobacteria that colonize a highly invasive plant, which has the capacity to affect diverse animal phyla, should not be underestimated in its potential impact on our environment. Analyticalmethodsdescribed should facilitate expandedmonitoring of AETX in aquatic environments and animal tissues. Moreover, there remains a critical need for research on mammalian susceptibility to VM and on human health risks from the consump-tion of fish and waterbirds from VM reservoirs. Materials and methods summary H. verticillata samples collected fromnumerous watersheds from 2014 to 2020 were screened for the presence of A. hydrillicola. After iso-lation of A. hydrillicola from environmental samples and adaptation to laboratory condi-tions, the cyanobacterium was cultivated in BG11 medium with or without the addition of potassium bromide. H. verticillata leaves colonized with A. hydrillicola were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy as well as AP-MALDI-MSI (9-AA as matrix in negative-ionization mode; lateral resolution, 10 mm). Environmental bromide and bromine concen-trations inH. verticillata, sediment, andwater samples were analyzed by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and ion chromatography. The structure of AETX was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography after isolation of the compound using flash chromatography, semi-preparative HPLC, and recrystallization.

Bald eagle mass death events in the southeastern United States may be one such downstream effectof human activity. After considerable effort, Breinlinger et al. identified the cause of these events as an insidiouscombination of factors. Colonization of waterways by an invasive, introduced plant provided a substrate for the growthof a previously unidentified cyanobacterium. Exposure of this cyanobacterium to bromide, typically anthropogenic inorigin, resulted in the production of a neurotoxin that both causes neuropathy in animals that prey on the plants andalso bioaccumulates to kill predators such as bald eagles.Science, this issue p.",
