Despite numerous reports of FAD-dependent halogenases uti-lizing CP-tethered substrates, only a few have been biochemically characterized due to limited accessibility to the physiological substrates. Here, we describe a method for the preparation of acyl-S-CP substrates and their use in biochemical assays to query the activity of FAD-dependent halogenases. Furthermore, we describe a mass spectrometry-based method for the characterization of acyl-S-CP substrates and the corresponding halogenated products generated by the halogenases.

The methodology described here will enable characterization of new halogenases employing CP-tethered substrates. 1. INTRODUCTION Halogenation is a modification that is routinely afforded upon natural products and often confers unique biological activities to these organic molecules, including, but not limited to desirable pharmaceutical anti-biotic and cytotoxic activities. Bioactivities of small molecules can be crit-ically dependent on halogenation, such as for the antibiotics vancomycin (1, Fig. 1) and chloramphenicol (2). Four principal classes of halogenating enzymes have been described to date, their mechanisms, and activities tai-lored to halogenate diverse substrates varying from electron-rich aromatic rings to unactivated alkyl centers (Agarwal et al., 2017). Of the four classes, this manuscript describes procedures to assay the activity of halogenases that employ flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor. FAD-dependent halogenases oxidize halides (XNone, X\u00bcCl, Br, and I) to their corresponding halenium (X+) ions that are regiospecifically delivered either as a haloamines or as hypohalites to electron-rich centers to catalyze electrophilic substitu-tion reactions (Flecks et al., 2008; Yeh, Blasiak, Koglin, Drennan, &Walsh, 2007). FAD-dependent halogenases require a partner enzyme, flavin Fig. 1 Chemical structures of halogenated antibiotics 1 and 2, biosynthesis of which involves FAD-dependent halogenases that employ CP-tethered substrates. 334 Hem R. Thapa et al. reductase, to deliver reduced FAD (FADH2) that is required for halogenase activity. Electrons to generate FADH2 from FAD are derived from NAD(P)H. Molecular oxygen acts as the final sink for these electrons, together with the electrons derived from the oxidation of the halide. The catalytic scheme for FAD-dependent halogenases is shown in Fig. 2. The inventory of halogenated natural products involving the participa-tion of FAD-dependent halogenases in their respective biosynthetic schemes is already impressive and continues to expand. Furthermore, char-acterization of their biochemical activities has advanced FAD-dependent halogenases to a stage where they can be successfully used as diagnostic ele-ments to identify natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in genomic and metagenomics datasets (Agarwal, Blanton, et al., 2017; Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017; Jordan & Moore, 2016). Enzymatic functionalization of carbon centers by halogenation has attracted attention toward the engi-neering of FAD-dependent halogenases to improve their thermal and solvent tolerance, to expand their substrate scope, and to use these enzymes in a combinatorial fashion to engineer natural product scaffolds (Brown & O\u2019Connor, 2015; Latham, Brandenburger, Shepherd, Menon, & Micklefield, 2018; Menon et al., 2017; Payne, Andorfer, & Lewis, 2016; Fig. 2 Catalytic mechanism for FAD-dependent halogenases. In this study, the Escherichia coli flavin reductase SsuE is used to deliver FADH2 to the halogenases while the phosphite dehydrogenase PtdH is used to regenerate NADPH (see Section 4.1 for experimental details). The identity of the electrophilic halogenating species generated by FAD-dependent halogenases, hypohalite ([XOH]), or a haloamine generated by the capture of the halenium by the side chain amine of a conserved Lys residue in the halogenase active site is presently not clear. 335Chemoenzymatic Synthesis Schnepel, Minges, Frese, & Sewald, 2016). The efforts alluded to above are principally directed toward FAD-dependent halogenases that use small-molecule organic substrates, such as L-Trp.Much of our current mechanistic understanding for FAD-dependent halogenases relies on the crystal struc-tures of and biochemical studies performed using L-Trp chlorinases (Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017). In contrast, the pace of characterization of FAD-dependent halogenases that employ substrates tethered to carrier proteins (CPs) has been sluggish. For instance, despite the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and establishment of aryl-halogenation as being critical to antibiotic efficacy, reconstitution of the bioactivity of the FAD-dependent halogenase VhaA participating in the biosynthesis of 1 has only recently been achieved (Pinchman & Boger, 2013a, 2013b; Schmartz, Zerbe, Abou-Hadeed, & Robinson, 2014; van Wageningen et al., 1998). As a second example, while the biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified and the crystal structure of the enzyme determined, a firm biochemical characterization of the FAD-dependent halogenase CmlS involved in the biosynthesis of 2 is still elusive (He, Magarvey, Piraee, & Vining, 2001; Podzelinska et al., 2010). Two challenges precipitate this knowledge gap. First, the timing of haloge-nation relative to other biochemical modifications in multimodular schemes involving CP-tethered substrates can be hard to decipher. Second, synthesis of CP-tethered substrates in itself can be challenging as is described in detail later. CPs are small proteins with a conserved four-helical bundle structure. The side chain hydroxyl of a conserved serine residue in apo-CPs is post-translationally esterified to a phosphopantetheine \u201carm\u201d derived from coenzyme A (CoA-SH), a transformation afforded by phosphopantetheinyl transferases to yield holo-CPs (Fig. 3) (Beld, Sonnenschein, Vickery, Noel, & Burkart, 2014). Following esterification with phosphopantetheine, the terminal thiol of holo-CPs is condensed with adenylated carboxylic acids in an ATP-dependent ligation reaction to yield acyl-S-CPs. Acyl-S-CPs serve to carry carboxylic acids through reaction schemes while the carbox-ylic acid is activated by the formation of the high-energy thioester bondwith the phosphopantetheine arm. Following modifications of the acyl moiety, the thioester bond can be displaced by various nucleophiles, by water to yield carboxylic acids, by alcohols to yield esters and lactones, by amines to yield amides and lactams, by carbanions to yield Claisen condensation products, or transthioesterified. These modifications are extensively repre-sented in primary metabolism and in natural product biosynthetic pathways. 336 Hem R. Thapa et al. CPs, when expressed as recombinant proteins in heterologous hosts such as Escherichia coli, are posttranslationally modified in situ to their corresponding holo forms by phosphopantetheinyl transferases that are pre-sent in the heterologous host\u2019s proteome. However, these conversions usu-ally do not reach completion and heterologously expressed CPs are purified as a mixture of apo and holo states. The discovery and characterization of the broadly substrate tolerant phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp has provided a straightforward, and now widely employed, route for the conversion of apo-CPs to holo-CPs (Quadri et al., 1998). However, the conversion of holo-CPs to acyl-S-CPs can be complicated by the nonavailability of an appropriate ligase, specifically when the carboxylic acid to be ligated to the holo-CP is an advanced biosynthetic intermediate for which a cognate ligase does not exist. Strategies to address this challenge have been devised. Numerous biosyn-thetic enzymes that employ acyl-S-CoA and acyl-S-CP substrates have been reported to use abbreviated substrates, such asN-acetylcysteamine thioesters (NAC thioesters, Fig. 3). Strategies for the elaboration of NAC thioesters were recently reviewed (Franke & Hertweck, 2016). An alternate strategy is based on the substrate tolerance of Sfp. The crystal structure of Sfp in com-plex with CoA-SH reveals that the enzyme makes extensive contacts with Fig. 3 Posttranslational maturation of apo-CP by transfer of the phosphopantetheine arm from CoA-SH to the side chain hydroxyl of a conserved serine residue to yield holo-CP, followed by formation of the thioester bond with a carboxylic acid to generate acyl-S-CPs. In some cases, acyl-S-CP substrates can be substituted by abbreviated NAC thioesters. An alternate route to generating acyl-S-CPs relies on the transfer of the acyl-S-phosphopantetheine from acyl-S-CoAs, chemically synthesized by the ligation of CoA-SH with carboxylic acids, by the phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp. The E. coli CP (PDB: 4ETW) is shown in cartoon representation as a representative example of the ter-tiary structure of CPs and the site for the conserved Ser residue (Agarwal, Lin, Lukk, Nair, & Cronan, 2012). 337Chemoenzymatic Synthesis the 30-phosphoadenosine and the pyrophosphate moieties of CoA-SH. However, the cysteamine moiety is not actively engaged by the enzyme (Reuter, Mofid, Marahiel, & Ficner, 1999). Thus, Sfp can directly catalyze the production of acyl-S-CPs starting from apo-CPs by the transfer of the acyl-S-phosphopantetheine moiety from acyl-S-CoAs (Fig. 3). This strategy requires the elaboration of acyl-S-CoAs by the synthetic ligation of carboxylic acids to CoA-SH, a reaction that proceeds in low yields while using typically high-priced CoA-SH as a substrate, and requires a chromatographic purification of the acyl-S-CoA product (Mishra & Drueckhammer, 2000). Hence, alternate routes for the elaboration of acyl-S-CoAs have been sought (Peter, Vogeli, Cortina, & Erb, 2016). By adopting the substrate promiscuity of the CoA-SH biosynthetic enzymes together with the broad substrate tolerance of Sfp, we have recently reported a chemoenzymatic scheme for the elaboration of acyl-S-CoAs and acyl-S-CPs at a multimilligram scale (Agarwal et al., 2015; Nazi, Koteva, &Wright, 2004; Strauss & Begley, 2002). These procedures are out-lined in Section 3 together with mass spectrometric assays to query the acyl-ation states of CPs. In Section 4, we describe procedures to assay for the activity of FAD-dependent halogenases using acyl-S-CP substrates together with themass spectrometric characterization of the assay products. Using these procedures, for the first time, we experimentally validate the distinction between physiological chlorinases and brominases. 2. EQUIPMENTS AND CONSUMABLES Equipments 1.

PREPARATION OF Acyl-S-CPs 3.1 Discussion The biosynthesis of the halogenated pyrrole containing marine natural products pentabromopseudilin (3, Fig. 4), marinopyrrole A (4), and chlo-rizidine (5) each involves halogenation of a pyrrolyl-S-CP intermediate by the FAD-dependent halogenases Bmp2, Mpy16, and Clz5, respectively (Agarwal et al., 2014; Mantovani & Moore, 2013; Yamanaka, Ryan, Gulder, Hughes, & Moore, 2012). As described above, ligases that append pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid to the corresponding holo-S-CPs (Bmp1, Mpy15, and Clz18, respectively) do not exist, since pyrrolyl-S-CPs are advanced biosynthetic intermediates that are derived by the enzymatic oxidation of prolyl-S-CPs (Fig. 4) (Agarwal et al., 2014; Thomas, Burkart, & Walsh, 2002; Walsh, Garneau-Tsodikova, & Howard-Jones, 2006). It should be noted that the synthesis and halogenation of pyrrolyl-S-CPs are not restricted to marine natural products. The discovery of gene clusters encoding produc-tion of 3\u20135was inspired by the prior characterization of themolecular logic for the construction of the dichlorinated pyrrole moiety in the terrestrial natural product pyoluteorin (6) (Dorrestein, Yeh, Garneau-Tsodikova, Kelleher, & Walsh, 2005; Thomas et al., 2002). 339Chemoenzymatic Synthesis As ATP-dependent ligases that ligate pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid to holo-CPs are not available, alternate strategies have been employed for the synthesis of pyrrolyl-S-CP substrates in order to assay the activities of the FAD-dependent halogenases as illustrated in Fig. 4. In a strategy that mimics the natural product biosynthetic scheme, ATP-dependent ligases are used to ligate L-Pro to holo-CPs to generate prolyl-S-CPs, followed by oxidation of the prolyl heterocycle to the aromatic pyrrolyl ring by FAD-dependent dehydrogenases (Dorrestein et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2002). This approach is complicated by the FAD-dependent dehydrogenase being difficult to purify, and which does not yield stoichiometric conversion of the prolyl-S-CP substrate to the pyrrolyl-S-CP product (Agarwal et al., 2014; Dorrestein et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2002). Based on the prior dem-onstration of the broad substrate tolerance for the coenzyme A biosynthetic enzymes CoaA, CoaD, and CoaE, and the phosphopantetheinyl transferase Fig. 4 Molecular logic for the construction of halogenated pyrrole moiety in 3\u20136. The phosphopantetheine arm of holo-CPs is abbreviated for clarity. 340 Hem R. Thapa et al. Sfp, we have described a chemoenzymatic scheme to generate pyrrolyl-S-CPs, the procedures for which are described here (Agarwal et al., 2015; El Gamal et al., 2016; Nazi et al., 2004; Quadri et al., 1998; Strauss & Begley, 2002; Worthington & Burkart, 2006). The strategy described affords multimilligram quantities of highly pure pyrrolyl-S-CPs and does not employ the FAD-dependent prolyl-S-CP dehydrogenases. The chemoenzymatic scheme, as illustrated in Fig. 5 involves pyrrolyl-S-pantetheine (7), the synthesis of which has been described in detail previously (Agarwal et al., 2015). 3.2 Procedure Buffers and solvents TB media prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s directions and sterile autoclaved prior to use.

Reduce the incubation temperature to 18\u00b0C and induce protein expression by the addition of 0.3mM IPTG (isopropyl-\u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside). Grow for additional 18hwith vigorous shaking at 18\u00b0C. 5. Collect biomass by centrifugation at 5000None g for 15min at 4\u00b0C. Resuspend the pellet in 50mL resuspension buffer that is prechilled to 4\u00b0C. 6. Lyse bacterial cells by sonication. Care should be exercised to maintain the temperature close to 4\u00b0C during sonication. 7. Clarify the lysate by centrifugation at 30,000None g for 1h at 4\u00b0C. Collect the supernatant. The pellet can be discarded. 8. Apply the supernatant to a 5mL His-Trap chromatography column using an AKTA Prime FPLC system operating at 4\u00b0C. 9. After the supernatant has been applied to the column, wash the column extensively with wash buffer. 10. Elute the bound protein by a continuous linear gradient to 100% elu-tion buffer across 20 column volumes and collect the eluate in 5mL fractions. Analyze the fractions by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. Note: Elute SsuE using elution buffer (#2). Collect fractions with pure SsuE protein and proceed directly to step 18. Do not con-centrate the SsuE protein as it is prone to aggregation. 11. Analyze the fractions by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. 12. Pool the fractions with pure protein and dialyze the protein sample overnight using dialysis buffer. 13. Apply the dialyzed protein sample to a 5mL Hi-Trap Q chroma-tography column using an AKTA Prime FPLC system operating at 4\u00b0C. 14. Wash the column with two column volumes of 95% ion-exchange buffer A and 5% ion-exchange buffer B. 15. Elute the bound protein by a continuous linear gradient to 100% ion-exchange buffer B across 20 column volumes and collect the eluate in 5mL fractions. 16. Analyze the fractions by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. 17. Pool the fractions with pure protein and concentrate to 2.5mL final volume using centrifugal filters with 10kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO). For CPs, use centrifugal filters with 3kDa MWCO. 18. Desalt the concentrated protein into storage buffer using gravity flow desalting columns. 344 Hem R. Thapa et al. 19. For halogenases, record an absorbance spectra from 300 to 600nm. The absorbance spectra should demonstrate the presence of FAD. Typical absorbance spectra for Bmp2 halogenase are shown in Fig. 6. 20. Measure protein concentration using Bradford assay. Store purified proteins at None80\u00b0C in 100\u03bcL aliquots. Store SsuE protein at 4\u00b0C and use without further modifications. Note: Procedures described here typically yield greater than 30mg of purified CPs and greater than 50mg of all other proteins. SsuE protein, as purified above, retains activity for None2 days at 4\u00b0C. A fresh purification of SsuE is rec-ommended after that. 3.2.3 Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Pyrrolyl-S-CPs The scheme for the synthesis of pyrrolyl-S-CPs is illustrated in Fig. 5. Briefly, the four catalysts\u2014CoaA, CoaD, CoaE, and Sfp\u2014are incubated together with the substrates 7, ATP/Mg2+, and purified apo-CPs as listed in Table 2. The reaction is conducted in a \u201csingle-pot\u201d without the require-ment of purifying the intermediates. After incubation at 30\u00b0C, the reaction is purified by size exclusion chromatography and the pyrrolyl-S-CP is col-lected. Size exclusion chromatography removes the residual ATP and other Fig. 6 UV\u2013vis absorbance spectra for Bmp2 demonstrating the presence of FAD cofactor. 345Chemoenzymatic Synthesis small-molecule products generated during the course of the reaction and yields pure pyrrolyl-S-CP in a defined buffer. At this stage, the pyrrolyl-S-CPs can be concentrated and stored at None80\u00b0C in small aliquots for use in halogenation assays described below. As shown in Fig. 5, this procedure generates pyrrolyl-S-CoA in situ which then acts as a substrate for the Sfp enzyme for transfer of the pyrrolyl-S-phosphopantetheine moiety to the side chain hydroxyl of the apo-CP. As Sfp requires the CP to be in the apo state for the transfer of the pyrrolyl-S-phosphopantetheine moiety, holo-CPs are not responsive to this methodology. The procedure illustrated in Fig. 5 is fundamentally different from the biosynthetic scheme as shown in Fig. 4 in which a prolyl ligase is used to ligate L-pro to the phos-phopantetheine thiol of a holo-CP and the prolyl side chain is subsequently oxidized to generate pyrrolyl-S-CP. Experimental protocol 1. Thaw aliquots of apo-CPs (Bmp1 andMpy15), Sfp, PtdH,CoaA,CoaD, and CoaE on ice. Centrifuge briefly using a table-top centrifuge. 2. Prepare a fresh aliquot of 200mM ATP in prechilled 50mM HEPES-Na (pH 7.9) buffer. 3. For each CP, in duplicate, add the reaction components to the final concentrations delineated in Table 2. The reactions should be set up Table 2 Final Concentration of Assay Components for Synthesis of Pyrrolyl-S-CPs Component Concentration in Assay apo-CP 250\u03bcM 7 1mM CoaAa 1\u03bcM CoaDa 1\u03bcM CoaEa 1\u03bcM Sfpa 1\u03bcM ATP 9mM MgCl2 10mM HEPES-Na (pH 7.9) 50mM Water aCoaA, CoaD, CoaE, and Sfp can be premixed as a single \u201cenzyme cocktail\u201d if multiple assays are being set up in parallel. 346 Hem R. Thapa et al. in duplicate, with one of the reactions serving as the negative control (see below). 4. Incubate the reaction at 30\u00b0C for 5min. 5. Initiate one of the two reactions by adding ATP. Adjust the final reac-tion volume to 2.5mL with water. 6. For the other reaction, add water in place of ATP. This reaction is henceforth referred to as \u201cnegative control.\u201d 7. Incubate the reactions at 30\u00b0C for 3h. 8. Centrifuge the reaction tubes at 4\u00b0C to remove any aggregated proteins. 9. Inject the reactions on a Superdex 75 16/200 size exclusion chroma-tography column equilibrated in 20mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0) using an AKTA Prime FPLC system operating at 4\u00b0C. Monitor the absorbance of the eluate at 280nm. 10. For reactions in which ATP is added, two major peaks will be observed on the absorbance chromatogram. The first peak corresponds to the modified CPs, and the second peak corresponds to the residual ATP, and ADP and 30,50-AMP that are generated during the course of the reaction. The second peak is not observed for the negative control reaction. 11. Collect the eluate corresponding the first peak of the absorbance chro-matogram.

Acquire mass spectrometry data between 5 and 40min in the positive ionization mode in the range of 100\u20132000m/z. Perform an external calibration with ESI-L Low Concentration Tuning Mix (Agilent Technologies) prior to data collection and use internal calibrant hexakis (1H,1H,3H\u2013tetrafluoropropoxy)phosphazene (SynQuest Laboratories) throughout the runs.

Thapa et al. 3.3 Data Analysis The acylation states of CPs can be differentiated based on the mass observed in the MS1 mass spectra as well as characteristic phosphopantetheine and acyl-S-phosphopantetheine ejection ions that is observed in theMS2 spectra for holo-and acyl-S-CPs, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 8 (Dorrestein et al., 2006; Dorrestein & Kelleher, 2006). Under positive ionization mode, mining for the masses of these ejection ions in the MS2 spectra allow for deconvolution of the acylation states of the CPs which can be further cor-roborated by calculating the difference in theMS1 masses as illustrated below for apo-Bmp1 and pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 (Figs. 9 and 10). As mentioned previ-ously, expression of CPs in heterologous hosts, E. coli in this study, will lead to partial conversion of apo-CPs to holo-CPs, which will also be deco-nvoluted as described below. Data analysis protocol 1. Generate MS2 extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for [M+H]1+ \u00bc261.13 and [M+H]1+\u00bc354.15 corresponding to the phos-phopantetheine and pyrrolyl-S-phosphopantetheine ejection ions, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8. The EICs for the reactions with and without ATP as described in Section 3.2.3 for Bmp1 are shown in Fig. 9. 2. Using the retention times of the MS2 ejection ions shown in Fig. 9, determine the retention time of MS1 spectra corresponding to holo-and pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 and generate their corresponding MS1 spectra.

Similarly, acyl-S-CPs, such as pyrrolyl-S-CPs, also gen-erate the corresponding ejection ions that can be used to identify acyl-S-CPs in mass spectrometry datasets. Apo-CPs do not generate these characteristic ejection ions. The theoretical parent mass difference between the apo-CPs, holo-CPs, and pyrrolyl-S-CPs is shown. TheseMS1 spectra are shown in Fig. 10. TheMS1 spectra corresponding to the apo state has to be identified empirically. 3. Deconvolute the mass of the apo-, holo-, and pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 using the formula: Deconvoluted mass\u00bc (monoisotopic mass None z) None (z None mass of H+). Thus: For [M+13H]13+ species for apo-Bmp1 as shown in Fig. 10, the calcu-lateddeconvolutedmass is\u00bc (817.35 None 13) None (13 None 1.01)\u00bc10,612.42Da For [M+13H]13+ species for holo-Bmp1 as shown in Fig. 10, the calculated deconvoluted mass is\u00bc (843.50 None 13) None (13 None 1.01)\u00bc 10,952.37Da For [M+13H]13+ species for pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 as shown in Fig. 10, the calculated deconvoluted mass is\u00bc (850.66 None 13) None (13 None 1.01)\u00bc 11,045.45Da. 4. Mass difference between holo-Bmp1 and apo-Bmp1 (10,952.37\u2013 10,612.42\u00bc339.95Da) and between pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 and holo-Bmp1 (11,045.45\u201310,952.37\u00bc93.08Da) is in good agreement with the theoretical mass differences as shown in Fig. 8. Note: It is not necessary that identical [M+nH]n+ species be used for parent mass deconvolution across all MS1 spectra as shown in Fig. 10. Clusters of ions corresponding to different charge states should be manually examined, and the charge state that offers the best resolution between the isotopic peaks should be selected for parent mass deconvolution. Different charge states should lead to identical, or closely matching parent ion masses (depending on the resolution of the mass spectrometer, see below). The resolution of the isotopic peaks will decrease as the charge state increases. However, the Fig. 9 EICs for Bmp1 reactions with and without ATP as described in Section 3.2.3. The MS2 pyrrolyl-S-phosphopantetheine ejection ion (354.15Da) is observed only when ATP is present in the reaction. However the phosphopantetheine ejection ion (261.13Da), which corresponds to the holo-Bmp1 is observed in both reactions. As mentioned before, during recombinant expression in heterologous hosts, apo-CPs are partially converted to their holo state by the activity of the host encoded phosphopantetheinyl transferase(s). 351Chemoenzymatic Synthesis intensity of lower charge states might be too low for the monoisotopic peak to be identified accurately. This tradeoff between resolution and abundance must be empirically balanced for each MS1 spectra. For relatively high res-olution mass spectrometers, such as the Bruker Impact II Q-ToF (resolution None40,000) and the Agilent 6530 Q-ToF (resolution None20,000), the isotopic resolution is usually sufficient that monoisotopic peaks can be accurately identified even for low abundance charge states. For lower resolution mass Fig. 10 MS1 spectra and zoomed in view of the [M+13H]13+ cluster of ions for apo-Bmp1 (top), holo-Bmp1 (middle), and pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 (bottom). In the MS1 spectra, mul-tiple charge states for peptides are typically observed. Charge states decrease toward the right of the spectra. The charge state for a particular cluster of ions can be calculated by counting the number of isotopic peaks that have to be traversed for generating a difference of 1Da starting from the monoisotopic peak. 352 Hem R. Thapa et al. spectrometers, such as the Bruker amaZon SL ion-trap (resolution None2000), only higher abundance charge states can be used to accurately deconvolute parent ion peptide masses. In our experience, ToF and ion-trap instruments both yield identical ejection ions for acyl-S-CP species. As has been reported previously, attention must be paid to fragmentation energies that are employed to generate the MS2 spectra (Agarwal et al., 2015). At low fragmentation energies, ejection ions will not be observed in sufficient abundance to generate MS2 EICs. At high fragmentation energies, acyl-S-pantetheine ejection ions can degrade to pantetheine ejection ions due to cleavage of the labile thioester bond. The appropriate fragmentation energy must also be empirically determined. 4. HALOGENATION OF Acyl-S-CPs 4.1 Discussion FAD-dependent halogenases acting on substrates tethered to CPs are mech-anistically identical to FAD-dependent halogenases acting on small-molecule substrates such as L-tryptophan (Fig. 2). Halogenases acting on CP-tethered substrates routinely catalyze multiple halogenations on their CP-tethered aromatic substrates. For instance, the halogenase Bmp2 brominates all four carbon atoms of a pyrrole ring while Mpy16, Clz5, and PltA dichlorinate the pyrrole ring (Dorrestein et al., 2005; El Gamal et al., 2016; Mantovani & Moore, 2013) (Fig. 4). Note, while Bmp2 tetrabrominates the pyrrole ring, a tetrabrominated product will not be pro-duced with the absence of a partner thioesterase enzyme (El Gamal et al., 2016). In the absence of the thioesterase, a tribrominated product, as shown in Fig. 4, will predominate. The halogenase HrmQ, involved in the biosyn-thesis of hormaomycin, only monochlorinates the pyrrole ring (Hofer et al., 2011). Similarly, the FAD-dependent halogenase AltN likely mono-and dibrominates the phenyl ring en route production of the alterochromides (Ross, Gulland, Dorrestein, & Moore, 2015), while the chlorinase SgcC3 only monochlorinates the phenyl ring during the biosynthesis of the enediyne C-1027 (Lin, Van Lanen, & Shen, 2007). FAD-halogenases that work on small organic molecules exclusively catalyze monohalogenations in a regiospecific fashion which is perhaps a result of the highly ordered binding of the substrate in the halogenase active site (Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017; Bitto et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2009). While a crystal structure of FAD-dependent halogenase with a CP-tethered sub-strate is not available yet, the active sites of Bmp2, Mpy16, and PltA seem 353Chemoenzymatic Synthesis to be more accommodating of substrates of different steric sizes (El Gamal et al., 2016; Pang, Garneau-Tsodikova, & Tsodikov, 2015). Recent discov-ery of the bifunctional methyltransferase-halogenase AoiQ and the MalA/ MalA\u2019 indole halogenases, together with the fungal halogenase CazI, how-ever challenge this notion and is likely to further expand the mechanistic repertoire of FAD-dependent halogenases (Chankhamjon et al., 2016; Fraley et al., 2017; Sato et al., 2016). In this section, we focus on the description of the unique activities of FAD-dependent halogenases that affect multiple halogenations on their aro-matic substrates. We describe the procedures to assay for the activity of the pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 tribrominase Bmp2 and the pyrrolyl-S-dichlorinase Mpy16. FAD-dependent halogenases require a partner flavin reductase that provides FADH2 to the halogenase (Fig. 2). We employ the E. coli flavin reductase SsuE for this purpose (Eichhorn, van der Ploeg, & Leisinger, 1999). Electrons required for the reduction of FAD by SsuE are derived from NADPH. In the assay described below, NADPH is regenerated by the thermostable phosphite dehydrogenase PtdH in situ (Fig. 2) (Johannes et al., 2007). Using these procedures, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, that physiological chlorinases as defined by Drennan and coworkers can chlorinate as well as brominate (Blasiak & Drennan, 2009). However, the brominase Bmp2 can only brominate and is incapable of chlorination activity, thus providing a firm experimentally validated dis-tinction between physiological chlorinases and brominases. 4.2 Procedure The purification of halogenases followed the protein purification protocol described in Section 3.2.2, and synthesis of pyrrolyl-S-CP substrates is described in Section 3. Experimental protocol 1. Thaw aliquots of halogenases, pyrrolyl-S-CPs, and PtdH on ice. Cen-trifuge briefly using a table-top centrifuge. 2.

In our expe-rience, pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 and pyrrolyl-S-Mpy15 do not undergo degra-dation during long-term storage at None80\u00b0C. 3. For halogenation of pyrrolyl-S-Mpy15 by Mpy16, keep the chloride concentration in the assay constant at 100mM and vary the concentra-tion of bromide as 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200mM. Add assays components 354 Hem R. Thapa et al. according to Table 4 to a final volume of 100\u03bcL. In case of halogenation of pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 by Bmp2, keep the bromide concentration in the assay constant at 100mM and vary the concentration of chloride as 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200mM. Add assays components according to Table 5 to a final volume of 100\u03bcL. 4. Incubate the reactions at 30\u00b0C for 3h. 5.

The data analysis procedures for the halogenation of pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 by Bmp2 are identical. 1. Generate MS2 EICs, as described in Section 3.3, for [M+H]1+\u00bc388.11 and [M+H]1+\u00bc422.07 corresponding to the monochloropyrrolyl-S-phosphopantetheine and dichloropyrrolyl-S-phosphopantetheine ejec-tion ions, respectively. These EICs correspond to the monochlorinated and dichlorinated products generated by Mpy16 using pyrrolyl-S-Mpy15 as substrate (Fig. 11). As Mpy16 can also accept bromide in Table 5 Concentration of Assay Components for Halogenation of Pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 by Bmp2 Component Concentration in Assay Pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 50\u03bcM Bmp2 20\u03bcM TCEP 5mM Na-phosphite 10mM FAD 20\u03bcM NADP+ 1mM PtdH 10\u03bcM SsuE 50nM KBr 100mM KCl 0, 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200mM HEPES-Na (pH 7.9) 20mM 10% glycerol 356 Hem R.

The different peptide charge states in the MS1 spectra and the ejection ions in the MS2 spectra are illustrated. 358 Hem R. Thapa et al. to the mixed monochlorinated\u2013monobrominated and dibromintaed products generated by Mpy16 (Fig. 11). 2. Using the retention times of the four MS2 ejection ions illu-strated in Fig. 11, determine the MS1 spectra corresponding to monochlorinated-, dichlorinated-, mixed monochlorinated\u2013mono-brominated-, and dibromintaed-pyrrolyl-S-Mpy15. The MS1 spectra for the four possible products generated by Mpy16, along with the MS2 spectra showing the corresponding ejection ions are illustrated in Fig. 12. 3. Using the procedures described in Section 3.3, select an appropriate ion-ization state of the acyl-S-Mpy15 peptide to deconvolute the parent masses. The thus-calculated mass differences should be in good agree-ment with the theoretical mass differences as calculated in Fig. 11. 4. To determine the halide specificity of Mpy16, extract MS2 EICs for all reactions listed in Table 4 for the following ejection ions: [M+H]1+\u00bc422.07, [M+H]1+\u00bc466.02, and [M+H]1+\u00bc509.97. As illustrated in Fig. 11 (blue boxes), these MS2 ions correspond, respec-tively, to the dichlorinated, dibrominated, and mixed mono-brominated\u2013monochlorinated products that can possibly be generated by Mpy16. 5. Similarly, to determine the halide specificity of Bmp2, extract MS2 EICs for all reactions listed in Table 5 for the following ejection ions: [M+H]1+ \u00bc587.88, [M+H]1+\u00bc456.03, and [M+H]1+\u00bc543.93. As illustrated in Fig. 11 (red boxes), these MS2 ions correspond, respectively, to the tribrominated, trichlorinated, and mixed dibrominated\u2013mono-chlorinated products that can hypothetically be generated by Bmp2. Note: It has been demonstrated that Mpy16 specifically catalyzes dihalogenation of the pyrrole ring, while in the absence of the thioesterase, Bmp2 catalyzes trihalogenation of the pyrrole ring (El Gamal et al., 2016). 6. The thus-generated EICs for all reactions listed in Table 4 are plotted in Fig. 13A, and EICs for all reactions listed in Table 5 are plotted in Fig. 13B. Note: For the halogenation of pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 by Bmp2, under no relative concentration of chloride and bromide in the assay can a chlorinated product be observed (Fig. 13B). A different trend is observed for Mpy16. At high relative concentration of chloride in the assay, Mpy16 generates a predominantly dichlorinated product (Fig. 13A). However, as the relative 359Chemoenzymatic Synthesis Fig. 13 MS2 EICs (A) for all reactions listed in Table 4 for ejection ions corresponding to the dichlorinated, dibrominated, and mixed monobrominated\u2013monochlorinated products that can possibly be generated by Mpy16. (B) MS2 EICs for all reactions listed in Table 5 for ejection ions corresponding to trichlorinated, tribrominated, and mixed dibrominated\u2013monochlorinated products that can hypothetically be generated by Bmp2. concentration of bromide in the assay increases, ejection ion corresponding to a mixed brominated\u2013chlorinated product is observed. At high relative concentration of bromide in the assay, the chlorinating activity of Mpy16 is completely abolished and only the ejection ion corresponding to dibrominated product is observed. Hence, the activity of a chlorinase is fun-damentally different from a brominase, in that, a chlorinase (such as Mpy16) is an effective brominating catalyst depending on the relative concentration of halides in the assay. However, a brominase (such as Bmp2) is specific for incorporating bromide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exper-imental demonstration of the halide specificity for a chlorinase and a brominase and is alignedwith the theoretical distinction between chlorinases and brominases (Blasiak & Drennan, 2009). 5. CONCLUSIONS Access to starting material in sufficient quantity and purity is a major obstacle to investigating the reactions catalyzed by halogenase that require CP-tethered substrates. Crystal structures of halogenases in complex with their small-molecule organic substrates and products, such as for the Trp halogenases, have been critical in advancing our mechanistic understanding of FAD-dependent halogenases and their engineering for novel applications (Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017; Latham et al., 2018). However, a cocrystal structure of a FAD-dependent halogenase in complex with a CP-tethered substrate has so far been elusive. In addition to the halogenase, cocrystallization requires access to large quantities of highly pure substrates, and the lack of the above-mentioned crystal structure is perhaps reflective of lack of access to these substrates needed to drive these efforts forward. The procedures describe in this study will enable these efforts in the future. Mechanistically, FAD-dependent halogenases that employ CP-tethered substrates are presumed to be identical to FAD-dependent halogenases that employ small-molecule substrates such as L-Trp. The structural engagement of the FAD cofactor and the positioning of key catalytic resides for the two subclasses of FAD-dependent halogenases is highly similar. However, some key biochemical differences remain to be addressed. Primary among these is the absence of a catalytic Glu reside in acyl-S-CP halogenases (Fig. 14). To facilitate a electrophilic aromatic substitution by the halenium, the side chain of this Glu residue is postulated to serve as the catalytic base to abstract a proton from the substrate molecule, a role that is supported by kinetic and structural studies (Dong et al., 2005; Flecks et al., 2008). Thus, the 361Chemoenzymatic Synthesis identity of the analogous catalytic base is still elusive for acyl-S-CP halogenases. Addressing these mechanistic questions will undoubtedly be aided by availability of a cocrystal structure of a FAD-dependent halogenase in complex with its cognate acyl-S-CP substrate. While this study specifi-cally deals with FAD-dependent halogenases, these procedures described herein can be extended to other classes of halogenases as well. Most perti-nently, numerous \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent nonheme Fe(II) (NHFe) halogenases have been described in literature that require substrates that are tethered to CPs (Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017). However, the activities of several of these enzymes have not been reconstituted in vitro, perhaps due to lack of access to CP-tethered substrates. Owing to high abundance of halides in seawater, the marine environ-ment is an exceptionally rich source of halogenated natural products, specif-ically, of brominated natural products that are exclusively identified from marine sources (Blunt, Copp, Keyzers, Munro, & Prinsep, 2017). The existence of brominated natural products implies that brominases, such as Bmp2, have devised a \u201cmolecular filter\u201d that rejects chloride being used as a substrate by the enzyme. This filter is extraordinarily selective given the None600-fold higher concentration of chloride in seawater as compared to bromide. The chlorinases such as Mpy16, on the other hand, do not exert a similar halide selectivity filter. Chlorinases are equally adept at incorporat-ing chloride and bromide. Hence, it is likely that the presence of chlorinated natural products in the marine environment, as by extension in the terrestrial environment as well, is a consequence of greater abundance and availability of chloride as compared to bromide. Fig. 14 Comparison of active sites of (A) L-Trp chlorinase PrnA (Dong et al., 2005) and (B) pyrrolyl-S-Mpy15 chlorinase Mpy16 (El Gamal et al., 2016). While the cofactor FAD and the catalytic Lys side chain are positioned analogously for the two structures, Mpy16, like other acyl-S-CP halogenases, is missing the key Glu residue which is rep-laced by a Ser. PrnA is complexed with a ClNone anion and the product, 7-chlorotryptophan. 362 Hem R. Thapa et al.

        "Flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent halogenases are widespread in natural product biosynthetic gene clusters and have been demonstrated to employ small organic molecules as substrates for halogenation, as well as substrates that are tethered to carrier proteins (CPs). Despite numerous reports of FAD-dependent halogenases uti-lizing CP-tethered substrates, only a few have been biochemically characterized due to limited accessibility to the physiological substrates. Here, we describe a method for the preparation of acyl-S-CP substrates and their use in biochemical assays to query the activity of FAD-dependent halogenases. Furthermore, we describe a mass spectrometry-based method for the characterization of acyl-S-CP substrates and the corresponding halogenated products generated by the halogenases. Finally, we test",

        "1. INTRODUCTION Halogenation is a modification that is routinely afforded upon natural",
        "products and often confers unique biological activities to these organic molecules, including, but not limited to desirable pharmaceutical anti-biotic and cytotoxic activities. Bioactivities of small molecules can be crit-ically dependent on halogenation, such as for the antibiotics vancomycin (1, Fig. 1) and chloramphenicol (2). Four principal classes of halogenating enzymes have been described to date, their mechanisms, and activities tai-lored to halogenate diverse substrates varying from electron-rich aromatic rings to unactivated alkyl centers (Agarwal et al., 2017). Of the four classes, this manuscript describes procedures to assay the activity of halogenases that employ flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor. FAD-dependent halogenases oxidize halides (XNone, X\u00bcCl, Br, and I) to their corresponding halenium (X+) ions that are regiospecifically delivered either as a haloamines or as hypohalites to electron-rich centers to catalyze electrophilic substitu-tion reactions (Flecks et al., 2008; Yeh, Blasiak, Koglin, Drennan, &Walsh, 2007). FAD-dependent halogenases require a partner enzyme, flavin",

        "reductase, to deliver reduced FAD (FADH2) that is required for halogenase activity. Electrons to generate FADH2 from FAD are derived from NAD(P)H. Molecular oxygen acts as the final sink for these electrons, together with the electrons derived from the oxidation of the halide. The catalytic scheme for FAD-dependent halogenases is shown in Fig. 2.",
        "The inventory of halogenated natural products involving the participa-tion of FAD-dependent halogenases in their respective biosynthetic schemes is already impressive and continues to expand. Furthermore, char-acterization of their biochemical activities has advanced FAD-dependent halogenases to a stage where they can be successfully used as diagnostic ele-ments to identify natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in genomic and metagenomics datasets (Agarwal, Blanton, et al., 2017; Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017; Jordan & Moore, 2016). Enzymatic functionalization of carbon centers by halogenation has attracted attention toward the engi-neering of FAD-dependent halogenases to improve their thermal and solvent tolerance, to expand their substrate scope, and to use these enzymes in a combinatorial fashion to engineer natural product scaffolds (Brown & O\u2019Connor, 2015; Latham, Brandenburger, Shepherd, Menon, & Micklefield, 2018; Menon et al., 2017; Payne, Andorfer, & Lewis, 2016;",
        "Fig. 2 Catalytic mechanism for FAD-dependent halogenases. In this study, the Escherichia coli flavin reductase SsuE is used to deliver FADH2 to the halogenases while the phosphite dehydrogenase PtdH is used to regenerate NADPH (see Section 4.1 for experimental details). The identity of the electrophilic halogenating species generated by FAD-dependent halogenases, hypohalite ([XOH]), or a haloamine generated by the capture of the halenium by the side chain amine of a conserved Lys residue in the halogenase active site is presently not clear.",
        "335Chemoenzymatic Synthesis",
        "Schnepel, Minges, Frese, & Sewald, 2016). The efforts alluded to above are principally directed toward FAD-dependent halogenases that use small-molecule organic substrates, such as L-Trp.Much of our current mechanistic understanding for FAD-dependent halogenases relies on the crystal struc-tures of and biochemical studies performed using L-Trp chlorinases (Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017). In contrast, the pace of characterization of FAD-dependent halogenases that employ substrates tethered to carrier proteins (CPs) has been sluggish. For instance, despite the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and establishment of aryl-halogenation as being critical to antibiotic efficacy, reconstitution of the bioactivity of the FAD-dependent halogenase VhaA participating in the biosynthesis of 1 has only recently been achieved (Pinchman & Boger, 2013a, 2013b; Schmartz, Zerbe, Abou-Hadeed, & Robinson, 2014; van Wageningen et al., 1998). As a second example, while the biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified and the crystal structure of the enzyme determined, a firm biochemical characterization of the FAD-dependent halogenase CmlS involved in the biosynthesis of 2 is still elusive (He, Magarvey, Piraee, & Vining, 2001; Podzelinska et al., 2010). Two challenges precipitate this knowledge gap. First, the timing of haloge-nation relative to other biochemical modifications in multimodular schemes involving CP-tethered substrates can be hard to decipher. Second, synthesis of CP-tethered substrates in itself can be challenging as is described in detail later. CPs are small proteins with a conserved four-helical bundle structure. The side chain hydroxyl of a conserved serine residue in apo-CPs is post-translationally esterified to a phosphopantetheine \u201carm\u201d derived from coenzyme A (CoA-SH), a transformation afforded by phosphopantetheinyl transferases to yield holo-CPs (Fig. 3) (Beld, Sonnenschein, Vickery, Noel, & Burkart, 2014). Following esterification with phosphopantetheine, the terminal thiol of holo-CPs is condensed with adenylated carboxylic acids in an ATP-dependent ligation reaction to yield acyl-S-CPs. Acyl-S-CPs serve to carry carboxylic acids through reaction schemes while the carbox-ylic acid is activated by the formation of the high-energy thioester bondwith the phosphopantetheine arm. Following modifications of the acyl moiety, the thioester bond can be displaced by various nucleophiles, by water to yield carboxylic acids, by alcohols to yield esters and lactones, by amines to yield amides and lactams, by carbanions to yield Claisen condensation products, or transthioesterified. These modifications are extensively repre-sented in primary metabolism and in natural product biosynthetic pathways.",
        "336 Hem R. Thapa et al.",
        "CPs, when expressed as recombinant proteins in heterologous hosts such as Escherichia coli, are posttranslationally modified in situ to their corresponding holo forms by phosphopantetheinyl transferases that are pre-sent in the heterologous host\u2019s proteome. However, these conversions usu-ally do not reach completion and heterologously expressed CPs are purified as a mixture of apo and holo states. The discovery and characterization of the broadly substrate tolerant phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp has provided a straightforward, and now widely employed, route for the conversion of apo-CPs to holo-CPs (Quadri et al., 1998). However, the conversion of holo-CPs to acyl-S-CPs can be complicated by the nonavailability of an appropriate ligase, specifically when the carboxylic acid to be ligated to the holo-CP is an advanced biosynthetic intermediate for which a cognate ligase does not exist.",
        "Strategies to address this challenge have been devised. Numerous biosyn-thetic enzymes that employ acyl-S-CoA and acyl-S-CP substrates have been reported to use abbreviated substrates, such asN-acetylcysteamine thioesters (NAC thioesters, Fig. 3). Strategies for the elaboration of NAC thioesters were recently reviewed (Franke & Hertweck, 2016). An alternate strategy is based on the substrate tolerance of Sfp. The crystal structure of Sfp in com-plex with CoA-SH reveals that the enzyme makes extensive contacts with",
        "Fig. 3 Posttranslational maturation of apo-CP by transfer of the phosphopantetheine arm from CoA-SH to the side chain hydroxyl of a conserved serine residue to yield holo-CP, followed by formation of the thioester bond with a carboxylic acid to generate acyl-S-CPs. In some cases, acyl-S-CP substrates can be substituted by abbreviated NAC thioesters. An alternate route to generating acyl-S-CPs relies on the transfer of the acyl-S-phosphopantetheine from acyl-S-CoAs, chemically synthesized by the ligation of CoA-SH with carboxylic acids, by the phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp. The E. coli CP (PDB: 4ETW) is shown in cartoon representation as a representative example of the ter-tiary structure of CPs and the site for the conserved Ser residue (Agarwal, Lin, Lukk, Nair, & Cronan, 2012).",

        "the 30-phosphoadenosine and the pyrophosphate moieties of CoA-SH. However, the cysteamine moiety is not actively engaged by the enzyme (Reuter, Mofid, Marahiel, & Ficner, 1999). Thus, Sfp can directly catalyze the production of acyl-S-CPs starting from apo-CPs by the transfer of the acyl-S-phosphopantetheine moiety from acyl-S-CoAs (Fig. 3). This strategy requires the elaboration of acyl-S-CoAs by the synthetic ligation of carboxylic acids to CoA-SH, a reaction that proceeds in low yields while using typically high-priced CoA-SH as a substrate, and requires a chromatographic purification of the acyl-S-CoA product (Mishra & Drueckhammer, 2000). Hence, alternate routes for the elaboration of acyl-S-CoAs have been sought (Peter, Vogeli, Cortina, & Erb, 2016). By adopting the substrate promiscuity of the CoA-SH biosynthetic enzymes together with the broad substrate tolerance of Sfp, we have recently reported a chemoenzymatic scheme for the elaboration of acyl-S-CoAs and acyl-S-CPs at a multimilligram scale (Agarwal et al., 2015; Nazi, Koteva, &Wright, 2004; Strauss & Begley, 2002). These procedures are out-lined in Section 3 together with mass spectrometric assays to query the acyl-ation states of CPs. In Section 4, we describe procedures to assay for the activity of FAD-dependent halogenases using acyl-S-CP substrates together with themass spectrometric characterization of the assay products. Using these procedures, for the first time, we experimentally validate the distinction between physiological chlorinases and brominases.",

        "The biosynthesis of the halogenated pyrrole containing marine natural products pentabromopseudilin (3, Fig. 4), marinopyrrole A (4), and chlo-rizidine (5) each involves halogenation of a pyrrolyl-S-CP intermediate by the FAD-dependent halogenases Bmp2, Mpy16, and Clz5, respectively (Agarwal et al., 2014; Mantovani & Moore, 2013; Yamanaka, Ryan, Gulder, Hughes, & Moore, 2012). As described above, ligases that append pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid to the corresponding holo-S-CPs (Bmp1, Mpy15, and Clz18, respectively) do not exist, since pyrrolyl-S-CPs are advanced biosynthetic intermediates that are derived by the enzymatic oxidation of prolyl-S-CPs (Fig. 4) (Agarwal et al., 2014; Thomas, Burkart, & Walsh, 2002; Walsh, Garneau-Tsodikova, & Howard-Jones, 2006). It should be noted that the synthesis and halogenation of pyrrolyl-S-CPs are not restricted to marine natural products. The discovery of gene clusters encoding produc-tion of 3\u20135was inspired by the prior characterization of themolecular logic for the construction of the dichlorinated pyrrole moiety in the terrestrial natural product pyoluteorin (6) (Dorrestein, Yeh, Garneau-Tsodikova, Kelleher, & Walsh, 2005; Thomas et al., 2002).",

        "As ATP-dependent ligases that ligate pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid to holo-CPs are not available, alternate strategies have been employed for the synthesis of pyrrolyl-S-CP substrates in order to assay the activities of the FAD-dependent halogenases as illustrated in Fig. 4. In a strategy that mimics the natural product biosynthetic scheme, ATP-dependent ligases are used to ligate L-Pro to holo-CPs to generate prolyl-S-CPs, followed by oxidation of the prolyl heterocycle to the aromatic pyrrolyl ring by FAD-dependent dehydrogenases (Dorrestein et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2002). This approach is complicated by the FAD-dependent dehydrogenase being difficult to purify, and which does not yield stoichiometric conversion of the prolyl-S-CP substrate to the pyrrolyl-S-CP product (Agarwal et al., 2014; Dorrestein et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2002).

        "4. HALOGENATION OF Acyl-S-CPs 4.1 Discussion",
        "FAD-dependent halogenases acting on substrates tethered to CPs are mech-anistically identical to FAD-dependent halogenases acting on small-molecule substrates such as L-tryptophan (Fig. 2). Halogenases acting on CP-tethered substrates routinely catalyze multiple halogenations on their CP-tethered aromatic substrates. For instance, the halogenase Bmp2 brominates all four carbon atoms of a pyrrole ring while Mpy16, Clz5, and PltA dichlorinate the pyrrole ring (Dorrestein et al., 2005; El Gamal et al., 2016; Mantovani & Moore, 2013) (Fig. 4). Note, while Bmp2 tetrabrominates the pyrrole ring, a tetrabrominated product will not be pro-duced with the absence of a partner thioesterase enzyme (El Gamal et al., 2016). In the absence of the thioesterase, a tribrominated product, as shown in Fig. 4, will predominate. The halogenase HrmQ, involved in the biosyn-thesis of hormaomycin, only monochlorinates the pyrrole ring (Hofer et al., 2011). Similarly, the FAD-dependent halogenase AltN likely mono-and dibrominates the phenyl ring en route production of the alterochromides (Ross, Gulland, Dorrestein, & Moore, 2015), while the chlorinase SgcC3 only monochlorinates the phenyl ring during the biosynthesis of the enediyne C-1027 (Lin, Van Lanen, & Shen, 2007). FAD-halogenases that work on small organic molecules exclusively catalyze monohalogenations in a regiospecific fashion which is perhaps a result of the highly ordered binding of the substrate in the halogenase active site (Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017; Bitto et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2009). While a crystal structure of FAD-dependent halogenase with a CP-tethered sub-strate is not available yet, the active sites of Bmp2, Mpy16, and PltA seem",
        "353Chemoenzymatic Synthesis",
        "to be more accommodating of substrates of different steric sizes (El Gamal et al., 2016; Pang, Garneau-Tsodikova, & Tsodikov, 2015). Recent discov-ery of the bifunctional methyltransferase-halogenase AoiQ and the MalA/ MalA\u2019 indole halogenases, together with the fungal halogenase CazI, how-ever challenge this notion and is likely to further expand the mechanistic repertoire of FAD-dependent halogenases (Chankhamjon et al., 2016; Fraley et al., 2017; Sato et al., 2016). In this section, we focus on the description of the unique activities of FAD-dependent halogenases that affect multiple halogenations on their aro-matic substrates. We describe the procedures to assay for the activity of the pyrrolyl-S-Bmp1 tribrominase Bmp2 and the pyrrolyl-S-dichlorinase Mpy16. FAD-dependent halogenases require a partner flavin reductase that provides FADH2 to the halogenase (Fig. 2). We employ the E. coli flavin reductase SsuE for this purpose (Eichhorn, van der Ploeg, & Leisinger, 1999). Electrons required for the reduction of FAD by SsuE are derived from NADPH. In the assay described below, NADPH is regenerated by the thermostable phosphite dehydrogenase PtdH in situ (Fig. 2) (Johannes et al., 2007). Using these procedures, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, that physiological chlorinases as defined by Drennan and coworkers can chlorinate as well as brominate (Blasiak & Drennan, 2009). However, the brominase Bmp2 can only brominate and is incapable of chlorination activity, thus providing a firm experimentally validated dis-tinction between physiological chlorinases and brominases.",

Hence, the activity of a chlorinase is fun-damentally different from a brominase, in that, a chlorinase (such as Mpy16) is an effective brominating catalyst depending on the relative concentration of halides in the assay. However, a brominase (such as Bmp2) is specific for incorporating bromide.

        "obstacle to investigating the reactions catalyzed by halogenase that require CP-tethered substrates. Crystal structures of halogenases in complex with their small-molecule organic substrates and products, such as for the Trp halogenases, have been critical in advancing our mechanistic understanding of FAD-dependent halogenases and their engineering for novel applications (Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017; Latham et al., 2018). However, a cocrystal structure of a FAD-dependent halogenase in complex with a CP-tethered substrate has so far been elusive. In addition to the halogenase, cocrystallization requires access to large quantities of highly pure substrates, and the lack of the above-mentioned crystal structure is perhaps reflective of lack of access to these substrates needed to drive these efforts forward. The procedures describe in this study will enable these efforts in the future.",
        "Mechanistically, FAD-dependent halogenases that employ CP-tethered substrates are presumed to be identical to FAD-dependent halogenases that employ small-molecule substrates such as L-Trp. The structural engagement of the FAD cofactor and the positioning of key catalytic resides for the two subclasses of FAD-dependent halogenases is highly similar. However, some key biochemical differences remain to be addressed. Primary among these is the absence of a catalytic Glu reside in acyl-S-CP halogenases (Fig. 14). To facilitate a electrophilic aromatic substitution by the halenium, the side chain of this Glu residue is postulated to serve as the catalytic base to abstract a proton from the substrate molecule, a role that is supported by kinetic and structural studies (Dong et al., 2005; Flecks et al., 2008). Thus, the",
        "361Chemoenzymatic Synthesis",
        "identity of the analogous catalytic base is still elusive for acyl-S-CP halogenases. Addressing these mechanistic questions will undoubtedly be aided by availability of a cocrystal structure of a FAD-dependent halogenase in complex with its cognate acyl-S-CP substrate. While this study specifi-cally deals with FAD-dependent halogenases, these procedures described herein can be extended to other classes of halogenases as well. Most perti-nently, numerous \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent nonheme Fe(II) (NHFe) halogenases have been described in literature that require substrates that are tethered to CPs (Agarwal, Miles, et al., 2017). However, the activities of several of these enzymes have not been reconstituted in vitro, perhaps due to lack of access to CP-tethered substrates. Owing to high abundance of halides in seawater, the marine environ-ment is an exceptionally rich source of halogenated natural products, specif-ically, of brominated natural products that are exclusively identified from marine sources (Blunt, Copp, Keyzers, Munro, & Prinsep, 2017). The existence of brominated natural products implies that brominases, such as Bmp2, have devised a \u201cmolecular filter\u201d that rejects chloride being used as a substrate by the enzyme. This filter is extraordinarily selective given the None600-fold higher concentration of chloride in seawater as compared to bromide. The chlorinases such as Mpy16, on the other hand, do not exert a similar halide selectivity filter. Chlorinases are equally adept at incorporat-ing chloride and bromide. Hence, it is likely that the presence of chlorinated natural products in the marine environment, as by extension in the terrestrial environment as well, is a consequence of greater abundance and availability of chloride as compared to bromide.",
