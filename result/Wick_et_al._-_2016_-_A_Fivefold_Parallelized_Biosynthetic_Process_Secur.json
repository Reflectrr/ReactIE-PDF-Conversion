During their biosynthesis, some members of the melleolide family of compounds undergo monochlorination of the aromatic moiety, whose biochemical and genetic basis was not known previously. This first study on basidiomycete halogenases presents the biochemical in vitro characterization of five flavin-dependent A. mellea enzymes (ArmH1 to ArmH5) that were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli. We demon-strate that all five enzymes transfer a single chlorine atom to the melleolide backbone. A 5-fold, secured biosynthetic step during natural product assembly is unprecedented. Typically, flavin-dependent halogenases are categorized into enzymes acting on free compounds as opposed to those requiring a carrier-protein-bound acceptor substrate. The enzymes characterized in this study clearly turned over free substrates. Phylogenetic clades of halogenases suggest that all fungal enzymes share an ancestor and re-flect a clear divergence between ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The basidiomycete genus Armillaria includes numerous speciesthat are known as notorious butt and root rot agents (1). They are globally distributed as hardwood or conifer pathogens (2) in managed and unmanaged forests and also damage fruit trees and grapes. Therefore, the genus is best known for its economic bur-den. Despite being serious plant pathogens, Armillaria species also play a positive environmental role, as they depolymerize lignocel-lulose and therefore help maintain the carbon flux in ecosystems. A remarkable physiological feature of Armillaria species is the capacity to produce melleolide natural products (Fig. 1) (3\u20137). These secondary metabolites feature a unique molecular scaffold composed of an orsellinic acid (2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoic acid) (Fig. 1) moiety esterified to a tricyclic sesquiterpene (pro-toilludane) alcohol. The melleolides are intriguing, as they show two distinct structure-activity relationships for their cytotoxic and antifungal bioactivities (8). Phytotoxic activities have also been established (9, 10). Further, the melleolides represent one of the largest fungal natural product families with more than 60 struc-tural variants. This degree of variation stems from a permuta-tional organization of the biosynthesis that combines hydroxyla-tion at various positions of the sesquiterpene, oxidation of the primary alcohol at C-1 to an aldehyde or carboxy group, shift or reduction of the cyclohexene double bond, and methyl ether for-mation at O-5=. Regioselective chlorination at C-6= also contrib-utes to the structural diversity, reflected by about 25 described chlorinated melleolides. None of the enzymes that modify the melleolide scaffold has been discovered to date. However, the protoilludene synthase Pro1 (11) and the orsellinic acid synthase ArmB (12) that elabo-rate the melleolide core structure have been characterized and described. These enzymes and those hypothesized to catalyze the above-mentioned modifications are encoded in a contiguous sin-gle-copy cluster of genes (Fig. 2), as is evident from the published genomic sequence of Armillaria mellea (13). Intriguingly, the gene cluster does not include any halogenase gene. Covalent attach-ment of a halogen atom represents a frequently found modifica-tion of microbial natural products. Currently, more than 4,000 mostly chlorinated or brominated compounds of biological origin are known (14). They include potent bioactive compounds, such as the HSP90 inhibitor radiciol from Chaetomium chiversii and Metacordyceps (Pochonia) chlamydosporia (15, 16) or the cytotoxic endiyne C-1027 (17) of Streptomyces globisporus. Even some clin-ically used antibiotics and anticancer drugs show halogenation, e.g., the antifungal agent griseofulvin of Penicilllium aethiopicum (18) and the anticancer drug calicheamicin of Micromonospora echinospora subsp. calichensis (19), which carry chlorine and io-dine atoms, respectively. The gene clusters for the above-men-tioned biosyntheses all encode one flavin-dependent halogenase. Using melleolide F as a model representative of this class of compounds, we provide evidence that five actively transcribed genes outside the A. mellea melleolide biosynthesis gene cluster code for functional flavin-dependent halogenases (ArmH1 to ArmH5) that catalyze the transfer of a single chlorine atom to melleolides. This first study on basidiomycete halogenases, there-fore, reveals an unprecedented case of a biosynthetic process that is secured by a 5-fold redundancy. In vitro characterization using heterologously produced enzymes suggests that these halogenases act on free substrates, i.e., they do not depend on carrier-protein-tethered acceptor molecules.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General methods, strains, and chemicals. Chemicals, organic solvents, media, reagents, and antibiotics were purchased from Becton-Dickinson, Roth, Sigma-Aldrich, and VWR, except melleolide F, which was enriched to about 90% purity from A. mellea mycelium, following a published procedure (20). Molecular biology methods followed the protocols sup-plied with the kits, enzymes, and reagents (Fermentas, New England Bio-Labs, Promega, Thermo, and Zymo Research). A. mellea DSM3731 was routinely maintained on malt extract-peptone (MEP) agar, pH 5.6, at 24\u00b0C. Liquid cultures were grown in glucose minimal medium (GMM) (21) at 24\u00b0C and shaken at 180 rpm for 12 to 14 days in the dark. Station-ary cultures were grown in penicillin flasks in 1 liter MEP broth. For bromine and iodine feeding, KCl was replaced by KBr and KI, respec-tively, in the GMM. In silico sequence analysis. The published genomic-DNA sequence of A. mellea (13) was searched using the protein sequences of the protoil-ludene cyclase Pro1 (GenBank accession no. AGR34199), the polyketide synthase (PKS) ArmB (GenBank accession no. AFL91703), and the halo-genase ArmH1 (GenBank accession no. AEM76785) as queries (11, 12, 22) and using the BLASTP function integrated in the Joint Genome Insti-tute\u2019s Genome Portal (23). Cloning of armH1 to armH5 cDNA. Total RNA was extracted from A. mellea DSM3731 mycelium under melleolide-producing conditions. My-celia were filtered under vacuum, washed with distilled H2O (dH2O), and ground by mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen before total RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) by follow-ing the manufacturer\u2019s spin protocol. First-strand synthesis of armH1 and armH2 was accomplished with the oligonucleotide primer cHalR2 (Table 1) and ImProm-II reverse transcriptase, using previously described pa-rameters (24). Using 1 Nonel of the first-strand synthesis reaction mixture as the template, the armH1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymer-ase (94\u00b0C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 4 min; final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min) and oligonucleotide primers cHalF1 and cHalR1 (Table 1). The PCR product was ligated into pGem-11Zf(None) via EcoRI and BamHI to yield the plasmid pMM1. After se-quencing, a correct clone was used as a template for a second PCR under the following conditions: Pfu polymerase and primers Hal1-28F and Hal1-28R for 25 cycles (94\u00b0C for 40 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 4 min, and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min). The resulting PCR product was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the vector pET28a, yielding the plasmid pMM21. The armH2 cDNA was procured as described for armH1 but using primer Hal2R2 for first-strand synthesis and oligonucleotide prim-ers Hal2F1 and Hal2R1 for cDNA amplification (Table 1). The PCR prod-uct was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET28a to give pMM13. For first-strand synthesis of armH3 to armH5, total RNA was primed with oligo(dT)18 primers and reverse transcribed using RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo). One microliter of first-strand synthesized armH3 to armH5 cDNA was amplified in a Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) PCR using the recommended master mix from the manufacturer with a final MgCl2 concentration of 2.0 mM. PCRs for armH3 to armH5 were primed with oligonucleotide pairs oJT073/oHJ01, oJT040/oJT041, and oJT042/oJT043, respectively (Table 1), using the following thermal-cycling parameters: initial denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 30 s; 30 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C (armH3) or 70\u00b0C (armH4 and armH5) for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min; and a final extension for 5 min at 72\u00b0C. Amplicons of armH3 to armH5 were ligated initially to pJET1.2 using the CloneJet PCR cloning kit and subsequently cut and ligated into equally cut pET28b to produce T7 expression plasmids pHJ28 (into NdeI and BamHI sites; armH3), pHJ14 (into NdeI and HindIII sites; armH4), and pHJ05 (into NdeI and EcoRI sites; armH5). The presence of insert integration was verified by DNA sequencing, and all molecular cloning was done in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue, selected by carbenicillin (pJET1.2) or kanamycin (pET28b). Cloning of the E. coli flavine reductase gene fre. The flavine reductase gene (fre) was amplified by PCR from genomic E. coli DNA using Pfu polymerase and primers FreN-F and FreN-R (Table 1) (30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 57\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 4 min and final extension of 72\u00b0C for 5 min). The PCR product was cloned into the NdeI and BglII sites of vector pET15b to yield plasmid pMM14. Heterologous protein production and purification. For production of ArmH1 to ArmH5, E. coli KRX was individually transformed with pMM21 (to express armH1), pMM13 (armH2), pHJ28 (armH3), pHJ14 (armH4), or pHJ05 (armH5). Each transformed E. coli strain was grown in 2None yeast extract-tryptone (YT) medium (supplemented with kanamycin [50 Noneg/ml]) in Erlenmeyer flasks (10 400-ml flasks) at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.4.

After an additional 18 h of shaking at 16\u00b0C, the cells were har-vested by centrifugation, cooled to 4\u00b0C, and lysed by sonication (3 times for 10 s each time). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with 2 ml (each) of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The resins were transferred onto gravity flow columns and washed with 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4; 300 mM NaCl) containing increasing imidazole concentrations (10 mM and 20 mM). Elution was performed with 2.5 ml of 400 mM imidazole. The enzymes were rebuffered in 3.5 ml phosphate buffer (100 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare). For bro-mination and iodination assays, NaCl was replaced with KBr or KI, re-spectively. The enzymes were concentrated with a 50-kDa-cutoff Amicon filter (Merck Millipore) and used for subsequent in vitro product forma-tion assays. To produce flavin reductase, E. coli BL21 transformed with pMM14 was grown in liquid LB medium containing 50 Noneg/ml carbenicil-lin at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm to an OD600 of 0.5 and then induced with IPTG (isopropyl-None-D-thiogalactopyranoside) (1 mM). Heterologous protein production proceeded overnight at 16\u00b0C. Purification of the N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged E. coli flavin reductase was carried out as described above for ArmH enzymes. In vitro halogenation assays. Freshly prepared ArmH enzymes were separately incubated at 25\u00b0C overnight in a total volume of 100 Nonel. The buffer was 100 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl (or KBr or KI, respectively), pH 7.4. The reaction mixture also contained 2 mM NADH, 10 NoneM flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), 2.4 units E. coli flavin reductase (Fre) to supply the respective halogenase with FADH2, and the acceptor substrate (25 NoneM melleolide F). Fre activity was determined by following a pub-lished procedure (25). Reactions with heat-inactivated enzyme (95\u00b0C for 10 min) were run in parallel as negative controls, in particular to exclude nonenzymatic chlorination by hypochlorite that might have formed spontaneously in the assays. To prepare the reaction mixtures for chro-matography, they were extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate plus 1% acetic acid (vol/vol), dried under reduced pressure, and redissolved in 100 Nonel of methanol. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In vitro reactions were analyzed on an Agilent 1200 high-performance liquid chromato-graph (HPLC) equipped with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (150 by 4.6 mm; 3.5-Nonem particle size). Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetate in H2O, and solvent B was acetonitrile. For melleolide analysis, a linear gra-dient from 50% B to 100% B within 16 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min was applied, followed by a wash step (100% B) for 5 min. Routine mass spec-trometry was performed on an Agilent 1260 chromatograph with a Zor-bax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (150 by 4.6 mm; 3.5-Nonem particle size) cou-pled with an Agilent 6130 mass detector using electrospray ionization in positive and negative modes and applying the gradient described above. Diode array detection was from a None of 200 to 500 nm, and chromatograms were extracted at a None of 254 nm. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESIMS) was performed on a Thermo Accela liquid chromatograph equipped with a Betasil C18 column (150 by 2.1 mm; 3-Nonem particle size) and fitted to an Exactive Orbitrap mass spec-trometer (ThermoFisher). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in H2O, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. For sample analysis, the column was washed with 95% H2O for 1 min, followed by a linear gradi-ent (flow rate, 0.2 ml/min) from 5% B to 98% B within 15 min, and held at this relationship for 3 min. In silico sequence and phylogenetic analysis. To identify exon-intron junctions in silico, we used FGENESH (Softberry, Mount Kisco, NY) and Augustus (26) software as described previously (27). Primary sequences of FAD-dependent halogenases were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm (28) implemented as a plug-in for Geneious 7.1 (Biomatters Ltd., Auck-land, New Zealand). The alignment was exported and used to construct a phylogenetic network based on the neighbor net method implemented in the SplitsTree4 program (29). For the construction of a phylogenetic tree, the alignment was exported to MEGA6 (30). Based on a neighbor-joining tree, the optimal model of evolution was determined to be the Le-Gascuel (LG) model (31). A maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis was run using the LG model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. A FAD-dependent p-hydroxy-benzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) (Molecular Modeling Database [MMDB] accession no. 57109) from Pseudomonas fluorescens was used as the out-group to root the tree. The GenBank accession numbers of all proteins are compiled in Table S1 in the supplemental material. For phylogenetic anal-ysis, the sequences of the tryptophan halogenases RebH (32), PrnA (33), and PyrH (34) were used, all of them acting on free precursor molecules. We also included SgcC3, involved in halogenation of the enediyne anti-tumor substance C-1027 (17), BhaA from balhimycin biosynthesis (35), and PltA from pyoluteorin biosynthesis (36). All of the last four enzymes have been shown experimentally to depend on carrier-protein-bound in-termediates. The halogenase CndH (37) was suggested to interact with a carrier protein, as well, although direct evidence was not provided. AviH from Streptomyces viridochromogenes was included, as it chlorinates an orsellinic acid moiety at two positions during avilamycin biosynthesis (38), as well as the halogenase CalO3, which transfers iodine to orsellinic acid (19). Along with the five A. mellea halogenases, we included unchar-acterized basidiomycete halogenases of Heterobasidion irregulare (39) and Serpula lacrymans (40) and characterized halogenases from ascomycetes to the phylogenetic analysis. From the latter group of fungi, we added Rdc2 (41) and RadH (16), both involved in radicicol biosynthesis, as well as Gsfl of Penicillium aethiopicum, which is encoded in the griseofulvin gene cluster (18); PtaM from pestheic acid biosynthesis in Pestalotiopsis fici (42); GedL from the geodin pathway in Aspergillus terreus (43); and AclH from the aspirochlorine pathway in Aspergillus oryzae (44). To root the tree, we used the FAD-dependent PHBH of P. fluorescens (45) as the outgroup. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The DNA sequences of armH3 to armH5 were deposited in GenBank under the accession num-bers KT819179 to KT819181, respectively. RESULTS The melleolide gene cluster lacks a halogenase gene. In order to study the genetic basis underlying melleolide biosynthesis, we first searched the genomic sequence of A. mellea DSM3731 (13) using the primary sequences of the protoilludene cyclase Pro1 and the polyketide synthase ArmB (11, 12). Notably, the query sequences hit loci that were separated by only nine genes. The result pointed to a clustered arrangement of melleolide biosynthesis genes. This putative gene cluster includes five genes coding for P450-depen-dent monooxygenases (Fig. 2A, proteins 476 and 479 to 482), four NADNone-dependent oxidoreductases (proteins 468, 469, 474, and TABLE 1 Oligonucleotide primers used in this study Oligonucleotide Sequence (5= to 3=) cHalF1 CATCGGATCCCATCATGGAAGAAC cHalR1 CTTGAAATAGAATTCGGTTTGCC cHalR2 CACAGCTCTTCATTATAGCCTAC FreN-F AGAAAGCATATGACAACCTTA FreN-R AGCTTTTTAGATCTCAGATAAATGC Hal1-28F ATCCCCATATGGAAGAACAAGTG Hal1-28R CTCGGATCCGGTTTGCCGCTAAG Hal2F1 CAGTTCCATATGGTTACACAAGTGCC Hal2R1 CCCTTTGGATCCAGTCTAAAAATCTACG Hal2R2 AATTCATAACCCTTTCGTTACAGTC oJT040 AGCCACCATATGAGCTCACTATTGCC oJT041 CTACGTAAGCTTAGTGTACGTTTTTCAGCC oJT042 ATACCTCATATGCCTTCCGAATACGTGC oJT043 AAAAGAATTCTTAGGCCCTGACCAATCCAAGC oJT073 TTTTTCATATGGAAGCGCAAGTGCC oHJ01 AAAAGGATCCCTAAGCACACACGAG Wick et al. 1198 aem.asm.org February 2016 Volume 82 Number 4Applied and Environmental Microbiology D ow nl oa de d fr om  http s: //j ou rn al s. as m .o rg /jo ur na l/a em  on 01  Jun e 20 22  by 12 8. 17 4. 12 4. 13 0. 478), one flavin-dependent oxidoreductase (protein 475), and one O-methyltransferase (protein 473). The P450-dependent en-zymes may be involved in protoilludene hydroxylation to elabo-rate melleolides with multiple alcohol groups, such as melleolide D (3), which carries alcohol functionalities at C-4, C-5, C-10, and C-13. The role of the NADNone-dependent enzymes remains un-known. Numerous melleolides, e.g., arnamial (6), show 5=-O-methylation of the aromatic moiety. This methylation step may be catalyzed by the methyltransferase encoded in the cluster. Search-ing for a halogenase, a potential candidate encoded in the cluster is the flavin-dependent oxidoreductase (protein 475). However, it lacks the strongly conserved motif GWXWXXPL (34) of FAD-dependent halogenases and showed homology to glucose-meth-anol-choline oxidoreductase instead. Thus, we hypothesized that protein 475 does not possess halogenase activity but might repre-sent the dehydrogenase yielding the aldehyde in position 1 of ar-namial and other melleolides. In turn, this suggested that the ha-logenase required for melleolide chlorination is not encoded in the gene cluster. Identification of halogenase genes in the A. mellea genome. Prior to the release of the A. mellea genomic sequence, we identi-fied the sequences of armH1 and armH2 (GenBank accession no. JF739169 and JF739170), i.e., two genes coding for putative flavin-dependent halogenases. These two genes are located on a contig-uous 71.5-kb portion of the A. mellea genome (22) that is not part of the melleolide biosynthesis gene cluster. By searching the genomic sequence, we have now identified three additional puta-tive halogenase genes, here referred to as armH3, armH4, and armH5 (GenBank accession no. KT819179 through KT819181), which are located neither within nor near the melleolide gene locus nor close to armH1 and armH2. For all five halogenase genes (armH1 to armH5), cDNA was successfully procured from myce-lium, confirming they are actively transcribed genes. Another two gene models encoding putative halogenases were incomplete, with missing portions across the respective genes, which is why we as-sume misassembled sequence data or pseudogenes. The reading frames of the genes armH1, armH2, armH3, and armH5 are disrupted by 9 and that of armH4 by 10 introns (Fig. 2B) and encode ArmH1 to ArmH5 (Table 2), which possess the canonical halogenase signature sequence (GW[A/V]W[F/L]I) of hydrophobic and aromatic residues. In vitro characterization of A. mellea halogenases ArmH1 to ArmH5. To test if any or all of the five A. mellea halogenases function in chlorine transfer during melleolide biosynthesis, we expressed their coding sequences heterologously in E. coli KRX so as to produce N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins. The enzymes were purified by metal affinity and anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 3) and characterized in vitro. Melleolide F (Fig. 1) (46) is a typical representative of the melleolide family of compounds that features a None2,3-protoilludene terpene and an un-modified orsellinic acid moiety. Melleolide F can be procured from mycelial cultures in sufficient quantity and was used as a potential chlorine acceptor substrate in this study. Product formation was investigated by HPLC and HR-ESIMS. When given free melleolide F as the substrate, product formation could be proven in the chromatograms for all five ArmH enzymes by HPLC analysis. In addition to the melleolide F peak at a reten-tion time (tR) of 10.8 min, formation of a chlorinated product was chromatographically verified at a tR of 11.6 min (Fig. 4A to E). In the high-resolution mass spectra for ArmH1 to ArmH5 reac-tions, the new peaks corresponded to the mass of 6=-chloro-melleolide F (Table 3) and displayed the typical pattern for isotopic abundance of the stable chlorine isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl. Based on the areas under the curve, product formation was most pronounced with ArmH4. Bromination by ArmH4. We selected ArmH4 as a model to gain insight into the biosynthetic capacities of A. mellea haloge-nases. As it has been established that chlorinases may also catalyze bromination, at least in vitro (34), in vitro product formation as-says were performed as described above but with addition of the potassium salts of iodide or bromide, rather than sodium chlo-TABLE 2 Active halogenases/halogenase genes of A. mellea Protein name Length (aaa) Protein IDb GenBank accession no.

While iodination was not observed, product formation was detected by HPLC and HR-ESIMS when bromide was present (Fig. 4F). Evidence for melleolide bromination came from the masses m/z 479.1075 and 481.1056 (Table 3) and the unique nearly 1:1 abundance ratio of the stable bromine isotopes 79Br and 81Br (Fig. 4F). These results indicated that a single bromine atom was introduced into melle-olide F, likely to C-6=, as noted above (Fig. 1). Functional categories are not applicable to fungal haloge-nases. It has previously been suggested that halogenases can be grouped according to their substrate requirements (37). Group A includes enzymes that act on free substrates, while group B re-quires carrier-bound substrates for catalytic turnover. The au-thors differentiate these two groups by a phenylalanine residue (Phe312 in CndH, group B), which is equivalent to a glutamate residue (Glu346 in PrnA) in group A enzymes. According to these categories, all A. mellea halogenases would fall into group B of carrier-protein-dependent halogenases, as they show a phenyl-alanine residue (positions 326, 326, 327, 335, and 326 in ArmH1 to ArmH5, respectively). However, our results clearly prove that all of the above-mentioned halogenases act on free substrates and that the halogen-carbon bond is established as a post-PKS-biosyn-thetic step. This is in agreement with a previous study on the ascomycetous Rdc2 (41), which was shown to chlorinate a free substrate in vitro but has a phenylalanine at position 328. We therefore assume that this signature residue\u2014 discovered with bacterial enzymes\u2014is not applicable to differentiate halogenases of basidiomycete origin. To gain more insight into the evolution of FAD-dependent halogenases, we constructed a phylogenetic network (Fig. 5) and an ML tree (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) of experimentally characterized FAD-dependent halogenases and some putative halogenases encoded in genomes of basidiomy-cetes. The resulting network and tree suggested that fungal halogenases form a monophyletic clade. Thus, our phyloge-netic analyses support the notion that categorization into group A or B is not applicable to fungal enzymes.

Intriguingly, ArmH1 to ArmH5 are not monophyletic, and only ArmH1 to ArmH3 form a branch of closely related enzymes. DISCUSSION Our findings reported here show that halogenases ArmH1 to ArmH5 act on melleolide F, i.e., on free substrates, and that they do not require carrier-protein-tethered intermediates. Cumula-tively, we identified these halogenases as melleolide biosynthesis enzymes. We cannot a priori exclude the possibility that a position other than C-6= served as an acceptor site for the halogen atom during catalysis in vitro. However, all of the approximately 25 chlorinated melleolides described to date exclusively show 6= chlorination. Thus, a different halogen acceptor position would be inconsistent with all previously established structures. Mechanistically, different strategies have evolved indepen-dently to install halogen atoms onto natural product scaffolds, making use of either the halide anion, hypochlorous acid, or a halogen radical (47, 48). Recently, even a new variant of halo-genating enzymes that belongs to the nonheme-iron-depen-dent halogenases was reported (49).

Fungal halogenases are monophyletic and reflect the phylogenetic split between ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The functional categories group A (halogenases accepting free substrates) and group B (carrier-protein-bound substrates) are indicated by boldface letters in parentheses. These categories do not strictly correlate with phylogenetic clades. The scale bar indicates the uncorrected pairwise distance.

FAD as a cofactor and use a halide anion and molecular oxygen to produce hypochlorous acid as a halogenating agent. Protein crystallography greatly helped in understanding the structural basis of regioselective formation of the carbon-halogen bond (50\u201353). A. mellea halogenase genes encode the signature motif GW(A/V)W(F/L)I. In the three-dimensional protein structure, these residues line a tunnel inside the enzyme through which the hypochloric acid is routed from the flavin toward the halogen acceptor substrate binding site (50). Also, the active-site lysine was found in all A. mellea halogenases (K77 in ArmH5 and K76 in all the others). Based on the crystal structure of the chondromycin halogenase CndH (37), it has previously been suggested that flavin-dependent halogenases fall into two functionally dissimilar groups accepting free substrates (group A) or carrier-protein-bound substrates (group B). Although all the halogenases investigated in this study, as well as Rdc2 from Pochonia chlamydosporia, seem to accept free substrates, there are not enough data yet to assume that this is a general trait of fungal halogenases. However, rules deduced from bacterial sequences to predict their placement in either functional group are not appropriate for fungal halogenases. Alternatively, categorization of enzymes by activity on free versus enzyme-teth-ered substrates may not be as critical as previously assumed to draw a demarcation line between groups A and B. The type of substrate (tryptophan versus others) also seems to play a role, which would explain the major split (seen in Fig. S1 in the supple-mental material) between bacterial clade 1 and all other haloge-nases. Therefore, further biochemical studies are necessary to shed more light on this fascinating enzyme family, in particular as members of basidiomycete origin have remained completely uninvestigated, even though aromatic haloorganic natural products are known from these fungi. Besides the melleolides, examples include the alcalinaphenols from Mycena alcalina (54) and stephanosporin of Stephanospora caroticolor (55). Hence, our work represents the first biochemically and genetically character-ized basidiomycete halogenases. Phylogenetically, our work also revealed that ArmH1 to ArmH3 have most likely evolved by gene duplication within the A. mellea lineage and that ArmH4 and ArmH5 seem to have distinct phylogenetic histories. However, it is premature to speculate if any functional clusters within the fun-gal clades can be deduced from the phylogenetic tree. Again, more biochemical studies are warranted to improve functional pre-dictions of putative halogenases unveiled by high-throughput-sequencing projects. In various cases, e.g., for the antibiotic vancomycin and the antitumor agent salinosporamide, increased bioactivity has been attributed to the presence of halogen atoms (47). However, in the case of the melleolides, the physiological reason for introducing a chlorine atom is unclear. Available stud-ies on structure-activity relationships do not support strongly changed bioactivity through chlorination (8, 9, 20). Hence, a role in detoxification of melleolides through halogenation also can-not be assumed, and the reason why A. mellea secures chlorina-tion of its toxic natural products to the degree described here remains elusive. Although redundantly encoded pathways are known from both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (56\u201358), a 5-fold parallelized biosynthetic step is unprecedented and war-rants further investigation of the underlying ecological or envi-ronmental reason.

        "The basidiomycetous tree pathogen Armillaria mellea (honey mushroom) produces a large variety of structurally related antibiotically active and phytotoxic natural products, referred to as the melleolides. During their biosynthesis, some members of the melleolide family of compounds undergo monochlorination of the aromatic moiety, whose biochemical and genetic basis was not known previously. This first study on basidiomycete halogenases presents the biochemical in vitro characterization of five flavin-dependent A. mellea enzymes (ArmH1 to ArmH5) that were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli. We demon-strate that all five enzymes transfer a single chlorine atom to the melleolide backbone. A 5-fold, secured biosynthetic step during natural product assembly is unprecedented. Typically, flavin-dependent halogenases are categorized into enzymes acting on free compounds as opposed to those requiring a carrier-protein-bound acceptor substrate. The enzymes characterized in this study clearly turned over free substrates. Phylogenetic clades of halogenases suggest that all fungal enzymes share an ancestor and re-flect a clear divergence between ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.",
        "The",
        "basidiomycete genus Armillaria includes numerous speciesthat are known as notorious butt and root rot agents (1). They",
        "are globally distributed as hardwood or conifer pathogens (2) in managed and unmanaged forests and also damage fruit trees and grapes. Therefore, the genus is best known for its economic bur-den. Despite being serious plant pathogens, Armillaria species also play a positive environmental role, as they depolymerize lignocel-lulose and therefore help maintain the carbon flux in ecosystems.",
        "A remarkable physiological feature of Armillaria species is the capacity to produce melleolide natural products (Fig. 1) (3\u20137). These secondary metabolites feature a unique molecular scaffold composed of an orsellinic acid (2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoic acid) (Fig. 1) moiety esterified to a tricyclic sesquiterpene (pro-toilludane) alcohol. The melleolides are intriguing, as they show two distinct structure-activity relationships for their cytotoxic and antifungal bioactivities (8). Phytotoxic activities have also been established (9, 10). Further, the melleolides represent one of the largest fungal natural product families with more than 60 struc-tural variants. This degree of variation stems from a permuta-tional organization of the biosynthesis that combines hydroxyla-tion at various positions of the sesquiterpene, oxidation of the primary alcohol at C-1 to an aldehyde or carboxy group, shift or reduction of the cyclohexene double bond, and methyl ether for-mation at O-5=. Regioselective chlorination at C-6= also contrib-utes to the structural diversity, reflected by about 25 described chlorinated melleolides.",
        "None of the enzymes that modify the melleolide scaffold has been discovered to date. However, the protoilludene synthase Pro1 (11) and the orsellinic acid synthase ArmB (12) that elabo-rate the melleolide core structure have been characterized and described. These enzymes and those hypothesized to catalyze the above-mentioned modifications are encoded in a contiguous sin-gle-copy cluster of genes (Fig. 2), as is evident from the published genomic sequence of Armillaria mellea (13). Intriguingly, the gene cluster does not include any halogenase gene. Covalent attach-ment of a halogen atom represents a frequently found modifica-",
        "tion of microbial natural products. Currently, more than 4,000 mostly chlorinated or brominated compounds of biological origin are known (14). They include potent bioactive compounds, such as the HSP90 inhibitor radiciol from Chaetomium chiversii and Metacordyceps (Pochonia) chlamydosporia (15, 16) or the cytotoxic endiyne C-1027 (17) of Streptomyces globisporus. Even some clin-ically used antibiotics and anticancer drugs show halogenation, e.g., the antifungal agent griseofulvin of Penicilllium aethiopicum (18) and the anticancer drug calicheamicin of Micromonospora echinospora subsp. calichensis (19), which carry chlorine and io-dine atoms, respectively. The gene clusters for the above-men-tioned biosyntheses all encode one flavin-dependent halogenase. Using melleolide F as a model representative of this class of compounds, we provide evidence that five actively transcribed genes outside the A. mellea melleolide biosynthesis gene cluster code for functional flavin-dependent halogenases (ArmH1 to ArmH5) that catalyze the transfer of a single chlorine atom to melleolides. This first study on basidiomycete halogenases, there-fore, reveals an unprecedented case of a biosynthetic process that is secured by a 5-fold redundancy. In vitro characterization using heterologously produced enzymes suggests that these halogenases act on free substrates, i.e., they do not depend on carrier-protein-tethered acceptor molecules.",

        "MATERIALS AND METHODS General methods, strains, and chemicals. Chemicals, organic solvents, media, reagents, and antibiotics were purchased from Becton-Dickinson, Roth, Sigma-Aldrich, and VWR, except melleolide F, which was enriched to about 90% purity from A. mellea mycelium, following a published procedure (20). Molecular biology methods followed the protocols sup-plied with the kits, enzymes, and reagents (Fermentas, New England Bio-Labs, Promega, Thermo, and Zymo Research). A. mellea DSM3731 was routinely maintained on malt extract-peptone (MEP) agar, pH 5.6, at 24\u00b0C. Liquid cultures were grown in glucose minimal medium (GMM) (21) at 24\u00b0C and shaken at 180 rpm for 12 to 14 days in the dark. Station-ary cultures were grown in penicillin flasks in 1 liter MEP broth. For bromine and iodine feeding, KCl was replaced by KBr and KI, respec-tively, in the GMM.",
        "In silico sequence analysis. The published genomic-DNA sequence of A. mellea (13) was searched using the protein sequences of the protoil-ludene cyclase Pro1 (GenBank accession no. AGR34199), the polyketide synthase (PKS) ArmB (GenBank accession no. AFL91703), and the halo-genase ArmH1 (GenBank accession no. AEM76785) as queries (11, 12, 22) and using the BLASTP function integrated in the Joint Genome Insti-tute\u2019s Genome Portal (23).",

First-strand synthesis of armH1 and",
        "armH2 was accomplished with the oligonucleotide primer cHalR2 (Table 1) and ImProm-II reverse transcriptase, using previously described pa-rameters (24). Using 1 Nonel of the first-strand synthesis reaction mixture as the template, the armH1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymer-ase (94\u00b0C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 4 min; final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min) and oligonucleotide primers cHalF1 and cHalR1 (Table 1). The PCR product was ligated into pGem-11Zf(None) via EcoRI and BamHI to yield the plasmid pMM1. After se-quencing, a correct clone was used as a template for a second PCR under the following conditions: Pfu polymerase and primers Hal1-28F and Hal1-28R for 25 cycles (94\u00b0C for 40 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 4 min, and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min). The resulting PCR product was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the vector pET28a, yielding the plasmid pMM21. The armH2 cDNA was procured as described for armH1 but using primer Hal2R2 for first-strand synthesis and oligonucleotide prim-ers Hal2F1 and Hal2R1 for cDNA amplification (Table 1). The PCR prod-uct was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET28a to give pMM13. For first-strand synthesis of armH3 to armH5, total RNA was primed with oligo(dT)18 primers and reverse transcribed using RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo). One microliter of first-strand synthesized armH3 to armH5 cDNA was amplified in a Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) PCR using the recommended master mix from the manufacturer with a final MgCl2 concentration of 2.0 mM. PCRs for armH3 to armH5 were primed with oligonucleotide pairs oJT073/oHJ01, oJT040/oJT041, and oJT042/oJT043, respectively (Table 1), using the following thermal-cycling parameters: initial denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 30 s; 30 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C (armH3) or 70\u00b0C (armH4 and armH5) for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min; and a final extension for 5 min at 72\u00b0C. Amplicons of armH3 to armH5 were ligated initially to pJET1.2 using the CloneJet PCR cloning kit and subsequently cut and ligated into equally cut pET28b to produce T7 expression plasmids pHJ28 (into NdeI and BamHI sites; armH3), pHJ14 (into NdeI and HindIII sites; armH4), and pHJ05 (into NdeI and EcoRI sites; armH5). The presence of insert integration was verified by DNA sequencing, and all molecular cloning was done in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue, selected by carbenicillin (pJET1.2) or kanamycin (pET28b). Cloning of the E. coli flavine reductase gene fre. The flavine reductase gene (fre) was amplified by PCR from genomic E. coli DNA using Pfu polymerase and primers FreN-F and FreN-R (Table 1) (30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 57\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 4 min and final extension of 72\u00b0C for 5 min). The PCR product was cloned into the NdeI and BglII sites of vector pET15b to yield plasmid pMM14. Heterologous protein production and purification. For production of ArmH1 to ArmH5, E. coli KRX was individually transformed with pMM21 (to express armH1), pMM13 (armH2), pHJ28 (armH3), pHJ14 (armH4), or pHJ05 (armH5). Each transformed E. coli strain was grown in 2None yeast extract-tryptone (YT) medium (supplemented with kanamycin [50 Noneg/ml]) in Erlenmeyer flasks (10 400-ml flasks) at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.4.

After an additional 18 h of shaking at 16\u00b0C, the cells were har-vested by centrifugation, cooled to 4\u00b0C, and lysed by sonication (3 times for 10 s each time). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with 2 ml (each) of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The resins were transferred onto gravity flow columns and washed with 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4; 300 mM NaCl) containing increasing imidazole concentrations (10 mM and 20 mM). Elution was performed with 2.5 ml of 400 mM imidazole. The enzymes were rebuffered in 3.5 ml phosphate buffer (100 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare). For bro-mination and iodination assays, NaCl was replaced with KBr or KI, re-spectively. The enzymes were concentrated with a 50-kDa-cutoff Amicon filter (Merck Millipore) and used for subsequent in vitro product forma-tion assays. To produce flavin reductase, E. coli BL21 transformed with pMM14 was grown in liquid LB medium containing 50 Noneg/ml carbenicil-lin at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm to an OD600 of 0.5 and then induced with IPTG (isopropyl-None-D-thiogalactopyranoside) (1 mM).

        "In vitro halogenation assays. Freshly prepared ArmH enzymes were separately incubated at 25\u00b0C overnight in a total volume of 100 Nonel. The buffer was 100 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl (or KBr or KI, respectively), pH 7.4. The reaction mixture also contained 2 mM NADH, 10 NoneM flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), 2.4 units E. coli flavin reductase (Fre) to supply the respective halogenase with FADH2, and the acceptor substrate (25 NoneM melleolide F). Fre activity was determined by following a pub-lished procedure (25). Reactions with heat-inactivated enzyme (95\u00b0C for 10 min) were run in parallel as negative controls, in particular to exclude nonenzymatic chlorination by hypochlorite that might have formed spontaneously in the assays. To prepare the reaction mixtures for chro-matography, they were extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate plus 1% acetic acid (vol/vol), dried under reduced pressure, and redissolved in 100 Nonel of methanol.",
        "Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In vitro reactions were analyzed on an Agilent 1200 high-performance liquid chromato-graph (HPLC) equipped with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (150 by 4.6 mm; 3.5-Nonem particle size). Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetate in H2O, and solvent B was acetonitrile. For melleolide analysis, a linear gra-dient from 50% B to 100% B within 16 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min was applied, followed by a wash step (100% B) for 5 min.

Diode array detection was from a None of 200 to 500 nm, and chromatograms were extracted at a None of 254 nm. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESIMS) was performed on a Thermo Accela liquid chromatograph equipped with a Betasil C18 column (150 by 2.1 mm; 3-Nonem particle size) and fitted to an Exactive Orbitrap mass spec-trometer (ThermoFisher). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in H2O, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. For sample analysis, the column was washed with 95% H2O for 1 min, followed by a linear gradi-ent (flow rate, 0.2 ml/min) from 5% B to 98% B within 15 min, and held at this relationship for 3 min. In silico sequence and phylogenetic analysis. To identify exon-intron junctions in silico, we used FGENESH (Softberry, Mount Kisco, NY) and Augustus (26) software as described previously (27). Primary sequences of FAD-dependent halogenases were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm (28) implemented as a plug-in for Geneious 7.1 (Biomatters Ltd., Auck-land, New Zealand). The alignment was exported and used to construct a phylogenetic network based on the neighbor net method implemented in the SplitsTree4 program (29). For the construction of a phylogenetic tree, the alignment was exported to MEGA6 (30). Based on a neighbor-joining tree, the optimal model of evolution was determined to be the Le-Gascuel (LG) model (31). A maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis was run using the LG model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. A FAD-dependent p-hydroxy-benzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) (Molecular Modeling Database [MMDB] accession no. 57109) from Pseudomonas fluorescens was used as the out-group to root the tree. The GenBank accession numbers of all proteins are compiled in Table S1 in the supplemental material. For phylogenetic anal-ysis, the sequences of the tryptophan halogenases RebH (32), PrnA (33), and PyrH (34) were used, all of them acting on free precursor molecules. We also included SgcC3, involved in halogenation of the enediyne anti-tumor substance C-1027 (17), BhaA from balhimycin biosynthesis (35), and PltA from pyoluteorin biosynthesis (36). All of the last four enzymes have been shown experimentally to depend on carrier-protein-bound in-termediates. The halogenase CndH (37) was suggested to interact with a carrier protein, as well, although direct evidence was not provided. AviH from Streptomyces viridochromogenes was included, as it chlorinates an orsellinic acid moiety at two positions during avilamycin biosynthesis (38), as well as the halogenase CalO3, which transfers iodine to orsellinic acid (19). Along with the five A. mellea halogenases, we included unchar-acterized basidiomycete halogenases of Heterobasidion irregulare (39) and Serpula lacrymans (40) and characterized halogenases from ascomycetes to the phylogenetic analysis. From the latter group of fungi, we added Rdc2 (41) and RadH (16), both involved in radicicol biosynthesis, as well as Gsfl of Penicillium aethiopicum, which is encoded in the griseofulvin gene cluster (18); PtaM from pestheic acid biosynthesis in Pestalotiopsis fici (42); GedL from the geodin pathway in Aspergillus terreus (43); and AclH from the aspirochlorine pathway in Aspergillus oryzae (44). To root the tree, we used the FAD-dependent PHBH of P. fluorescens (45) as the outgroup. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The DNA sequences of armH3 to armH5 were deposited in GenBank under the accession num-bers KT819179 to KT819181, respectively. RESULTS The melleolide gene cluster lacks a halogenase gene. In order to study the genetic basis underlying melleolide biosynthesis, we first searched the genomic sequence of A. mellea DSM3731 (13) using the primary sequences of the protoilludene cyclase Pro1 and the polyketide synthase ArmB (11, 12). Notably, the query sequences hit loci that were separated by only nine genes. The result pointed to a clustered arrangement of melleolide biosynthesis genes. This putative gene cluster includes five genes coding for P450-depen-dent monooxygenases (Fig. 2A, proteins 476 and 479 to 482), four NADNone-dependent oxidoreductases (proteins 468, 469, 474, and",

The P450-dependent en-zymes may be involved in protoilludene hydroxylation to elabo-rate melleolides with multiple alcohol groups, such as melleolide D (3), which carries alcohol functionalities at C-4, C-5, C-10, and C-13. The role of the NADNone-dependent enzymes remains un-known. Numerous melleolides, e.g., arnamial (6), show 5=-O-methylation of the aromatic moiety. This methylation step may be catalyzed by the methyltransferase encoded in the cluster. Search-ing for a halogenase, a potential candidate encoded in the cluster is the flavin-dependent oxidoreductase (protein 475). However, it lacks the strongly conserved motif GWXWXXPL (34) of FAD-dependent halogenases and showed homology to glucose-meth-anol-choline oxidoreductase instead. Thus, we hypothesized that protein 475 does not possess halogenase activity but might repre-sent the dehydrogenase yielding the aldehyde in position 1 of ar-namial and other melleolides. In turn, this suggested that the ha-logenase required for melleolide chlorination is not encoded in the gene cluster.",
        "Identification of halogenase genes in the A. mellea genome. Prior to the release of the A. mellea genomic sequence, we identi-fied the sequences of armH1 and armH2 (GenBank accession no. JF739169 and JF739170), i.e., two genes coding for putative flavin-dependent halogenases. These two genes are located on a contig-uous 71.5-kb portion of the A. mellea genome (22) that is not part of the melleolide biosynthesis gene cluster. By searching the genomic sequence, we have now identified three additional puta-tive halogenase genes, here referred to as armH3, armH4, and armH5 (GenBank accession no. KT819179 through KT819181), which are located neither within nor near the melleolide gene locus nor close to armH1 and armH2. For all five halogenase genes (armH1 to armH5), cDNA was successfully procured from myce-lium, confirming they are actively transcribed genes. Another two gene models encoding putative halogenases were incomplete, with missing portions across the respective genes, which is why we as-sume misassembled sequence data or pseudogenes.",

Melleolide F (Fig. 1) (46) is a typical representative of the melleolide family of compounds that features a None2,3-protoilludene terpene and an un-modified orsellinic acid moiety. Melleolide F can be procured from mycelial cultures in sufficient quantity and was used as a potential chlorine acceptor substrate in this study. Product formation was investigated by HPLC and HR-ESIMS. When given free melleolide F as the substrate, product formation could be proven in the chromatograms for all five ArmH enzymes by HPLC analysis. In addition to the melleolide F peak at a reten-tion time (tR) of 10.8 min, formation of a chlorinated product was chromatographically verified at a tR of 11.6 min (Fig. 4A to E). In the high-resolution mass spectra for ArmH1 to ArmH5 reac-tions, the new peaks corresponded to the mass of 6=-chloro-melleolide F (Table 3) and displayed the typical pattern for isotopic abundance of the stable chlorine isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl. Based on the areas under the curve, product formation was most pronounced with ArmH4. Bromination by ArmH4. We selected ArmH4 as a model to gain insight into the biosynthetic capacities of A. mellea haloge-nases.

        "Functional categories are not applicable to fungal haloge-nases. It has previously been suggested that halogenases can be grouped according to their substrate requirements (37). Group A",
        "includes enzymes that act on free substrates, while group B re-quires carrier-bound substrates for catalytic turnover. The au-thors differentiate these two groups by a phenylalanine residue (Phe312 in CndH, group B), which is equivalent to a glutamate residue (Glu346 in PrnA) in group A enzymes. According to these categories, all A. mellea halogenases would fall into group B of carrier-protein-dependent halogenases, as they show a phenyl-alanine residue (positions 326, 326, 327, 335, and 326 in ArmH1 to ArmH5, respectively). However, our results clearly prove that all of the above-mentioned halogenases act on free substrates and that the halogen-carbon bond is established as a post-PKS-biosyn-thetic step. This is in agreement with a previous study on the ascomycetous Rdc2 (41), which was shown to chlorinate a free substrate in vitro but has a phenylalanine at position 328. We therefore assume that this signature residue\u2014 discovered with bacterial enzymes\u2014is not applicable to differentiate halogenases of basidiomycete origin. To gain more insight into the evolution of FAD-dependent halogenases, we constructed a phylogenetic network (Fig. 5) and an ML tree (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) of experimentally characterized FAD-dependent halogenases and some putative halogenases encoded in genomes of basidiomy-cetes. The resulting network and tree suggested that fungal halogenases form a monophyletic clade. Thus, our phyloge-netic analyses support the notion that categorization into group A or B is not applicable to fungal enzymes. We found that the fungal halogenase tree reflects the phylogenetic split",

Protein crystallography greatly helped in understanding the structural basis of regioselective formation of the carbon-halogen bond (50\u201353). A. mellea halogenase genes encode the signature motif GW(A/V)W(F/L)I. In the three-dimensional protein structure, these residues line a tunnel inside the enzyme through which the hypochloric acid is routed from the flavin toward the halogen acceptor substrate binding site (50). Also, the active-site lysine was found in all A. mellea halogenases (K77 in ArmH5 and K76 in all the others).",
        "Based on the crystal structure of the chondromycin halogenase CndH (37), it has previously been suggested that flavin-dependent halogenases fall into two functionally dissimilar groups accepting free substrates (group A) or carrier-protein-bound substrates (group B). Although all the halogenases investigated in this study, as well as Rdc2 from Pochonia chlamydosporia, seem to accept free substrates, there are not enough data yet to assume that this is a general trait of fungal halogenases. However, rules deduced from bacterial sequences to predict their placement in either functional group are not appropriate for fungal halogenases. Alternatively, categorization of enzymes by activity on free versus enzyme-teth-ered substrates may not be as critical as previously assumed to draw a demarcation line between groups A and B. The type of substrate (tryptophan versus others) also seems to play a role, which would explain the major split (seen in Fig. S1 in the supple-mental material) between bacterial clade 1 and all other haloge-nases. Therefore, further biochemical studies are necessary to shed more light on this fascinating enzyme family, in particular as members of basidiomycete origin have remained completely uninvestigated, even though aromatic haloorganic natural products are known from these fungi. Besides the melleolides, examples include the alcalinaphenols from Mycena alcalina (54) and stephanosporin of Stephanospora caroticolor (55). Hence, our work represents the first biochemically and genetically character-ized basidiomycete halogenases. Phylogenetically, our work also revealed that ArmH1 to ArmH3 have most likely evolved by gene duplication within the A. mellea lineage and that ArmH4 and ArmH5 seem to have distinct phylogenetic histories. However, it is premature to speculate if any functional clusters within the fun-gal clades can be deduced from the phylogenetic tree. Again, more biochemical studies are warranted to improve functional pre-dictions of putative halogenases unveiled by high-throughput-sequencing projects. In various cases, e.g., for the antibiotic vancomycin and the antitumor agent salinosporamide, increased bioactivity has been attributed to the presence of halogen atoms (47). However, in the case of the melleolides, the physiological reason for introducing a chlorine atom is unclear. Available stud-ies on structure-activity relationships do not support strongly changed bioactivity through chlorination (8, 9, 20). Hence, a role in detoxification of melleolides through halogenation also can-not be assumed, and the reason why A. mellea secures chlorina-tion of its toxic natural products to the degree described here remains elusive. Although redundantly encoded pathways are known from both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (56\u201358), a 5-fold parallelized biosynthetic step is unprecedented and war-rants further investigation of the underlying ecological or envi-ronmental reason.",
