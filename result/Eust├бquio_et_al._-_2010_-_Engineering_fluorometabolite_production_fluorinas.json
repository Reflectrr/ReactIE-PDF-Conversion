While natural products are valuablesources of new chemical entities, natural fluorinated molecules are extremely rare and thepharmaceutical industry has not benefited from a microbial source of this class of compounds.Streptomyces cattleya is an unusual bacterium in that it elaborates fluoroacetate and the amino acid4-fluorothreonine. The discovery in 2002 of the fluorination enzyme FlA responsible for C-F bondformation in S. cattleya, and its subsequent characterization, opened up for the first time the prospectof genetically engineering fluorometabolite production from fluoride ion in host organisms. As aproof of principle, we report here the induced production of fluorosalinosporamide by replacing thechlorinase gene salL from Salinispora tropica with the fluorinase gene flA.Fluorinated natural products are extremely rare, with only a handful of such metabolitesidentified. Fluoroacetate is the most common, found in a variety of plants, however despite anincreased sophistication in high throughput screening technology and analytical methodsaimed at natural product identification, it is over 20 years since the last fluorinated microbialproducts were identified. These were fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine from the soilbacterium Streptomyces cattleya.1 This is in stark contrast to metabolites containing the otherhalogens.2,3 While numerous biochemical methods have evolved for the activation andincorporation of inorganic chloride, bromide, and iodide into organo-halo compounds, theunique physical properties of fluoride prevent oxidative activation to F+. Fluoride ion is alsoa poor nucleophile in water. The process of enzymatic fluorination in S. cattleya has beencharacterized and it has been shown that fluoride ion acts as a nucleophile and reacts with S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to generate the C\u2013F bond in 5\u2032-fluorodeoxyadenosine (5\u2032-FDA).5\u2032-FDA is subsequently metabolized into the mammalian toxin fluoroacetate and the antibiotic4-fluorothreonine (Figure 1).4,5 We now report the first example whereby the fluorinase genehas been incorporated into a host organism by genetic engineering, such that the heterologoushost has a new capacity to generate a fluorinated natural product when grown in the presenceof inorganic fluoride.\u2020Dedicated to the late Richard E.

To circumvent these problems, precursor-directed biosynthesis andmutasynthesis have contributed to the generation of a host of fluorinated natural productderivatives in which simple, synthetic organofluorine precursors are metabolized into morecomplex biosynthetic products.8 The discovery of fluorinase (5\u2032-FDA synthase) and thecharacterization of its initiating role in the biosynthesis of fluorinated metabolites in S.cattleya4,5 has provided an opportunity to reprogram biosynthesis in a heterologous host forthe assembly of an engineered organofluorine metabolite. We thus selected the marinebacterium Salinispora tropica as a suitable test organism since it uniquely biosynthesizes thepotent anticancer agent salinosporamide A from a related halogenation pathway involvingchlorine assimilation via 5\u2032-ClDA in a reaction catalyzed by the chlorinase SalL (Figure 1).9,10 Results and DiscussionWe previously prepared fluorosalinosporamide by a standard mutasynthesis approach in whichthe chlorinase gene salL was inactivated and the ensuing mutant was chemically complementedwith synthetic 5\u2032-FDA, 5-fluororibose11 or 4-fluorocrotonic acid.12 In order to engineerfluorosalinosporamide biosynthesis from inorganic fluoride, we generated a S. tropica mutantin which the salL chlorinase gene was chromosomally replaced with the S. cattleya flAfluorinase gene by \u03bb-Red mediated recombination13 so that flA was placed under the controlof the native salL promoter and ribosome binding site (Figure 2A). The correct genereplacement was confirmed by PCR (Figure 2B) and sequencing.Cultivation of the salL-flA+ mutant in seawater-based medium initially showed no detectablesalinosporamide A nor fluorosalinosporamide production (Figure 3) despite flA transcriptionbeing established in the mutant by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Figure 2C).Previously it was reported that fluorinase can also function as a chlorinase in vitro when coupledto a l-amino acid oxidase or to an adenylic acid deaminase in order to drive the equilibrium ofthe reaction towards chlorinated products.14 Although the rate of the reaction is at least twoorders of magnitude lower with chloride as a substrate compared to fluoride, we did expect atleast some salinosporamide A production in the mutant. Upon semi-purification of a large-scale fermentation extract followed by LC/APCI-MS analysis, we ultimately detectedsalinosporamide A. Yet, the amount produced (35 \u03bcg/L) was three orders of magnitude lowercompared to the wild-type S. tropica (50 mg/L), reflecting the differential specialization ofSalL and FlA as chlorinase and fluorinase, respectively.The inability to biosynthesize fluorosalinosporamide, on the other hand, was likely due to thelow concentration of fluoride in seawater (1.3 ppm). Cultivation of the S. tropica salL-flA+mutant in seawater-based medium supplemented with 2 mM potassium fluoride as reportedfor S. cattleya15 caused growth inhibition preventing the detection of fluorosalinosporamidein a timely manner. To circumvent the fluoride toxicity issue, potassium fluoride was not addeduntil the culture reached an early to mid exponential phase. Under these conditions,fluorosalinosporamide was clearly detectable in the culture broth by LC/(ESI)MS (Figure 3)and 19F-NMR (Figures 4 and 5).Fluoride uptake and fluorometabolite production by S. cattleya has been shown to be pH-dependent, with maximum rates at pH 6.0 and a sharp decline at higher and lower pH values.15 Likewise, maximum yields of fluorosalinosporamide production were detected at pH 6.0 (4mg/L), while lower pH values (5.5 was tested) inhibited growth, preventing fluorometaboliteEust\u00e1quio et al.Page 2J Nat Prod. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 March 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript production, and higher pH values (7-8) led to on average a 5-fold and 12-fold decrease in yields,respectively (Table 1).The fluorosalinosporamide production yields obtained at optimum pH were comparable tothose attained through mutasynthesis,11 which however was still one order of magnitude lowerthan the amount of salinosporamide A produced by the parent strain. In order to verify if therewere any significant competing pathways diverting fluorinated intermediates into other sideproducts, 19F-NMR analyses of the culture extracts were carried out. Figure 4 showsboth 19F{1H}-and 19F-spectra revealing that at least five fluorinated metabolites wereproduced. The major fluorinated component in the S. tropica salL-flA+ extract isfluorosalinosporamide (at -220.7 ppm), which was confirmed by NMR comparison to areference sample generated from previous mutasynthesis studies.11 In particular, the2D 1H/19F-HMBC experiment comparing the extract with a reference sample offluorosalinosporamide showed identical chemical shifts and correlations between 19F and 1Hsignals in the two samples (Figure 5).Although the structures of the other fluorinated compounds have not yet been elucidated, theminor metabolites corresponding to 19F-NMR signals at -217.5 ppm and -219.4 ppm have verysimilar 1H/19F-NMR coupling patterns as observed with fluorosalinosporamide (Figure 4).Hence they are most likely close structural analogs. Natural structural modifications reportedfor salinosporamide A include the C-2 epimer salinosporamide F, the C-3 ethyl derivativesalinosporamide I, the C-5 deoxy analog salinosporamide J, and the C-5 isopropyl derivativeantiprotealide.16-18 The presence of salinosporamide degradation products in culture extractshas also been described which include the hydrolyzed \u03b2-lactone and decarboxylated products.19,20 Because 19F-NMR analysis showed that fluorosalinosporamide is indeed the major fluorinatedmetabolite produced by S. tropica salL-flA+, an explanation for the lower yield offluorosalinosporamide produced by the mutant compared to salinosporamide A accumulatedby the wild-type is not consistent with parallel pathways diverting fluorinated intermediates.Rather fluoride toxicity and the differential preference for chlorinated versus fluorinatedsubstrates by downstream pathway enzymes in the salinosporamide biosynthetic pathwaylikely account for the observed disparate yields, especially considering that the mutasynthesisexperiment gave similar results.In conclusion, we have presented an example for the biosynthesis of fluorinated natural productanalogs from fluoride ion by introducing the fluorinase gene from S. cattleya into a suitableheterologous host. Broader applicability of fluorometabolite engineering in differentorganisms may come from the concomitant expression of other pathway enzymes involved inthe production of polyketide and/or non-ribosomal peptide building blocks such asfluoroacetyl-CoA, fluorothreonine or fluoroethylmalonyl-CoA.10,12,21,22Experimental SectionGeneral Experimental ProceduresSalinispora tropica CNB-44023 was cultured in A1 sea water-based medium as described.24The pH of the medium was set up using 50 mM MES buffer (pH 5.5 to 7.0) or phosphate buffer(pH 8.0). The REDIRECT technology kit for PCR targeting13 was obtained from PlantBioscience Limited (Norwich, UK). pCC1FOS-based (Epicentre) fosmid BHXS1782 wasobtained from the Joint Genome Institute. Apramycin (200 \u03bcg/mL for S. tropica; 50 \u03bcg/mLfor E. coli), chloramphenicol (12-25 \u03bcg/mL), carbenicillin (100 \u03bcg/mL), and nalidixic acid(100 \u03bcg/mL) were used for selection of recombinant strains. DNA manipulation and PCR wereEust\u00e1quio et al.Page 3J Nat Prod.

Primers used in PCR 1 were P1_flAki (GTC GGT TTCCGA CCG ATA AAA CGG AGG TCA CTC ACC ATG GCT GCC AAC AGC ACA CG)and P2_flAki (TT CGA ACT GCA GGT CGA CGG ATC CCC GGA AT GGT ACG TCGTCG CGC GTT C) and in PCR 2, P3_flAki (ATT CCG GGG ATC CGT CGA CC) andP4_flAki (GAC AGG AGC TAC CCA GCA GCA TGC CGC CCC CTG GGT CAG TGTAGG CTG GAG CTG CTT C) in which priming sites are underlined. PCR 1 was subject to30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C (30 s), 58 \u00b0C (45 s) and 72 \u00b0C (90 s) using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase(Stratagene) and FlA_HT plasmid27 as template. PCR 2 was carried out using the High FidelityPCR system (Roche) as reported.13 PCR products were digested with DpnI to eliminatetemplate plasmid, purified using the QIAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and mixed toapproximately equimolar concentrations for the second round which was carried out using theHigh Fidelity PCR system (Roche) and primers P1_flAki and P4_flAki. Cycle conditionsconsisted of 1 cycle of 94 \u00b0C (2 min), followed by a cycle of 94 \u00b0C (45 s) and 72 \u00b0C (5 min),10 cycles of 94 \u00b0C (45 s), 60 \u00b0C (45 s), 72 \u00b0C (2.5 min), 15 cycles of 94 \u00b0C (45 s), 65 \u00b0C (45s), 72 \u00b0C (2.5 min) and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C (10 min). The desired fragment was thengel purified using the QIAQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and used for replacement ofsalL in fosmid BHXS1782 by PCR targeting as previously described.9,13 Gene replacementin the fosmid was confirmed by PCR and sequencing using primers PflAseq_f (GAG AAGCCT GCG GTT CGT G) and (PflAseq_r GA ACT GCA GGT CGA CGG ATC). S. tropicamutants were confirmed by PCR.RT-PCR analysisRNA was isolated from cells collected from a second generation S. tropica A1 liquid culturegrown for 67 h (late exponential phase) using the RiboPure-Bacteria kit (Ambion). cDNA wassynthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen)as previously described.10 Primers used in the PCR step to interrogate flA transcription werePflArt_f (GAG ATC GTC CGC TTC AAC C) and PflArt_r (TGA GGT AGA TGG CGA TGTTG). Absence of genomic DNA contamination in the RNA samples and cDNA quality wereassessed using 16S rRNA primers.10Analysis of fluorosalinosporamide productionBest yields of fluorosalinosporamide production were obtained by culturing the S. tropicasalL-flA+ mutant in A1 pH 6.0 for two days (early exponential phase) before adding 2 mM ofpotassium fluoride. XAD 7 resin (Sigma) was added at the time of fluoride supplementationand extracted with acetone after two weeks. The dried extract was then subject to EtOAc-H2O partition and the organic phase analyzed by HPLC with a Phenomenex C18 column (150\u00d7 4.6 mm; 5 \u03bcm particle size) at flow rate of 0.7 mL min-1, using MeCN (B) in H2O (A) asmobile phase (0 to 30% B in 5 min, then 30% B for 20 min, 30 to 35% B in 5 min, 35% B for8 min, 35 to 100% B in 5 min, 100% B for 5 min) and monitoring at 210 nm.Fluorosalinosporamide identity was confirmed with an authentic standard by LC/(+)ESI-MS([M+H]+: m/z 298).11Eust\u00e1quio et al.Page 4J Nat Prod.

Fractions containing salinosporamides(eluted at 90:10, CH2Cl2:acetone) were combined, dried in vacuo and analyzed by LC/(APCI)-MS using a Michrom Magic C-18 column (150 \u00d7 1.0 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size, 200\u00c5 pore size)and a gradient of 7.5 to 97.5% MeCN in H2O (50 \u03bcL/min flow rate) as mobile phase(salinosporamide A retention time of 18.5 min, m/z 314 and 316, 3:1, [M+H]+).19F-NMR analysisThe dried acetone extracts of S. tropica salL-flA+ were resuspended directly in CDCl3and 19F-NMR (and HMBC) spectra were run on a Bruker AV-500MHz instrument (19F at470.33 MHz). 19F-NMR spectra were recorded with and without proton decoupling. 19F-NMRchemical shifts were calculated relative to CFCl3. Figure 6 shows that the experimental 19F-NMR fluorosalinosporamide spectrum matches well a DAISY simulation28 of the spectrum(-220.7 ppm; 2JH, F= 47.0 Hz, 2 equivalent H, and 3JH, F = 28.8 and 24.3 Hz, 2 non-equivalentdiastereotopic H).Acknowledgments We kindly thank W.

As aproof of principle, we report here the induced production of fluorosalinosporamide by replacing thechlorinase gene salL from Salinispora tropica with the fluorinase gene",
        "flA.Fluorinated natural products are extremely rare, with only a handful of such metabolitesidentified. Fluoroacetate is the most common, found in a variety of plants, however despite anincreased sophistication in high throughput screening technology and analytical methodsaimed at natural product identification, it is over 20 years since the last fluorinated microbialproducts were identified. These were fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine from the soilbacterium Streptomyces cattleya.1 This is in stark contrast to metabolites containing the otherhalogens.2,3 While numerous biochemical methods have evolved for the activation andincorporation of inorganic chloride, bromide, and iodide into organo-halo compounds, theunique physical properties of fluoride prevent oxidative activation to F+. Fluoride ion is alsoa poor nucleophile in water. The process of enzymatic fluorination in S. cattleya has beencharacterized and it has been shown that fluoride ion acts as a nucleophile and reacts with S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to generate the C\u2013F bond in 5\u2032-fluorodeoxyadenosine (5\u2032-FDA).5\u2032-FDA is subsequently metabolized into the mammalian toxin fluoroacetate and the antibiotic4-fluorothreonine (Figure 1).4,5 We now report the first example whereby the fluorinase genehas been incorporated into a host organism by genetic engineering, such that the heterologoushost has a new capacity to generate a fluorinated natural product when grown in the presenceof inorganic",

        "Organofluorine compounds represent an important class of drugs in which the halogen canimpart favorable pharmacokinetic properties.6,7 While fluorinated molecules are routinelysynthesized in the laboratory, the incorporation of fluorine into structurally complex naturalproducts can prove problematic, as most fluorination reagents are non-selective, often noxiousand difficult to handle. To circumvent these problems, precursor-directed biosynthesis andmutasynthesis have contributed to the generation of a host of fluorinated natural productderivatives in which simple, synthetic organofluorine precursors are metabolized into morecomplex biosynthetic products.8 The discovery of fluorinase (5\u2032-FDA synthase) and thecharacterization of its initiating role in the biosynthesis of fluorinated metabolites in S.cattleya4,5 has provided an opportunity to reprogram biosynthesis in a heterologous host forthe assembly of an engineered organofluorine metabolite. We thus selected the marinebacterium Salinispora tropica as a suitable test organism since it uniquely biosynthesizes thepotent anticancer agent salinosporamide A from a related halogenation pathway involvingchlorine assimilation via 5\u2032-ClDA in a reaction catalyzed by the chlorinase SalL (Figure 1).9,10",
        "Results and",
        "DiscussionWe previously prepared fluorosalinosporamide by a standard mutasynthesis approach in whichthe chlorinase gene salL was inactivated and the ensuing mutant was chemically complementedwith synthetic 5\u2032-FDA, 5-fluororibose11 or 4-fluorocrotonic acid.12 In order to engineerfluorosalinosporamide biosynthesis from inorganic fluoride, we generated a S. tropica mutantin which the salL chlorinase gene was chromosomally replaced with the S. cattleya flAfluorinase gene by \u03bb-Red mediated recombination13 so that flA was placed under the controlof the native salL promoter and ribosome binding site (Figure 2A). The correct genereplacement was confirmed by PCR (Figure 2B) and",
        "sequencing.Cultivation of the salL-flA+ mutant in seawater-based medium initially showed no detectablesalinosporamide A nor fluorosalinosporamide production (Figure 3) despite flA transcriptionbeing established in the mutant by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Figure 2C).Previously it was reported that fluorinase can also function as a chlorinase in vitro when coupledto a l-amino acid oxidase or to an adenylic acid deaminase in order to drive the equilibrium ofthe reaction towards chlorinated products.14 Although the rate of the reaction is at least twoorders of magnitude lower with chloride as a substrate compared to fluoride, we did expect atleast some salinosporamide A production in the mutant. Upon semi-purification of a large-scale fermentation extract followed by LC/APCI-MS analysis, we ultimately detectedsalinosporamide A. Yet, the amount produced (35 \u03bcg/L) was three orders of magnitude lowercompared to the wild-type S. tropica (50 mg/L), reflecting the differential specialization ofSalL and FlA as chlorinase and fluorinase,",
        "respectively.The inability to biosynthesize fluorosalinosporamide, on the other hand, was likely due to thelow concentration of fluoride in seawater (1.3 ppm). Cultivation of the S. tropica salL-flA+mutant in seawater-based medium supplemented with 2 mM potassium fluoride as reportedfor S. cattleya15 caused growth inhibition preventing the detection of fluorosalinosporamidein a timely manner. To circumvent the fluoride toxicity issue, potassium fluoride was not addeduntil the culture reached an early to mid exponential phase. Under these conditions,fluorosalinosporamide was clearly detectable in the culture broth by LC/(ESI)MS (Figure 3)and 19F-NMR (Figures 4 and",
        "5).Fluoride uptake and fluorometabolite production by S. cattleya has been shown to be pH-dependent, with maximum rates at pH 6.0 and a sharp decline at higher and lower pH values.15 Likewise, maximum yields of fluorosalinosporamide production were detected at pH 6.0 (4mg/L), while lower pH values (5.5 was tested) inhibited growth, preventing",

        "production, and higher pH values (7-8) led to on average a 5-fold and 12-fold decrease in yields,respectively (Table",
        "1).The fluorosalinosporamide production yields obtained at optimum pH were comparable tothose attained through mutasynthesis,11 which however was still one order of magnitude lowerthan the amount of salinosporamide A produced by the parent strain. In order to verify if therewere any significant competing pathways diverting fluorinated intermediates into other sideproducts, 19F-NMR analyses of the culture extracts were carried out. Figure 4 showsboth 19F{1H}-and 19F-spectra revealing that at least five fluorinated metabolites wereproduced. The major fluorinated component in the S. tropica salL-flA+ extract isfluorosalinosporamide (at -220.7 ppm), which was confirmed by NMR comparison to areference sample generated from previous mutasynthesis studies.11 In particular, the2D 1H/19F-HMBC experiment comparing the extract with a reference sample offluorosalinosporamide showed identical chemical shifts and correlations between 19F and 1Hsignals in the two samples (Figure",
        "5).Although the structures of the other fluorinated compounds have not yet been elucidated, theminor metabolites corresponding to 19F-NMR signals at -217.5 ppm and -219.4 ppm have verysimilar 1H/19F-NMR coupling patterns as observed with fluorosalinosporamide (Figure 4).Hence they are most likely close structural analogs. Natural structural modifications reportedfor salinosporamide A include the C-2 epimer salinosporamide F, the C-3 ethyl derivativesalinosporamide I, the C-5 deoxy analog salinosporamide J, and the C-5 isopropyl derivativeantiprotealide.16-18 The presence of salinosporamide degradation products in culture extractshas also been described which include the hydrolyzed \u03b2-lactone and decarboxylated products.19,20",
        "Because 19F-NMR analysis showed that fluorosalinosporamide is indeed the major fluorinatedmetabolite produced by S. tropica salL-flA+, an explanation for the lower yield offluorosalinosporamide produced by the mutant compared to salinosporamide A accumulatedby the wild-type is not consistent with parallel pathways diverting fluorinated intermediates.Rather fluoride toxicity and the differential preference for chlorinated versus fluorinatedsubstrates by downstream pathway enzymes in the salinosporamide biosynthetic pathwaylikely account for the observed disparate yields, especially considering that the mutasynthesisexperiment gave similar",
        "results.In conclusion, we have presented an example for the biosynthesis of fluorinated natural productanalogs from fluoride ion by introducing the fluorinase gene from S. cattleya into a suitableheterologous host. Broader applicability of fluorometabolite engineering in differentorganisms may come from the concomitant expression of other pathway enzymes involved inthe production of polyketide and/or non-ribosomal peptide building blocks such asfluoroacetyl-CoA, fluorothreonine or",
