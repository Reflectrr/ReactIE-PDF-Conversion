The indole ring is probably derived from tryptophan, and thus primers derived from conserved regions of trypto-phan halogenases were used to amplify and clone a DNA fragment that was then used to isolate a trypto-phan 5-halogenase gene (pyrH) from a cosmid library of the pyrroindomycin producer Streptomyces ru-gosporus LL-42D005. A gene disruption mutant in the tryptophan 5-halogenase gene no longer produced pyrroindomycin B, but still produced pyrroindomycin A, the nonhalogenated derivative. The halogenase gene could be overexpressed in Pseudomonas fluo-rescens BL915 NoneORF1 and was purified to homo-geneity by immobilized metal chelate ion affinity chromatography. Chlorinating and brominating activi-ties with tryptophan as a substrate were detected in cell-free extracts and for the purified enzyme. Introduction The pyrroindomycins A and B (Figure 1) were isolated by Ding et al. in 1994 [1]. Pyrroindomycin A and B ex-hibit good to excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphy-lococcus aureus strains and poor activity against gram-negative bacteria, with pyrroindomycin A show-ing a higher antibacterial activity than the chlorinated derivative pyrroindomycin B [2]. The pyrroindomycins are composed of a pyrroloindole entity linked via an ester bond to an unbranched deoxytrisaccharide.

Whereas pyrroindomycin B contains a chlorine atom, pyrroindo-mycin A is the nonhalogenated derivative. Tryptophan is presumed to be the precursor for the pyrroloindole moiety [3]. The first step in the biosynthesis of the anti-fungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin is the regioselective chlori-nation of tryptophan in the 7 position [4]. This is also assumed for the antitumor compound rebeccamycin [5]. Genes coding for enzymes catalyzing the regiose-lective chlorination of tryptophan in the 7 position have been isolated from several pyrrolnitrin-producing bac-teria [6, 7]. Purification and characterization of the cor-responding enzyme showed that it belongs to a novel type of halogenating enzymes. These halogenases are part of a two component system consisting of a flavin reductase and the actual halogenase. The flavin reduc-tase is required for the formation of FADH2 from FAD and NADH [8]. From the rebeccamycin producer Leche-valieria aerocolonigenes, a gene with high similarity to the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene from the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated [5], supporting the assumption that in rebeccamycin biosynthesis tryp-tophan is also halogenated in the 7 position. If the pre-sumption that in the biosynthesis of pyrroindomycin B chlorination of tryptophan should take place was cor-rect, it should be possible to detect the gene of this tryptophan 5-halogenase by PCR using primers derived from conserved regions of the tryptophan 7-halo-genase genes isolated so far. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of the tryptophan 7-halo-genases involved in pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis and the putative tryptophan 7-halogenase from the rebecca-mycin producer showed the presence of a few con-served regions suitable for the constructions of PCR primers. Here we report the cloning and expression of a tryptophan 5-halogenase gene, the purification of the enzyme in active form, the identification of the enzy-matic product, and the proof for the involvement of this tryptophan 5-halogenase in pyrroindomycin B biosyn-thesis. Results and Discussion Detection of the Tryptophan 5-Halogenase Gene Comparison of published amino acid sequences of tryptophan 7-halogenases from pyrrolnitrin-producing bacteria [7] and the putative tryptophan 7-halogenase involved in rebeccamycin biosynthesis in Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes [5] allowed the identification of four conserved regions (Figure 2) suitable for the construc-tion of four PCR primers. Using these primers in four combinations with total DNA from the pyrroindomycin producer Streptomyces rugosporus as the template DNA, a fragment of w700 bp (PCR-hal) could be ampli-fied with a combination of primers SZ003 and SZ005. Sequencing and analysis of the 700 bp PCR product shows an identity at the amino acid level to the trypto-phan halogenases used for the sequence alignment be-Chemistry & Biology 446 Figure 1.

Data from the HPLC-ESI-MS Characterization of the Pyrroindomycin Metabolites from Streptomyces rugosporus SZTF1Hal and the Chemistry & Biology 450 NoneTherefore, in order to prove the involvement of PyrH lin the biosynthesis of pyrroindomycin B, a gene disrup-ption mutant was constructed. For this purpose, plasmid i pSZ614 was generated. Plasmid pSZ614 containing the p pyrH gene disrupted by an apramycin resistance gene w s(Figure 5A) is a bifunctional mobilizable plasmid that is Nunstable in S. rugosporus. This plasmid was introduced pinto the wild-type strain S. rugosporus by conjugation from E. coli. This experiment resulted in the apramycin-Dresistant and thiostrepton-sensitive mutant SZTF1Hal, P where the mutated gene replaced the wild-type copy of k the chromosome via homologous recombination (Fig-t ure 5B). The recombination event was confirmed by [ aSouthern analysis of chromosomal DNA from mutant pSZTF1Hal and its comparison to the wild-type strain. w m Mass Spectrometric Characterization of the r (Biosynthetic Products of the Mutant SZTF1Hal STo identify the pyrroindomycins produced by mutant rSZTF1Hal, cell extracts of this strain were analyzed by a HPLC-ESI-MS. The mass spectra derived from these c investigations indicated the production of pyrroindo-d mycin A and methylated pyrroindomycin A, but not that p Iof pyrroindomycin B (Figure 6B). According to the char-Eacteristic isotopic pattern, the pyrroindomycin variants [synthesized by mutant strain SZTF1Hal did not contain C any chlorine atoms, as evident from the mass shifts of H 34 atomic mass units to lower masses in comparison to g the corresponding signals from the wild-type extracts (Figures 6A and 6B). P D gSignificance f k Regioselectively acting halogenases are enzymes c fthat are responsible for the biosynthesis of a large ovariety of halogenated secondary metabolites. In Gmany cases the biological activity of these metabo-Slites is significantly influenced by the halogen substit-S uents. Isolation and characterization of the genes of S specific halogenases and understanding the bio-m 1chemistry of these enzymes are prerequisites for ge-Dnetic engineering aiming at the production of novel dhalogenated compounds by combinatorial biosynthe-psis. In the work presented here, a halogenase with P novel regioselectivity was isolated. To our knowl-b edge, this enzyme is the first tryptophan 5-halo-genase and only the second halogenase purified in C active form, and one of only three specific halo-F tgenases for which the enzymatic activity and the in-tvolvement in the biosynthesis of a halogenated me-ttabolite could be shown. The availability of this e specific halogenase is expected to open up novel s possibilities for combinatorial biosynthesis and the p enzymatic production of halogenated compounds. t p SExperimental Procedures Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and Vectors G FStreptomyces rugosporus NRRL 21084 [1], Escherichia coli XL1 Blue MRA [Stratagene], E. coli JM109 (DE3) pEE1001 [14], and f BPseudomonas fluorescens BL915 NoneORF1 [6] were used in this work. For sporulation, S. rugosporus was routinely grown at 30\u00b0C t Ton agar plates containing MS medium for 7 days [15]. Cultures of S. rugosporus were grown on NZ Amine A medium [ATCC 172] at 30\u00b0C. E. coli was grown at 37\u00b0C in LB [16], supplemented with 100 g ml-1 apramycin, 15 Noneg ml-1 tetracycline, or 100 Noneg ml-1 ampicil-in. P. fluorescens strains were grown at 30\u00b0C on modified LB sup-lemented with 50 Noneg ml-1 kanamycin and 30 Noneg ml-1 tetracycline, f necessary, for 2 days. Vectors pOJ446 [17], pEFBA [18], and HZ1358 [19] were described previously, and pBluescript II SK (+) as from a commercial source [Stratagene]. pCIBhis was con-tructed through cloning of a 270 bp PCR-fragment from the -terminal expression region of pRSETB [Stratagene] including the olyhistidine tag and the MCS into the BamHI site of pPEH14 [4]. NA Manipulation and Sequencing lasmid DNA preparations, restriction endonuclease digestions, al-aline phosphatase treatments, ligations, and other DNA manipula-ions were performed according to standard procedures for E. coli 16]. A genomic library of S. rugosporus was constructed in pOJ446 ccording to published procedures [16] and packaged with Giga-ack III XL extract from Stratagene. Total DNA of S. rugosporus as isolated after treatment of the cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr with 10 mg l-1 lysozyme in lysozyme buffer (10 mM Tris and 0.3 M saccha-ose [pH 8]). The cells were pelleted and resuspended in NAE buffer 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 M EDTA [pH 8]). Proteinase K solution and DS were added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg ml-1 and 2%, espectively. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for a further 3 hr nd at 60\u00b0C for an additional 30 min. DNA was purified by phenol/ hloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Southern analysis, igoxigenin labeling of probes, hybridization, and detection were erformed according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Roche). ntroduction of DNA into S. rugosporus was performed through . coli-Streptomyces conjugation routinely used for Streptomyces 20]. DNA sequencing was performed by MWG biotech Ebersberg. omputer assisted database searches were carried out using the USAR program package (EMBL Heidelberg) and the BLAST pro-ram [21]. CR Amplification egenerated oligonucleotides were designed to locate the halo-enase gene in total DNA of S. rugosporus. They were derived from our conserved motifs present in the amino acid sequences of nown tryptophan halogenase proteins (Figure 2). These oligonu-leotides were used to attempt PCR amplification using total DNA rom S. rugosporus as the template. The sequences of two sense ligonucleotides were SZ002 (motif II) 5#-TCGGYGTSGGCGARGC ACCRTCCC-3# and SZ003 (motif I) 5#-TSGGCGGCGGCACYGC GGMTGGATG-3# and those of the two antisense oligonucleotides Z004 (motif IV) 5#-AGCATSGGRATCTTCCAGGTCCABCC-3# and Z005 (motif III) 5#-GCCGGAGCAGTCGAYGAASAGGTC-3#. PCR ixtures contained 50 ng of template DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, mM MgCl2, 2.5 U Taq DNA Polymerase (MBI fermentas), 5% MSO, and 0.2 mM dNTP-mix. Amplification was obtained by stan-ard procedure with an annealing temperature of 63.5\u00b0C. The PCR roduct of the oligonucleotides SZ003 and SZ005 was named CR-hal and subsequently used as the DNA probe for Southern hy-ridization. onstruction of Plasmids rom cosmid 6D1, a 4300 kb BamHI fragment was subcloned into he BamHI site of pBluescript II SK (+) yielding pB1G that contained he entire halogenase gene. For disruption of the halogenase gene, he apramycin resistance gene from pEFBA was cloned blunt-nded as a 1.5 kb HindIII-NdeI fragment into the blunt-ended PaeI ite internal in the halogenase gene of pB1G leading to the plasmid SZ594. The 5.8 kb BamHI fragment from pSZ594 was cloned into he same site of pHZ1358 yielding pSZ614 (Figure 5A). Plasmid SZ614 was used for disruption of the chromosomal pyrH gene in . rugosporus (Figure 5B). ene Expression or the expression of pyrH in P. fluorescens, the gene was ampli-ied by PCR. The following primers were used (restriction sites for amHI and HindIII, respectively, are underlined and were included o facilitate ligation into pCIBhis): 5#-ATCGGGATCCCCATATGA CCGATCTGTGGTGATCGTGGGTG-3# for the 5# end of the halo-genase gene and 5#-ATGAAAGCTTTCATTGGATGCTGGCGAGGT ACTCGTAGCAGC-3# for the 3# end of the gene. PCR reaction con-Tryptophan 5-Halogenase 451 ditions were as follows: 100 ng of template DNA were mixed with 50 pmol of each primer, 1 mM MgSO4, and 2 U Pfu DNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 Nonel containing 2 mM of each dNTP and 10% DMSO. The reaction was performed under standard conditions with an annealing temperature of 68.1\u00b0C. The PCR product was purified, digested with BamHI and HindIII, and ligated into the same sites of pCIBhis, generating pSZexM2. The amplified DNA se-quence was verified by sequencing. The plasmid pSZexM2 was then introduced into P. fluorescens BL915 NoneORF1 by conjugation, as described earlier [22]. The halogenase gene was constitutively expressed in P. fluorescens under control of the tac promoter [4]. Preparation of Crude Extracts, Protein Electrophoresis, and Protein Measurements Cells from a 2-day-old culture of P. fluorescens BL915 NoneORF1 pSZexM2 and control strain (containing pCIBhis) were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with saline. The cells were re-suspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and disrupted by sonication for 6 min (Branson sonifier 450, 160 W, 60% amplitude, 4\u00b0C). The crude extract was obtained by centrifu-gation (two times at 22,100 g, 4\u00b0C, 30 min) and immediately dia-lyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Flavin reductase-containing extracts were prepared from E. coli JM109 (DE3) pEE1001 [14]. Cells from an overnight culture were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 10 mM potassium phos-phate buffer (pH 7.2). The cells were resuspended in 100 mM po-tassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and disrupted by sonication for 2.5 min. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the crude extract containing Fre was used for enzyme assays after di-alysis against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) con-taining 10% glycerol. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Sch\u00e4gger and von Jagow [23] using 4.5% stacking gels and 10% resolving gels. For the estimation of protein size, Mark12 MW stan-dard (Novex) was used. Gels were stained for proteins with Coo-massie Brillant Blue R250. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Whitaker and Granum [24]. Enzyme Assay Halogenating activity was determined after incubating 100 Nonel of crude extract from P. fluorescens BL915 NoneORF1 pSZexM2 contain-ing recombinant tryptophan 5-halogenase or 100 Nonel of purified PyrH, respectively, with 4.5 mU Fre [25], 10 NoneM FAD, 2.4 mM NADH, 25 mM NaCl or NaBr, respectively, 0.6 mM L-tryptophan, and 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) in a total volume of 200 Nonel at 30\u00b0C for 6 hr (crude extract) and for 90 min (purified PyrH), respectively. The reaction was stopped by boiling in a water bath for 5 min. After removal of precipitated protein by centrifugation, 20 Nonel of the assay mixture was analyzed by HPLC. HPLC was per-formed on a Nucleosil 100 RP-18 column (5Nonem, 125 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, Bischoff) with MeOH/H2O/trifluoracetic acid (40:60:0.1) as the eluent with a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 and UV detection at 220 nm The products were identified by comparison of their retention times with reference substances, HPLC-UV spectra, and HPLC-ESI-MS. Purification of PyrH All purification steps were performed at 4\u00b0C. For purification, the cell-free extract was dialyzed overnight against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and loaded onto a nickel-chelating sepharose fast flow column (44 ml column volume). The column was washed with buffer A (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 7.2] and 0.15 M NaCl) until the absorbance at 280 nm remained constant. After a further washing step with 180 ml of 40% buffer B (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 7.2], 150 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole), PyrH was eluted with 100% buffer B. Fractions (2 ml) containing PyrH, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol. The purified enzyme was stored at -20\u00b0C. 1H NMR Analysis of 5-Chlorotryptophan A large-scale reaction (6 \u00d7 3 ml) containing 10 mM potassium phos-phate buffer [pH 7.2], 5 NoneM FAD, 25 mM NaCl, 0.6 mM L-trypto-phan, 1,560 U catalase, 5 mM NADH, 169 mU flavin reductase (Fre), and 1.5 ml of cell-free crude extract was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min with shaking (150 rpm). The assay mixtures were heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min and protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was fractionated by preparative HPLC using a Eu-rosphere-100 RP-18 column (5 Nonem, 250 mm \u00d7 20 mm, Knauer) with MeOH/H2O/ammonium acetate (40:60:0.1) as the eluent at a flow rate of 5 ml min-1. Fractions containing the chlorinated tryptophan derivative were pooled and methanol was evaporated in vacuo. The resulting aqueous solution was freeze dried. The remaining solid was dissolved in D2O and analyzed by 1H NMR. 1H NMR spectros-copy was performed in a Bruker NMR spectrometer DRX-500 sys-tem (TMS d = 0). Authentic 5-chlorotryptophan was purchased from Apin Chemicals Ltd. Isolation of Pyrroindomycins Spores of strains S. rugosporus NRRL 21084 and S. rugosporus SZTF1Hal were inoculated in NZ Amine A medium and cultivated at 30\u00b0C and 170 rpm for 3 days. Each seed culture was used to inoculate (2.5%, v/v) four Erlenmeyer flasks containing 250 ml of SO7 medium [3]. After incubation for 8 days under the same condi-tions, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Since the pyrroindo-mycins were found to be predominantly associated with the cell pellet, the cells were resuspended in a small volume of water and were twice extracted by shaking for 2 hr with 1.5 volumes of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was carefully removed and evaporated in vacuo. The dried extracts from the pellets of each strain were redissolved in 100 Nonel methanol and applied to HPLC analysis. HPLC and HPLC-ESI-MS Analysis Detection of tryptophan derivatives and pyrroindomycins was per-formed by HPLC (Knauer, Berlin, Germany) on a reversed phase column (Lichrosphere 100 RP-18, 5.0 Nonem 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, Bischoff), with acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water as eluent. A gradient from 10% to 100% acetonitrile over 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 was used. From each strain 20 Nonel of the extracts were injected. Detection and spectral characterization of peaks were performed with a photodiode array detector. Pyrroin-domycins were detected due to their characteristic UV/Vis spectra. The halogenation status of the compounds was monitored by HPLC-ESI-MS. For this purpose, cell-free extracts of the trypto-phan halogenation assay or crude methanol extracts of pyrroindo-mycins from cell extracts of wild-type and mutant strains were ana-lyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS. Separations were performed on a Merck Purospher column (RP-C18e, 125 \u00d7 4 mm, 4.0 Nonem) with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The UV detector (\u03bb = 214 nm) was connected in series with the mass spectrometer. Solvent A was 0.1% TFA and solvent B was acetonitrile/0.1%TFA (gradient 10%\u2013100% over 10 min). Injection volumes were 20 Nonel. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis was per-formed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent, Waldbronn, Ger-many) coupled to a Bruker Esquire 3000plus (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an ion-trap analyzer.

        "Summary",
        "The antibiotic compound pyrroindomycin B contains an indole ring chlorinated in the 5 position. The indole ring is probably derived from tryptophan, and thus primers derived from conserved regions of trypto-phan halogenases were used to amplify and clone a DNA fragment that was then used to isolate a trypto-phan 5-halogenase gene (pyrH) from a cosmid library of the pyrroindomycin producer Streptomyces ru-gosporus LL-42D005. A gene disruption mutant in the tryptophan 5-halogenase gene no longer produced pyrroindomycin B, but still produced pyrroindomycin A, the nonhalogenated derivative. The halogenase gene could be overexpressed in Pseudomonas fluo-rescens BL915 NoneORF1 and was purified to homo-geneity by immobilized metal chelate ion affinity chromatography. Chlorinating and brominating activi-ties with tryptophan as a substrate were detected in cell-free extracts and for the purified enzyme.",
        "Introduction",
        "The pyrroindomycins A and B (Figure 1) were isolated by Ding et al. in 1994 [1]. Pyrroindomycin A and B ex-hibit good to excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphy-lococcus aureus strains and poor activity against gram-negative bacteria, with pyrroindomycin A show-ing a higher antibacterial activity than the chlorinated derivative pyrroindomycin B [2]. The pyrroindomycins are composed of a pyrroloindole entity linked via an ester bond to an unbranched deoxytrisaccharide. A polyketide macro-ring system containing a tetramic",

Whereas pyrroindomycin B contains a chlorine atom, pyrroindo-mycin A is the nonhalogenated derivative. Tryptophan is presumed to be the precursor for the pyrroloindole moiety [3]. The first step in the biosynthesis of the anti-fungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin is the regioselective chlori-nation of tryptophan in the 7 position [4]. This is also assumed for the antitumor compound rebeccamycin [5]. Genes coding for enzymes catalyzing the regiose-lective chlorination of tryptophan in the 7 position have been isolated from several pyrrolnitrin-producing bac-teria [6, 7]. Purification and characterization of the cor-responding enzyme showed that it belongs to a novel type of halogenating enzymes. These halogenases are part of a two component system consisting of a flavin reductase and the actual halogenase. The flavin reduc-tase is required for the formation of FADH2 from FAD and NADH [8]. From the rebeccamycin producer Leche-valieria aerocolonigenes, a gene with high similarity to the tryptophan 7-halogenase gene from the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated [5], supporting the assumption that in rebeccamycin biosynthesis tryp-tophan is also halogenated in the 7 position. If the pre-sumption that in the biosynthesis of pyrroindomycin B chlorination of tryptophan should take place was cor-rect, it should be possible to detect the gene of this tryptophan 5-halogenase by PCR using primers derived from conserved regions of the tryptophan 7-halo-genase genes isolated so far. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of the tryptophan 7-halo-genases involved in pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis and the putative tryptophan 7-halogenase from the rebecca-mycin producer showed the presence of a few con-served regions suitable for the constructions of PCR primers. Here we report the cloning and expression of a tryptophan 5-halogenase gene, the purification of the enzyme in active form, the identification of the enzy-matic product, and the proof for the involvement of this tryptophan 5-halogenase in pyrroindomycin B biosyn-thesis.",
        "Results and Discussion",
        "Detection of the Tryptophan 5-Halogenase Gene Comparison of published amino acid sequences of tryptophan 7-halogenases from pyrrolnitrin-producing bacteria [7] and the putative tryptophan 7-halogenase involved in rebeccamycin biosynthesis in Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes [5] allowed the identification of four conserved regions (Figure 2) suitable for the construc-tion of four PCR primers. Using these primers in four combinations with total DNA from the pyrroindomycin producer Streptomyces rugosporus as the template DNA, a fragment of w700 bp (PCR-hal) could be ampli-fied with a combination of primers SZ003 and SZ005. Sequencing and analysis of the 700 bp PCR product shows an identity at the amino acid level to the trypto-phan halogenases used for the sequence alignment be-",

Vectors pOJ446 [17], pEFBA [18], and HZ1358 [19] were described previously, and pBluescript II SK (+) as from a commercial source [Stratagene]. pCIBhis was con-tructed through cloning of a 270 bp PCR-fragment from the -terminal expression region of pRSETB [Stratagene] including the olyhistidine tag and the MCS into the BamHI site of pPEH14 [4]. NA Manipulation and Sequencing lasmid DNA preparations, restriction endonuclease digestions, al-aline phosphatase treatments, ligations, and other DNA manipula-ions were performed according to standard procedures for E. coli 16]. A genomic library of S. rugosporus was constructed in pOJ446 ccording to published procedures [16] and packaged with Giga-ack III XL extract from Stratagene. Total DNA of S. rugosporus as isolated after treatment of the cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr with 10 mg l-1 lysozyme in lysozyme buffer (10 mM Tris and 0.3 M saccha-ose [pH 8]). The cells were pelleted and resuspended in NAE buffer 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 M EDTA [pH 8]). Proteinase K solution and DS were added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg ml-1 and 2%, espectively. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for a further 3 hr nd at 60\u00b0C for an additional 30 min. DNA was purified by phenol/ hloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Southern analysis, igoxigenin labeling of probes, hybridization, and detection were erformed according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Roche). ntroduction of DNA into S. rugosporus was performed through . coli-Streptomyces conjugation routinely used for Streptomyces 20]. DNA sequencing was performed by MWG biotech Ebersberg. omputer assisted database searches were carried out using the USAR program package (EMBL Heidelberg) and the BLAST pro-ram [21]. CR Amplification egenerated oligonucleotides were designed to locate the halo-enase gene in total DNA of S. rugosporus. They were derived from our conserved motifs present in the amino acid sequences of nown tryptophan halogenase proteins (Figure 2). These oligonu-leotides were used to attempt PCR amplification using total DNA rom S. rugosporus as the template. The sequences of two sense ligonucleotides were SZ002 (motif II) 5#-TCGGYGTSGGCGARGC ACCRTCCC-3# and SZ003 (motif I) 5#-TSGGCGGCGGCACYGC GGMTGGATG-3# and those of the two antisense oligonucleotides Z004 (motif IV) 5#-AGCATSGGRATCTTCCAGGTCCABCC-3# and Z005 (motif III) 5#-GCCGGAGCAGTCGAYGAASAGGTC-3#. PCR ixtures contained 50 ng of template DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, mM MgCl2, 2.5 U Taq DNA Polymerase (MBI fermentas), 5% MSO, and 0.2 mM dNTP-mix. Amplification was obtained by stan-ard procedure with an annealing temperature of 63.5\u00b0C. The PCR roduct of the oligonucleotides SZ003 and SZ005 was named CR-hal and subsequently used as the DNA probe for Southern hy-ridization. onstruction of Plasmids rom cosmid 6D1, a 4300 kb BamHI fragment was subcloned into he BamHI site of pBluescript II SK (+) yielding pB1G that contained he entire halogenase gene. For disruption of the halogenase gene, he apramycin resistance gene from pEFBA was cloned blunt-nded as a 1.5 kb HindIII-NdeI fragment into the blunt-ended PaeI ite internal in the halogenase gene of pB1G leading to the plasmid SZ594. The 5.8 kb BamHI fragment from pSZ594 was cloned into he same site of pHZ1358 yielding pSZ614 (Figure 5A).

The reaction was performed under standard conditions with an annealing temperature of 68.1\u00b0C. The PCR product was purified, digested with BamHI and HindIII, and ligated into the same sites of pCIBhis, generating pSZexM2. The amplified DNA se-quence was verified by sequencing. The plasmid pSZexM2 was then introduced into P. fluorescens BL915 NoneORF1 by conjugation, as described earlier [22]. The halogenase gene was constitutively expressed in P. fluorescens under control of the tac promoter [4]. Preparation of Crude Extracts, Protein Electrophoresis, and Protein Measurements Cells from a 2-day-old culture of P. fluorescens BL915 NoneORF1 pSZexM2 and control strain (containing pCIBhis) were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with saline. The cells were re-suspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and disrupted by sonication for 6 min (Branson sonifier 450, 160 W, 60% amplitude, 4\u00b0C). The crude extract was obtained by centrifu-gation (two times at 22,100 g, 4\u00b0C, 30 min) and immediately dia-lyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Flavin reductase-containing extracts were prepared from E. coli JM109 (DE3) pEE1001 [14]. Cells from an overnight culture were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 10 mM potassium phos-phate buffer (pH 7.2). The cells were resuspended in 100 mM po-tassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and disrupted by sonication for 2.5 min. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the crude extract containing Fre was used for enzyme assays after di-alysis against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) con-taining 10% glycerol. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Sch\u00e4gger and von Jagow [23] using 4.5% stacking gels and 10% resolving gels. For the estimation of protein size, Mark12 MW stan-dard (Novex) was used. Gels were stained for proteins with Coo-massie Brillant Blue R250. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Whitaker and Granum [24]. Enzyme Assay Halogenating activity was determined after incubating 100 Nonel of crude extract from P. fluorescens BL915 NoneORF1 pSZexM2 contain-ing recombinant tryptophan 5-halogenase or 100 Nonel of purified PyrH, respectively, with 4.5 mU Fre [25], 10 NoneM FAD, 2.4 mM NADH, 25 mM NaCl or NaBr, respectively, 0.6 mM L-tryptophan, and 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) in a total volume of 200 Nonel at 30\u00b0C for 6 hr (crude extract) and for 90 min (purified PyrH), respectively. The reaction was stopped by boiling in a water bath for 5 min. After removal of precipitated protein by centrifugation, 20 Nonel of the assay mixture was analyzed by HPLC. HPLC was per-formed on a Nucleosil 100 RP-18 column (5Nonem, 125 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, Bischoff) with MeOH/H2O/trifluoracetic acid (40:60:0.1) as the eluent with a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 and UV detection at 220 nm The products were identified by comparison of their retention times with reference substances, HPLC-UV spectra, and HPLC-ESI-MS. Purification of PyrH All purification steps were performed at 4\u00b0C. For purification, the cell-free extract was dialyzed overnight against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and loaded onto a nickel-chelating sepharose fast flow column (44 ml column volume). The column was washed with buffer A (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 7.2] and 0.15 M NaCl) until the absorbance at 280 nm remained constant. After a further washing step with 180 ml of 40% buffer B (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 7.2], 150 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole), PyrH was eluted with 100% buffer B. Fractions (2 ml) containing PyrH, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol. The purified enzyme was stored at -20\u00b0C. 1H NMR Analysis of 5-Chlorotryptophan A large-scale reaction (6 \u00d7 3 ml) containing 10 mM potassium phos-phate buffer [pH 7.2], 5 NoneM FAD, 25 mM NaCl, 0.6 mM L-trypto-phan, 1,560 U catalase, 5 mM NADH, 169 mU flavin reductase (Fre), and 1.5 ml of cell-free crude extract was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min with shaking (150 rpm). The assay mixtures were heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min and protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was fractionated by preparative HPLC using a Eu-rosphere-100 RP-18 column (5 Nonem, 250 mm \u00d7 20 mm, Knauer) with MeOH/H2O/ammonium acetate (40:60:0.1) as the eluent at a flow rate of 5 ml min-1. Fractions containing the chlorinated tryptophan derivative were pooled and methanol was evaporated in vacuo. The resulting aqueous solution was freeze dried. The remaining solid was dissolved in D2O and analyzed by 1H NMR. 1H NMR spectros-copy was performed in a Bruker NMR spectrometer DRX-500 sys-tem (TMS d = 0). Authentic 5-chlorotryptophan was purchased from Apin Chemicals Ltd. Isolation of Pyrroindomycins Spores of strains S. rugosporus NRRL 21084 and S. rugosporus SZTF1Hal were inoculated in NZ Amine A medium and cultivated at 30\u00b0C and 170 rpm for 3 days. Each seed culture was used to inoculate (2.5%, v/v) four Erlenmeyer flasks containing 250 ml of SO7 medium [3]. After incubation for 8 days under the same condi-tions, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Since the pyrroindo-mycins were found to be predominantly associated with the cell pellet, the cells were resuspended in a small volume of water and were twice extracted by shaking for 2 hr with 1.5 volumes of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was carefully removed and evaporated in vacuo. The dried extracts from the pellets of each strain were redissolved in 100 Nonel methanol and applied to HPLC analysis. HPLC and HPLC-ESI-MS Analysis Detection of tryptophan derivatives and pyrroindomycins was per-formed by HPLC (Knauer, Berlin, Germany) on a reversed phase column (Lichrosphere 100 RP-18, 5.0 Nonem 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, Bischoff), with acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water as eluent. A gradient from 10% to 100% acetonitrile over 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 was used. From each strain 20 Nonel of the extracts were injected. Detection and spectral characterization of peaks were performed with a photodiode array detector. Pyrroin-domycins were detected due to their characteristic UV/Vis spectra. The halogenation status of the compounds was monitored by HPLC-ESI-MS. For this purpose, cell-free extracts of the trypto-phan halogenation assay or crude methanol extracts of pyrroindo-mycins from cell extracts of wild-type and mutant strains were ana-lyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS. Separations were performed on a Merck Purospher column (RP-C18e, 125 \u00d7 4 mm, 4.0 Nonem) with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The UV detector (\u03bb = 214 nm) was connected in series with the mass spectrometer. Solvent A was 0.1% TFA and solvent B was acetonitrile/0.1%TFA (gradient 10%\u2013100% over 10 min). Injection volumes were 20 Nonel. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis was per-formed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent, Waldbronn, Ger-many) coupled to a Bruker Esquire 3000plus (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an ion-trap analyzer.",
