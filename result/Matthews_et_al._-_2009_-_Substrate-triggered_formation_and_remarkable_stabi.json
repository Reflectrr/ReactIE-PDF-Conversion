Triggering efficacy is sensitive to the structures of both the amino acid and the carrierprotein, being diminished by 5\u201320-fold when the native L-Thr is replaced by another amino acid andby \u223c 40-fold when SyrB1 is replaced by a heterologous carrier protein, CytC2. The directing effectof the carrier protein and consequent tolerance for profound modifications to the target amino acidallow the chloroferryl state to be formed in the presence of substrates that perturb the ratio of its twoputative coordination isomers, lack the target C-H bond (L-Ala-S-SyrB1), or contain a C-H bond ofenhanced strength (L-cyclopropylglycyl-S-SyrB1). For the latter two cases, the SyrB2 chloroferrylstate so formed exhibits unprecedented stability (t1/2 = 30 \u2013 110 min at 0 \u00b0C), can be trapped in highconcentration and purity by manual freezing without a cryo-solvent, and represents an ideal targetfor structural characterization. As initial steps toward this goal, extended x-ray absorption finestructure (EXAFS) spectroscopy has been used to determine the Fe-O and Fe-Cl distances and densityfunctional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to confirm that the measured distances areconsistent with the anticipated structure of the intermediate.INTRODUCTION The Fe(II)-and \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases activate O2 at mononuclear non-hemeFe(II) centers to catalyze hydroxylation, desaturation, cyclization, and isomerization reactions(1-4). In each case, the two-electron oxidation of the substrate is coupled to oxidativedecarboxylation of the co-substrate, \u03b1 ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG), to CO2 and succinate, providingthe two additional reducing equivalents needed to balance the four-electron reduction of O2.In the most extensively studied members of the family, the Fe(II) cofactors are similarlycoordinated by a conserved (His)2(Asp/Glu) \u201cfacial triad\u201d of protein ligands (5,6). Bidentatecoordination of \u03b1KG leaves one remaining position in the octahedral coordination sphere towhich O2 can add to be activated (2,7,8). As first proposed by Hanauske-Abel and G\u00fcnzler (inwhat the first author later termed the \u201cHAG\u201d mechanism (9)), this step leads to formation ofa hydrogen-abstracting iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate (Scheme 1A) (10). In the reactionsof two family members, taurine:\u03b1KG dioxygenase (TauD) and a prolyl-4-hydroxlase (P4H)from Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1), the ferryl complexes have beendirectly demonstrated (11,12). The kinetics of the ferryl intermediates were monitored instopped-flow experiments by their ultraviolet absorption (at \u223c 320 nm) and in freeze-quenchM\u00f6ssbauer experiments by their quadrupole doublets with low isomer shift (\u223c 0.3 mm/s).Large substrate deuterium kinetic isotope effects (2H-KIEs) on decay of the intermediates(kH/kD = 50-60) showed that they both abstract hydrogen (12,13). The TauD intermediate wasfurther characterized by resonance Raman (rR) (14) and extended x-ray absorption finestructure (EXAFS) spectroscopies (15), which confirmed the presence of the Fe=O unit.According to the HAG mechanism, the ferryl complex abstracts a hydrogen atom (H\u2022), andsubsequent \u201crebound\u201d (16) of a hydroxyl radical equivalent from the resultant Fe(III)-OHcomplex to the substrate radical yields the hydroxylated product and Fe(II) form of the cofactor(Scheme 1A) (10).SyrB2 from the syringomycin E biosynthetic system in Pseudomonas syringae B301D wasrecently characterized as the founding member of a sub-family of \u03b1KG-dependent oxygenasesthat effect oxidative halogenation (mono-and di-chlorination and bromination) of unactivatedcarbon centers in the biosyntheses of natural products by non-ribosomal peptide synthetasesMatthews et al.Page 2Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript (NRPSs) (17-21). The structure of the enzyme determined by x-ray crystallography revealedthe carboxylate ligand from the canonical facial triad to be absent, replaced in the proteinsequence by a non-coordinating alanine and in the Fe(II) coordination sphere by a halide ion(22). A mechanism derived from the HAG dioxygenase mechanism was proposed for SyrB2and other aliphatic halogenases (Scheme 1B). The crucial features are, first, the formation ofa haloferryl [X-Fe(IV)=O; X = Cl, Br] intermediate that abstracts H\u2022 from the substrate and,second, the rebound of the halogen atom, rather than the hydroxyl radical, from the resultantX-Fe(III)-OH complex to the substrate radical (22). The proposed C-H-cleaving intermediatewas subsequently (i) detected in the reaction of the halogenase, CytC3 (from the cytotrienin Aproducer, Streptomyces sp. RK95-74; Scheme 2B), (ii) shown by the large substrate 2H-KIEon its decay to abstract hydrogen, and (iii) demonstrated by EXAFS spectroscopy to have theexpected X-Fe=O unit (for X = Br) (23,24). Interestingly, the haloferryl intermediate state wasshown by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy to comprise two distinct Fe(IV) complexes, which werespeculatively assigned as rapidly interconverting coordination isomers. It was suggested thatthis isomerism could reflect conformational dynamics required for the alternative (halogenrather than hydroxyl) rebound (23).An important characteristic of several (perhaps most) \u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases is \u201csubstratetriggering\u201d (ST), a marked activation of the Fe(II) cofactor for reaction with O2 caused bybinding of the substrate (1-3). By disfavoring or preventing formation of the potently oxidizingferryl complex until its oxidation target is in place, ST is thought to protect the enzyme againstdeleterious auto-oxidation reactions. For TauD, taurine binding was shown to trigger the O2reaction by \u223c 1000-fold (25,26). It is possible that the untriggered (lacking taurine) reactionmight even proceed by a different mechanism, as no evidence could be obtained foraccumulation of the ferryl complex under these conditions (1, 26).Pioneering work of Solomon and co-workers showed first for clavaminate synthase andsubsequently for other family members (including TauD) that conversion of the Fe(II) site from6-coordinate (6C) to 5 coordinate (5C), making available the site to which O2 adds, is at leastpartly responsible for the ST phenomenon (2,7,8,27). It is thought that a protein conformationalchange associated with substrate binding promotes dissociation of a water ligand, although theresultant 6C \u2192 5C change may in some cases be incomplete (8). To our knowledge, ST hasnot been systematically examined for the halogenases, although the partial 6C \u2192 5C changeupon addition of substrate was also observed for CytC3 (8). The substrate of a halogenase iscomplex and tri-modular, consisting of an amino acid (L-Thr for the case of SyrB2) tetheredvia thioester linkage to a phosphopantetheine (PPant) cofactor, which is in turn covalentlyattached via one of its Ser residues to a carrier protein (SyrB1) (Scheme 2) (17,19-21). In thisstudy, we tested for ST in SyrB2, finding: (i) that, indeed, reaction of the SyrB2\u2022Fe(II)\u2022\u03b1KG\u2022Cl-complex with O2 is 8,000 times faster in the presence of the native substrate (L-Thr-S-SyrB1) than in either the absence of the carrier protein or the presence of SyrB1 with itsPPant module not charged by an amino acid (HS-SyrB1); and (ii) that only in the former casedoes the chloroferryl complex demonstrably accumulate. Contacts between the halogenase andboth the carrier protein module and the amino acid module appear to contribute to ST, butforms of SyrB1 charged by a non-native amino acid still trigger by as much as \u223c 1300-fold,and the L-Thr-charged form of the heterologous carrier protein, CytC2 (the carrier protein forthe CytC3 halogenase), triggers by 300-fold. The tolerance for modifications to both terminalmodules of the substrate affords several unique opportunities to explore the structure of thechloroferryl state, the nature of its conformational isomerism, and the mechanism by which iteffects aliphatic chlorination. For example, variation of the amino acid is shown to allow theratio of the two constituent complexes to be varied from \u223c 4:1 for L-Thr-S-SyrB1 to \u223c 1:5 forL-cyclopropylglycine-S-SyrB1, a tool that should be useful for exploring the structuraldistinction between them by spectroscopy and computation. Conversely, use of the 10-kDaheterologous carrier protein, CytC2 (the carrier protein for CytC3), in place of the 66 kDaMatthews et al.Page 3Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript SyrB1 allows the O2-reactive SyrB2\u2022substrates complex, and thus potentially the chloroferrylintermediate, to be prepared at concentrations approaching the solubility of SyrB2 itself (> 5mM). Most importantly, the directing effect of the carrier protein permits the chloroferryl stateto be formed with drastically modified amino acids that either lack the target C-H bond (L-Ala-S-SyrB1) or have a C-H bond of enhanced strength (L-cyclopropylglycyl-S-SyrB1). The SyrB2chloroferryl state so formed is remarkably stable (t1/2 = 30 \u2013 110 min at 0 \u00b0C), can be trappedin high concentration and purity by manual freezing without a cryo-solvent, and represents anideal target for structural characterization. We use EXAFS spectroscopy on samples of thechloroferryl state prepared in this manner to obtain two crucial metrics, the Fe\u2013O and Fe\u2013Cldistances, for the SyrB2 intermediate. These metric parameters are consistent with thoseobtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.MATERIAL AND METHODSMaterials Yeast extract and tryptone were purchased from Marcor Development Corporation (Carlstadt,NJ).

Sephadex G-75 resin waspurchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ).Over-expression and Purification of SyrB and CytC ProteinsEach protein used in this study, including SyrB2, SyrB1, CytC2, CytC1 and Sfp, has anadditional 20 amino acids (MGS2H6S2GLVPRGSH) appended to the N-terminal methionineresidue. The appendage contains a His6 element to permit purification of the protein by metalion affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose. Preparation of the plasmids that direct over-expression of these proteins in E. coli, growth of the over-expression strains, and purificationof the proteins has been described (17,29,30). The over-expression and purification procedureshave been adapted for purification in an aerobic environment, as described below.Cultures of the over-producing strains were grown aerobically at 37 \u00b0C in rich LB broth (35g/L tryptone, 20 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl, 0.05 g/L kanamycin, pH 7.0) to an opticaldensity at 600 nm of 0.6-0.8. They were cooled rapidly by incubation on ice for 30 min priorto addition of IPTG to 200 \u03bcM. Following induction, cultures were grown at 15-18 \u00b0C for anadditional 16-18 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell paste was flash-frozenin liquid N2 and stored at-80 \u00b0C. A typical yield was \u223c 10-12 g of wet cell paste per liter ofMatthews et al.Page 4Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript culture. The frozen cell paste was resuspended in 5 mL/g 50 mM Na-Hepes buffer (pH 7.5)containing 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 0.25 mM PMSF, 0.1 mg/mL Dnase I, 1 mMCaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2. The cells were lysed at 4 \u00b0C by a single passage through a Frenchpressure cell at 16000 psi, and the resulting lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min. Thesupernatant was stirred gently with Ni-NTA resin (\u223c 1 mL of resin per 5 mL of supernatant)for \u223c 30 min. The slurry was loaded into a column and washed with 50 mM Na-Hepes buffer,pH 7.5, containing 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. Protein was eluted from the resin with50 mM Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole. Fractionscontaining the desired protein, as identified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(SDS PAGE) with Coomassie staining, were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Na-Hepesbuffer, pH 7.5 (reaction buffer), supplemented with 1 mM EDTA. The protein was thendialyzed against two changes of reaction buffer lacking EDTA to remove the metal chelator.Following dialysis, all proteins were concentrated to \u223c 200 mg/mL prior to flash freezing andstorage at -80 \u00b0C.Determination of Protein ConcentrationsThe proteins were quantified spectrophotometrically by assuming molar absorptivities (\u03b5280)of 75,290 M-1cm-1 for SyrB1 (68,307 Da), 59,610 M-1cm-1 for SyrB2 (37,523 Da), 29,130M-1cm-1 for Sfp (31,684 Da), 5,500 M-1cm-1 for CytC2 (11,585 Da), and 68,090 M-1cm-1for CytC1 (58,921 Da) as calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (31).Substrate Assembly: Phosphopantetheinylation of the Carrier Protein and Charging ofAmino Acids onto the PPant CofactorPhosphopantetheinylation of the purified apo-forms of both carrier proteins (CytC2 and SyrB1)was effected by treatment with Sfp, a phosphopantheinyl transferase from Bacillus subtilis(30), according to the following procedure (17,29). The apo-form of the carrier protein (300\u03bcM) was incubated with 10 \u03bcM Sfp, 50 mM MgCl2, and 1.5 mM of the PPant precursor,coenzyme A, at room temperature for 1.5 h with occasional stirring (100 \u2013 200 mL). Themixture was concentrated and loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column [26 mm (i.d.) \u00d7 100 cm] equilibrated with 20 mM Na-Hepes, pH 7.5. Fractions containingphosphopanthetheinylated carrier protein were pooled, concentrated and flash frozen.The PPant cofactor of SyrB1 (at a final concentration of 1-5 mM) was charged with an aminoacid by incubation with 10 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM amino acid at roomtemperature. To append the amino acid to holo-CytC2 (at a final concentration of 10-25 mM),the reaction was supplemented with catalytic amounts of CytC1 (\u223c 10-fold less than holo-CytC2). The reaction mixture was prepared and O2 was removed as previously described(11) for subsequent stopped-flow absorption or rapid freeze-quench M\u00f6ssbauer experiments.The efficiency of PPant attachment and subsequent charging of the PPant by the amino acidwas determined by titration of free thiol content of SyrB1 and CytC2 with Ellman's reagent(DTNB). The \u0394A412 signal (\u03b5 = 13,600 M-1cm-1) from the free thiols in the carrier proteins(one Cys residue in SyrB1 and none in CytC2) is first enhanced by attachment of the PPant(giving two total thiols in SyrB1 and one in CytC2) and subsequently diminished due toprotection by the amino acid during the charging reaction. The change in the intensity of thesignal was used to calculate the extent of PPant attachment and amino acid charging. Treatmentof an ATP-depleted reaction mixture with the thioesterase, TycF (32), at room temperatureafter charging by the amino acid resulted in a complete regain of the absorbance that was lostduring the charging step, confirming the specificity of the Ellman's signal.Stopped-Flow Absorption Experiments and Kinetic AnalysisIn an anaerobic glovebox (MBraun; Stratham, NH) buffered (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5), O2-freestock solutions of sodium chloride, \u03b1KG, and ferrous ammonium sulfate were subsequentlyMatthews et al.Page 5Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript added to a concentrated, O2-free (accomplished as previously described (11)) solution of apo-SyrB2 at 5 \u00b0C to final concentrations of 100 mM, 10 mM, 300 \u03bcM, and 360 \u03bcM, respectively.Subsequently, deoxygenated substrate (at 5 \u00b0C), was added to give at least 3-fold excess ofsubstrate over Fe(II) (except in the experiments to vary this ratio explicitly). The resultantSyrB2\u2022Fe(II)\u2022\u03b1KG\u2022Cl-\u2022substrate complex was mixed with an equal volume of oxygen-saturated buffer (\u223c 1.9 mM O2) at 5 \u00b0C in an Applied Photophysics (Surrey, U.K.) SX.18MVstopped flow apparatus with a monochromatic light source and photomultiplier detector, aspreviously described (11). The absorbance at 318 nm, diagnostic of the Fe(IV) intermediate inthe Fe(II) and \u03b1KG dependent hydroxylases (TauD and P4H) and halogenases (CytC3), wasmonitored with time. The A318-versus-time traces were fit (using Kaleidagraph; SynergySoftware, Reading, PA) by equation 1 describing the absorbance from species I in an R\u2192I\u2192Preaction sequence in which R and P do not absorb. In this equation, k1 and k2 are the rateconstants for formation and decay of the intermediate, [R]o is the initial concentration of thereactant, R, and \u03b5I is the molar absorptivity of the intermediate species, I.(1) Preparation of Freeze-Quenched M\u00f6ssbauer SamplesPreparation of freeze-quench samples was as previously described (33). A reactant solutioncontaining all components but O2 was mixed with O2-saturated buffer, and the reaction wasrapidly frozen after the desired reaction time. Reactant solutions used with the L-Thr-, L-Val-and d8-L-Val-containing substrates were prepared essentially as described above for thestopped-flow experiments, with the exception that natural abundance Fe(II) was replacedwith 57Fe(II). After mixing, the composition of samples prepared with the L-Thr substrates was[57Fe] = 610 \u03bcM, [SyrB2] = 700 \u03bcM, [substrate] = 776 \u03bcM, [\u03b1KG] = 3.3 mM, and [NaCl] =10 mM; the composition of samples prepared with L-Val and d8-L-Val substrates was [57Fe] =406 \u03bcM, [SyrB2] = 430 \u03bcM, [substrate] = 1.28 mM, [\u03b1KG] = 5 mM, and [NaCl] = 25 mM.Preparation of Manually Frozen M\u00f6ssbauer Samples by Direct Oxygenation with O2(g)O2-free solutions of SyrB2, \u03b1KG, NaCl, 57Fe(II), and L-Ala-or L-Cpg-containing substrate werecombined to give concentrations of 1.2 mM, 5 mM, 50 mM, 1.2 mM, and \u2265 3 mM, respectively.The solution was placed in a sealed vacuum flask that was stirred vigorously on ice by amagnetic stir bar thick enough to project above the surface of the solution. The flask was brieflyevacuated to < 50 torr and then refilled with 2 atm of O2(g). After 1 additional min of vigorousstirring at 0 \u00b0C, the flask was opened to air and incubation on ice without stirring was continued.Samples were removed at appropriate reaction times and added to M\u00f6ssbauer sample cups thatwere then frozen and stored in liquid N2.M\u00f6ssbauer Spectroscopy and AnalysisM\u00f6ssbauer spectra were recorded on a spectrometer from WEB research (Edina, MN) equippedwith a SVT-400 cryostat (Janis, Wilmington, MA) with the temperature of the samplemaintained at 4.2 K. The reported values of the isomer shift are relative to the centroid of ametallic foil of \u03b1-Fe at room temperature. Analysis of the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra was carried outusing the program WMOSS from WEB research (Edina, MN). The concentration of the Fe(IV) species in each sample was determined as the product of the fractional contribution of its\u2018reference\u2019 spectrum to each experimental spectrum and the total [57Fe]. Reference spectra forthe Fe(IV) states with the different substrates were generated from the experimental spectra ofsamples with the maximum concentration of the intermediate by removing the features of theother components contained in the samples.

In addition, spectra collected on samples with d8-L-Val-S-SyrB1, L-Ala-S-SyrB1,or L-Cpg-S-SyrB1 as substrate, in particular samples frozen after prolonged reaction times,were found to contain significant quantities of the broad and magnetically split features typicalof mononuclear high-spin Fe(III), which is often observed as a consequence of univalent decayof the Fe(IV) intermediate(s). For samples containing high-spin Fe(III) species, 4.2-K/53-mTspectra collected over a wider range of Doppler velocities (\u223c \u00b1 12 mm/s) were used todetermine the relative amounts of the components. The spectrum of a sample of the SyrB2\u2022Fe(II)\u2022\u03b1KG\u2022Cl-\u2022HS-SyrB1 complex after reaction with O2 for 17 min (Figure S2) is dominatedby similar Fe(III)-associated features and was used to remove these features from the spectraof samples with d8-L-Val-S-SyrB1, L-Ala-S-SyrB1, and L-Cpg-S-SyrB1 substrates prior tofurther spectral analysis.Experimental reference spectra for the Fe(IV) complexes were generated by removing theexperimental reference spectra of the other components as previously described (12,23,34). Inaddition, spectra were fit by multiple quadrupole doublets, representing the two Fe(IV)complexes of the chloroferryl state and the high-spin Fe(II) complexes. The sum of the two Fe(IV)-associated doublets was used as a theoretical reference spectrum for the chloroferryl state.An alternative \u2018experimental\u2019 reference spectrum for the chloroferryl state was obtained bysubtraction of the theoretical contribution of the Fe(II) complexes from the raw spectrum byusing its best-fit quadrupole doublet. The different methods of generating reference spectra ofthe Fe(IV) intermediates yielded nearly identical parameters (\u223c \u00b1 0.03 mm/s) and fractionalcontributions (\u223c \u00b1 5 %) (see Table S1).Preparation of Samples for X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS)Samples of the intermediate formed in the presence of the L-Cpg-S-CytC2 substrate wereprepared as above by direct oxygenation at 0 \u00b0C (see above), placed in M\u00f6ssbauer and XASsample cups (35), and rapidly frozen by immersion in isopentane (total reaction time of \u223c 4min). The final sample concentrations were 1.98 mM 57Fe, 2.47 mM SyrB2, 5 mM \u03b1KG, 50mM NaCl, and 5.9 mM L-Cpg-S-CytC2. Samples of the reactant complex not exposed to O2were also prepared.XAS data collection and analysisXAS data were collected in fluorescence mode at \u223c 10 K with a 30-element Germaniumdetector (SSRL, BL7-3) using a Si(220) \u03a6 = 90\u00b0 double crystal monochromator with a 9.5 keVcutoff for harmonic rejection. To minimize the effects of photoreduction, samples were movedin the beam so that unexposed sample was examined every two scans (exposure time at eachspot \u223c 30 min, \u223c 15 min per scan). The edge energy did not shift during the two scans (FigureS3) demonstrating that photoreduction was not a problem. XAS data were obtained byaveraging 11 total first and second scans for each state. Background removal and analysis ofthe EXAFS data were accomplished with EXAFSPAK (available athttp://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/exafspak.html). Fits were also obtained by usingEXAFSPAK and ab initio phases and amplitudes generated with the program FEFF v7.0(36). Data sets were fit over the region k = 3-13 \u00c5-1 (for the samples of the intermediate) andk = 2-12 \u00c5-1 (for samples of the reactant complex). Both complexes were fit with coordinationnumbers ranging from 3 to 7. Coordination numbers were constrained during fits. All distancesand Debye-Waller factors were treated as adjustable parameters, and all the threshold energyshifts, E0, were linked but allowed to vary. The passive electron reduction factor S0 was heldat 0.9. Edge Energies were calibrated by using Fe metal foil (7111.3 eV). Edge positions wereMatthews et al.Page 7Biochemistry.

The water ligand was replaced by an oxygen atom and the pyruvate byacetate. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION1. Substrate Triggering (ST) in SyrB2Testing for Chloroferryl Intermediate Accumulation and ST in SyrB2\u2014To test forST in SyrB2, its reaction with O2 in the presence of the complete, native substrate, SyrB1charged by L-Thr (L-Thr-S-SyrB1) (17), was first examined. Upon mixing of an anoxic solutioncontaining SyrB2, Fe(II), \u03b1KG, Cl-, and L-Thr-S-SyrB1 at 5 \u00b0C with O2 saturated buffer, theabsorbance at 318 nm (A318) rises to a maximum with an apparent first-order rate constant,kobs, of 48 \u00b1 4 s-1 (with O2 in excess at \u223c 0.9 mM) and then decays to its initial value withkobs = (71 \u00b1 6) \u00d7 10-3 s-1 (Figure 1A, black trace). Analogy to previous results on TauD, P4H,and CytC3 would suggest that the A318 transient reflects accumulation and decay of thehydrogen abstracting-chloroferryl intermediate state. This inference is confirmed by the 2H-KIE of \u223c 20 on the decay phase (Figure 1A, gray trace) seen upon use of L-Thr-S-SyrB1 havingall five exchange-inert hydrogen atoms of the L-Thr (including those in the target side chainmethyl group) substituted by deuterium (d5-L-Thr). More directly, the 4.2-K/zero-fieldM\u00f6ssbauer spectra of freeze-quenched samples from the reaction (Figure 2A) exhibit transientfeatures that can be analyzed as a pair of partially resolved quadrupole doublets with parameters\u03b41 = 0.30 mm/s, \u0394EQ,1 = 1.09 mm/s (red line in Figure 2A) and \u03b42 = 0.23 mm/s, \u0394EQ,2 = 0.76mm/s (blue line). The similarity of these parameters to those determined previously for thechloroferryl state in CytC3 (23) confirms the accumulation of the corresponding state in theSyrB2 reaction. The presence of two doublets at an intensity ratio that is essentially constantwith time (at \u223c 4:1) suggests that, as in the CytC3 reaction, the SyrB2 intermediate statecomprises two Fe(IV) complexes in equilibrium. Although the \u223c 4:1 intensity ratio in SyrB2is different from the \u223c 1:1 ratio seen in CytC3, results presented below show that the SyrB2ratio varies with the amino acid that is tethered to SyrB1. From the sum of the contributionsof the two Fe(IV)-associated doublets to the total absorption area of each M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum,the kinetics of the SyrB2 intermediate state were determined (black circles in Figure 1A). Theycoincide well with the \u0394A318-versus time traces.Replacement of L-Thr-S-SyrB1 with SyrB1 lacking an amino acid on its PPant cofactor (HS-SyrB1) markedly changes the reaction kinetics (Figure 1A, red trace). UV absorption develops8,000-fold less rapidly and is stable rather than transient (on the 1,000-s maximum timescaleof the stopped-flow apparatus). Moreover, the slowly developing absorption is not associatedwith the chloroferryl intermediate state, as the 4.2-K/zero-field M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum of asample freeze-quenched at approximately the half-time of the rise phase lacks the signature ofthe intermediate (Spectrum A in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). At completion ofthe rise phase, features characteristic of high-spin Fe(III) species dominate the M\u00f6ssbauerspectrum (Figure S2). Reactions either lacking SyrB1 entirely or containing SyrB1 lacking itsPPant cofactor give \u03b4A318-versus-time traces nearly identical to that for the reaction with HS-SyrB1 (not shown). Inclusion in the reaction of free L-Thr or its carboxylate \u2192 alcoholMatthews et al.Page 8Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript analogue, L-threoninol (chosen with the intent of mimicking the charge-neutralizing effect ofthioesterification of L-Thr with the PPant thiol) together with HS-SyrB1 does not noticeablyaccelerate the reaction. In short, the complete, native substrate, L-Thr-S-SyrB1, triggers reactionof SyrB2 with O2 by 8,000-fold and may even change the reaction mechanism [in light of thefact that (i) the chloroferryl state does not accumulate and (ii) Fe(III) rather than Fe(II) productsare generated in the \u2018untriggered\u2019 reaction], the tethered amino acid is necessary for ST, andneither the free amino acid nor a carboxylate-neutralized analogue of it has any triggeringeffect. The incompetence of free amino acids for ST may be partly (if not completely)responsible for their reported failure to be halogenated (20, 21, 38, 39). The factor by whichSyrB2 is triggered by its native substrate is greater than any yet observed for a member of thisenzyme family. By comparison, TauD is triggered by 1,000-fold (25, 26), PBCV-1 P4H by500-fold (12), and CytC3 by 40-fold under similar reaction conditions.Dependence of ST Efficacy on the Structure of the Amino Acid Side Chain\u2014Having established that ST is operant in SyrB2 and that the tethered amino acid is essential forit, we next addressed whether the structure of the amino acid, or merely the fact that it caps thePPant as thioester, is more important for ST. SyrB1 species representing (i) replacement of thehydroxyl group of the L-Thr sidechain by either hydrogen (L-Aba-S-SyrB1, where L-Aba denotesL-2-aminobutyric acid) or a second methyl (L-Val-S-SyrB1), (ii) replacement of the targetmethyl by hydrogen (L-Ser-S-SyrB1), and (iii) replacement of both \u03b2 substituents by hydrogens(L-Ala-S-SyrB1) were tested for ST efficacy under the same reaction conditions as for the nativesubstrate. Qualitatively, each of the four non-native amino acids triggers the O2 reaction whentethered to SyrB1 (Figure 1B, D). In every case, UV absorption develops with a kobs of 2 \u2013 8s-1, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the reaction with HS-SyrB1. For the twosubstrates retaining the \u03b3-methyl halogenation target (L-Aba-S-SyrB1 and L-Val-S-SyrB1), theattribution of the transient absorption to the chloroferryl intermediate state is confirmed by twolines of evidence. For both substrates, large 2H-KIEs on the decay phases (Figure 1B, comparelight and dark traces) demonstrate that the intermediate abstracts hydrogen. For L-Val-S-SyrB1,M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of freeze-quench samples (Figure 2B and C, yielding blue circles in Figure1B) from the reactions of both unlabeled and deuterium-labeled substrates demonstrate bothaccumulation of the chloroferryl state and the coincidence of its kinetics with the A318transients. For the substrates lacking the \u03b3-methyl halogenation target (L-Ala-S-SyrB1 and L-Ser-S-SyrB1), the UV absorption fails to decay on the maximum timescale (1,000 s) of thestopped-flow apparatus (Figure 1D, green trace). This observation is consistent with theexpectation that the absence of the target hydrogen should stabilize the chloroferryl state to aneven greater extent than deuterium substitution, as is verified and discussed in more detail ina later section.Quantitatively, the triggering efficacies (as assessed by kobs for chloroferryl intermediateformation under a common set of reaction conditions) of the four non-native substrates are 5\u201324-fold less than that of the native substrate. In principle, the diminished efficacy could reflectdiminished binding affinity for the non-native substrate or less profound activation of the Fe(II) cofactor toward reaction with O2 in the complex (or a combination of the two). To addressthis issue, variation of the concentration of one of the non-native substrates (L-Val-S-SyrB1)was carried out. The value of kobs for the formation phase extracted by regression analysis ofthe traces in Figure 3A increases by less than 50% as the concentration of L-Val-S-SyrB1 isincreased by a factor of four. This kinetic order of much less than one implies saturation ofSyrB2 by the non-native substrate at the higher ratios. If the dependence of kobs on [L-Val-S-SyrB1] is treated as a hyperbolic function, the limiting y-value (3.7 s-1) is less than one tenththe kobs for the native substrate reaction at a L-Thr-S-SyrB1:SyrB2 ratio of 3 (which issaturating). This analysis implies that the identity of the amino acid affects the O2 reactivityof the complex, in addition to any effect on affinity that it may have. The observations suggestthat the halogenase makes contacts both with the PPant-thioester terminus and with bothMatthews et al.Page 9Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript substituents on the \u03b2 methine carbon of the appended L-Thr, as any modification of the sidechain diminishes ST efficacy without eliminating the considerable (\u2265 400-fold) activationconferred by the attachment of any amino acid. It is possible that even further truncation of thenative L-Thr (e.g., Gly or perhaps even acetyl) might be tolerated without loss of this side-chain-independent contribution to ST. We attempted to test Gly but found that the adenylationmodule of SyrB1 was unable to charge the sidechain-less amino acid onto the PPant of thecarrier domain.Dependence of ST Efficacy on the Identity of the Carrier Protein\u2014Havingestablished (i) that ST is operant in SyrB2, (ii) that attachment of any amino acid to the PPantof SyrB1 is quantitatively most important for it, and (iii) that its efficacy is still moderatelysensitive to the structure of the amino acid side chain, we next asked whether the structure ofthe carrier domain impacts ST efficacy. L-Thr was appended to CytC2, the carrier protein forthe CytC3 halogenase from the cytotrienin biosynthetic system (Scheme 2B) (29). WhereasSyrB1 comprises an adenylation (A) domain to activate the amino acid for attachment to thePPant on its thiolation (T) domain (Scheme 2A), CytC2 is a stand-alone thiolation domain(which is charged with the amino acid by the separate adenylation protein, CytC1) and isconsequently smaller (11 kDa including the affinity tag) than SyrB1 (66 kDa), a characteristicpotentially useful for accumulation of the intermediate state to very high concentrations (seebelow). L-Thr-S-CytC2 triggers formation of the chloroferryl intermediate state in SyrB2(Figure 1C). Quantitatively, it is less effective than the native substrate by \u223c 40-fold at thesame concentration. However, the linear dependence on [L-Thr-S-CytC2] of kobs for thedevelopment phase of the A318 transient (Figure 3B) suggests that the diminished ST efficacyof the substrate containing the native amino acid tethered to the heterologous carrier proteincould reflect primarily a diminished affinity for the halogenase. Together, the data suggest thatthe carrier protein provides the more important binding determinants for complex formation,delivering the amino acid to the halogenase active site, and that specific contacts with the sidechain then condition the active site in a manner that further activates for O2 addition andchloroferryl intermediate formation.Effects of the Side Chain on the Chloroferryl State and its C\u2013H CleavageEfficiency\u2014The amino acid side chain exerts three additional, intriguing effects on thehalogenase reaction. The first is on the distribution of the intermediate state between its twoconstituent complexes, as reflected by the relative contributions of the two partially resolvedM\u00f6ssbauer quadrupole doublets. Whereas the ratio is \u223c 4:1 with the native substrate (Figure2A), it is \u223c 1:1 with L-Val-S-SyrB1. With the L-cyclopropylglycine substrate (L-Cpg-S-SyrB1)discussed in the next section, the ratio shifts even further to \u223c 1:5. The ability to change thecomposition of the intermediate state potentially provides a tool to understand the structuraldistinction between its constituent complexes. It also contrasts with previous observations onCytC3, wherein the chloroferryl state was shown to have a \u223c 1:1 ratio of the two putativecoordination isomers when formed with either L-Aba and L-Val-charged CytC2 (23). Thesecond effect is on the electronic structure of the iron in the chloroferryl state, as reflected bythe M\u00f6ssbauer parameters. In particular, the quadrupole splitting parameter (\u0394EQ) ofchloroferryl species 1 prepared with substrates having two non-hydrogen substituents on C\u03b2(i.e. L-Thr-S-SyrB1, L-Val-S-SyrB1, and L-Cpg-S-SyrB1) is larger than for the complex preparedwith substrates having only one (L-Aba-S-SyrB1) or no C\u03b2 substituent (L-Ala-S-SyrB1) (1.09\u20131.14 mm/s compared to 0.99 mm/s). The third effect is on the kinetics of decay of thechloroferryl state. The A318 kinetic traces for the L-Val-S-SyrB1 and L-Aba-S-SyrB1 reactions(Figure 1B) show that decay of the chloroferryl state to the Fe(II) product state by C\u2013H cleavageand (presumably) chlorination is at least 10-fold faster for the substrate lacking the second \u03b3methyl group, despite the fact that the target C\u2013H bonds are expected to have similar homolyticbond dissociation energies (BDEs; listed on left of Figure 1). Conversely, the rate constantsMatthews et al.Page 10Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript for decay with the \u03b2-disubstituted L-Val-and L-Thr-containing substrates are nearly identical(compare Figure 1, A and B), despite the expectation that their C\u2013H BDEs should differconsiderably. In addition, the 2H-KIE is somewhat greater for the faster reaction (\u223c 50 for L-Aba-S-SyrB1) than for the two slower reactions (\u223c 20 for L-Thr-S-SyrB1 and \u223c 30 for L-Val-S-SyrB1). The origins of these kinetic effects are not clear, but it is possible that the absenceof the second substituent to C\u03b2 (hydroxyl or methyl) to anchor the side chain within the SyrB2active site allows the target hydrogen to achieve greater proximity or more frequent closeapproach to the chloroferryl oxygen, a situation expected to favor both more rapid C\u2013Hcleavage and a larger 2H-KIE (40).2. Exploring the Limit of Stability of the Chloroferryl Intermediate in SyrB2Unprecedented Protection of Chloroferryl State by SyrB2\u2014Figures 1B and 2Cillustrate that the chloroferryl intermediate in SyrB2 decays remarkably slowly [k = (3.1 \u00b1 0.3)\u00d7 10-3 s-1] in its reaction with the deuterium-labeled L-Val-S-SyrB1 substrate. Indeed, the half-life of almost three minutes (at 5 \u00b0C) is the longest yet observed for a non-heme ferryl enzymeintermediate (4, 11-13, 23, 41).2 Moreover, the spectra in Figure 3A illustrate that, despite itslong lifetime, the intermediate decays primarily (> 70%) to Fe(II) products, as occurs inproductive halogenation (which was not explicitly demonstrated). This observation contrastswith previous results on CytC3, in which decay of the intermediate in the presence of thedeuterium-labeled substrate, 4,4,4-d3-L-Aba-S-CytC2, was seen to yield more Fe(III) complex(es), suggesting that unproductive univalent reduction of the intermediate competes effectivelywith the productive pathway initiated by deuterium abstraction (23). The implication is thatSyrB2 suppresses the alternative decay pathway(s) to a greater extent than does CytC3. Thissuppression is also much greater than for TauD, the only other member of the family for whichdata are available to assess this issue (26). Evidence suggests that, in TauD, a specific tyrosineresidue (Y73) near the Fe cofactor can be oxidized to a radical, providing a potential source ofthe electron for univalent decay of the ferryl complex (43). SyrB2 possesses multiple tyrosineresidues in similar proximity to its cofactor. Why these Y residues do not reduce thechloroferryl state more efficiently (i.e., how SyrB2 prevents this undesired side reaction) is anintriguing question for future investigation.Extending the Lifetime of the Chloroferryl State by Target Removal orModification\u2014The unusually effective suppression of alternative, unproductive pathwaysfor decay of the chlorinating intermediate, combined with the modularity of the SyrB2 substrateand tolerance for significant side chain modifications, suggested the opportunity for furtherstabilization of the intermediate. To explore the limit of stabilization of the chloroferrylcomplex by SyrB2, we tested two alternative substrates, the aforementioned L-Ala-S-SyrB1and L-Cpg-S-SyrB1. The former substrate lacks the chlorination target altogether and the latterpossesses a stronger target C\u2013H bond (BDE of \u223c106 kcal/mol (44)) that we anticipated mightbe too strong for the chloroferryl intermediate to cleave (see Figure 1). In each reaction,A318 develops with kinetics (Figure 1D, solid traces) similar to those observed for the L-Valsubstrate (Figure 1B, dark blue trace). Consistent with the desired stabilization of theintermediate (and as noted above for the L-Ala-S-SyrB1 reaction), A318 does not decay in the1,000-s upper time limit of the stopped-flow apparatus. This stability allows the intermediateto be prepared in high yield by exposure of a solution of the SyrB2\u2022substrates complex toO2(g) rather than by the more common procedure of rapid mixing with O2-saturated buffer(see Materials and Methods for the procedure and below for its technical advantages).M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of samples prepared in this manner confirm accumulation of the Fe(IV)state in both reactions (Figure 4B, C). For the L-Cpg-S-SyrB1 reaction, the Fe(IV)-associatedM\u00f6ssbauer features can be analyzed as two doublets with a \u223c1:5 intensity ratio (Figure S1,spectrum F) and essentially the same parameters (\u03b41 = 0.32 mm/s, \u0394EQ1 = 1.12 mm/s and \u03b42= 0.25 mm/s, \u0394EQ2 = 0.69 mm/s) observed for the intermediate formed with the L-Thr-and L-Matthews et al.Page 11Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript Val-appended substrates. Immediately after the direct oxygenation procedure, the intermediatestate constitutes 88 \u00b1 5% of the 57Fe, giving a concentration of > 1 mM. The spectra of samplesfrozen at various times during the subsequent incubation of the solution in air at 0 \u00b0C implythat the state decays very slowly (t1/2 \u223c 1.8 h). With the L-Ala-S-SyrB1 substrate, theintermediate accumulates to similarly high levels (90 \u00b1 5%). In this case, the M\u00f6ssbauerfeatures can be satisfactorily accounted for by a single quadrupole doublet with \u03b4 = 0.27 mm/s and \u0394EQ = 0.94 mm/s (not shown), but the asymmetry of the high-energy line and increasedwidth of both lines (\u223c 0.30 mm/s) suggest that two complexes might still be present. If so,their parameters are perturbed relative to the aforementioned cases, resulting in diminishedspectral resolution (Figure S1, spectrum E; Table S1). Upon subsequent prolonged incubation,the quadrupole doublet features of the intermediate decay with a t1/2 of 30 min. In the reactionsof both substrates, features characteristic of high-spin Fe(III), rather than the high-spin Fe(II)generated upon productive halogenation, grow in as the intermediate decays (Figure 4B, C).Thus, with the methyl chlorination target removed or modified so as to strengthen the C\u2013Hbond, the chloroferryl state decays by univalent reduction. The fact that the intermediate is lessstable when it is formed with L-Ala-S-SyrB1 than when it is formed with L-Cpg-S-SyrB1suggests that packing of the side chain in the active site may be important not only for optimalST but also for optimal protection of the high-valent complex(es) against unproductive decaypathways. 3. Characterization of the Stabilized Chloroferry Intermediate by EXAFS SpectroscopyThe unprecedented stability of the SyrB2 chloroferryl state2 effectively removes severalchallenges inherent to the use of the rapid-mix/freeze-quench method to prepare suchintermediates for structural characterization (e.g., concentration limits imposed by the limitedsolubility of O2, diminished accumulation caused by competition from the decay process,dilution of the intermediate by the freeze-quench cryo-solvent, and poor transmittance of thepacked powder samples produced by the method). It thereby potentially permits application ofbiophysical methods requiring higher concentration or purity (e.g., nuclear resonancevibrational spectroscopy), optical-quality samples (e.g., magnetic circular dichroismspectroscopy) or extreme stability (e.g., x-ray crystallography). EXAFS spectroscopy is onesuch high-resolution structural technique that benefits from samples of high concentration and,more importantly, purity. Although EXAFS spectroscopy was previously applied to thebromoferryl state of the CytC3 halogenase to determine Fe\u2013oxo and Fe\u2013Br distances (24),neither the presence of the Cl\u2013Fe=O unit nor either bond distance has been reported for themore relevant chloroferryl state. To begin to capitalize on the virtues of the SyrB2 systemrevealed above, we prepared the chloroferryl intermediate state at high concentration and purityfor characterization by EXAFS. The smaller CytC2 carrier protein was used for ST, the L-Cpgamino acid was appended for maximum intermediate stability, and the direct oxygenationprocedure was used to exceed the concentration limit imposed by O2 solubility. The M\u00f6ssbauerspectrum of a parallel sample (Figure S1, spectrum G) demonstrates accumulation of the Fe(IV) state to 90% of the total 57Fe and a concentration of \u223c 1.8 mM.The K-edge XAS data are shown in Figure 5. The absorption-edge energy for the samplesenriched in the chloroferryl state is \u223c 1.9 eV greater than for the samples of the reactant state(7122.8 eV compared to 7120.9 eV), demonstrating the greater binding energy of the 1selectron in the Fe(IV) complex(es). The samples of the intermediate also exhibit a (\u223c 2.5 fold)more intense pre edge feature, which arises from the 1s to 3d transition and is commonlyobserved for ferryl species as a consequence of the axial symmetry imposed by the dominantoxo ligand (45,46). The data for the reactant state could be fit well by inclusion of 2 shells ofscatterers, one with 5 O/N ligands at 2.12 \u212b and the second with a single Cl ligand at 2.40 \u212b(Table 1). This analysis is consistent with the crystal structure of SyrB2, although thestructurally characterized protein did not have the substrate bound. Two other geometries gaveMatthews et al.Page 12Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 May 26.N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript N IH -PA Author Manuscript slightly diminished fit errors, but they included 2 shells of O/N ligands at distances too similarto be resolved with the resolution of the data (0.159 \u212b). The data for the samples of theintermediate state were fit best by inclusion of 3 shells of scatterers: one short O/N ligand at1.66 \u212b (the oxo group), four O/N ligands at 2.12 \u212b, and one Cl ligand at 2.31 \u212b. Importantly,the short O/N and Cl scatterers were both required for optimal fits (Table 2). The distancesagree well with the geometry-optimized models, which include a Fe-Cl bond of 2.35 \u212b, a Fe-O bond of 1.64 \u212b, and an Fe-O/N shell ranging from 1.91 \u212b to 2.10 \u212b. They are also verysimilar to the bond lengths in the only structurally characterized synthetic chloroferryl complex(47). For both SyrB2 redox states, analysis of Fourier-filtered data yielded results essentiallyidentical with those obtained by analysis of the unfiltered data (Tables S1 and S2 in SupportingInformation). 4. ConclusionsSubstrate triggering, a phenomenon previously shown to occur in several Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases and thought to protect the enzymes by properly timing the formation oftheir potently oxidizing ferryl intermediates, is also operant in the structurally andmechanistically related aliphatic halogenase, SyrB2. The complete tri-modular substrate, withcarrier protein (SyrB1), covalently attached PPant cofactor, and thioester-appended aminoacid, is required for ST of rapid chloroferryl intermediate formation. The data suggest that thecarrier protein provides the most important binding determinants, delivering the amino acidinto the SyrB2 active site, where specific contacts between the halogenase and its substrate'sside chain optimally condition its Fe(II) cofactor for O2 activation [at least in part by promotingdissociation of a weakly bound water ligand (8)]. SyrB2 is triggered by its substrate and protectsits high-valent intermediate from side reactions to unprecedented extents. The large triggeringfactor, tolerance for even profound chemical modifications of the side chain, andunprecedented efficiency of containment of the chloroferryl intermediate present opportunitiesfor structural characterization, which we have begun to exploit in this study, measuring Fe\u2013oxo and Fe\u2013Cl distances by EXAFS spectroscopy and showing that these distances areconsistent with DFT-derived models. With the abilities to accumulate the intermediate to highconcentrations (perhaps > 5 mM), freeze-trap it so as to obtain ideal sample properties, andstabilize it for hours, application of additional structural techniques, even those with moresevere technical demands, may now be undertaken.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.REFERENCES 1.

        "study, we have tested for and defined structural determinants of substrate triggering (ST) in thehalogenase, SyrB2, from the syringomycin E biosynthetic NRPS of Pseudomonas syringae B301D.As for other halogen ases, the substrate of SyrB2 is complex, consisting of L-Thr tethered via thioesterlinkage to a covalently bound phosphopantetheine (PPant) cofactor of a carrier protein, SyrB1.Without an appended amino acid, SyrB1 does not trigger formation of the chloroferryl intermediatestate in SyrB2, even in the presence of free L-Thr or its analogues, but SyrB1 charged either by L-Thror by any of several non-native amino acids does trigger the reaction by as much as 8,000-fold (forL-Thr-S-SyrB1). Triggering efficacy is sensitive to the structures of both the amino acid and the carrierprotein, being diminished by 5\u201320-fold when the native L-Thr is replaced by another amino acid andby \u223c 40-fold when SyrB1 is replaced by a heterologous carrier protein, CytC2. The directing effectof the carrier protein and consequent tolerance for profound modifications to the target amino acidallow the chloroferryl state to be formed in the presence of substrates that perturb the ratio of its twoputative coordination isomers, lack the target C-H bond (L-Ala-S-SyrB1), or contain a C-H bond ofenhanced strength (L-cyclopropylglycyl-S-SyrB1). For the latter two cases, the SyrB2 chloroferrylstate so formed exhibits unprecedented stability (t1/2 = 30 \u2013 110 min at 0 \u00b0C), can be trapped in highconcentration and purity by manual freezing without a cryo-solvent, and represents an ideal targetfor structural characterization. As initial steps toward this goal, extended x-ray absorption finestructure (EXAFS) spectroscopy has been used to determine the Fe-O and Fe-Cl distances and densityfunctional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to confirm that the measured distances areconsistent with the anticipated structure of the",
        "intermediate.INTRODUCTION",
        "The Fe(II)-and \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases activate O2 at mononuclear non-hemeFe(II) centers to catalyze hydroxylation, desaturation, cyclization, and isomerization reactions(1-4). In each case, the two-electron oxidation of the substrate is coupled to oxidativedecarboxylation of the co-substrate, \u03b1 ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG), to CO2 and succinate, providingthe two additional reducing equivalents needed to balance the four-electron reduction of O2.In the most extensively studied members of the family, the Fe(II) cofactors are similarlycoordinated by a conserved (His)2(Asp/Glu) \u201cfacial triad\u201d of protein ligands (5,6). Bidentatecoordination of \u03b1KG leaves one remaining position in the octahedral coordination sphere towhich O2 can add to be activated (2,7,8). As first proposed by Hanauske-Abel and G\u00fcnzler (inwhat the first author later termed the \u201cHAG\u201d mechanism (9)), this step leads to formation ofa hydrogen-abstracting iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate (Scheme 1A) (10). In the reactionsof two family members, taurine:\u03b1KG dioxygenase (TauD) and a prolyl-4-hydroxlase (P4H)from Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1), the ferryl complexes have beendirectly demonstrated (11,12). The kinetics of the ferryl intermediates were monitored instopped-flow experiments by their ultraviolet absorption (at \u223c 320 nm) and in freeze-quenchM\u00f6ssbauer experiments by their quadrupole doublets with low isomer shift (\u223c 0.3 mm/s).Large substrate deuterium kinetic isotope effects (2H-KIEs) on decay of the intermediates(kH/kD = 50-60) showed that they both abstract hydrogen (12,13). The TauD intermediate wasfurther characterized by resonance Raman (rR) (14) and extended x-ray absorption finestructure (EXAFS) spectroscopies (15), which confirmed the presence of the Fe=O unit.According to the HAG mechanism, the ferryl complex abstracts a hydrogen atom (H\u2022), andsubsequent \u201crebound\u201d (16) of a hydroxyl radical equivalent from the resultant Fe(III)-OHcomplex to the substrate radical yields the hydroxylated product and Fe(II) form of the cofactor(Scheme 1A)",
        "(10).SyrB2 from the syringomycin E biosynthetic system in Pseudomonas syringae B301D wasrecently characterized as the founding member of a sub-family of \u03b1KG-dependent oxygenasesthat effect oxidative halogenation (mono-and di-chlorination and bromination) of unactivatedcarbon centers in the biosyntheses of natural products by non-ribosomal peptide",

        "(NRPSs) (17-21). The structure of the enzyme determined by x-ray crystallography revealedthe carboxylate ligand from the canonical facial triad to be absent, replaced in the proteinsequence by a non-coordinating alanine and in the Fe(II) coordination sphere by a halide ion(22). A mechanism derived from the HAG dioxygenase mechanism was proposed for SyrB2and other aliphatic halogenases (Scheme 1B). The crucial features are, first, the formation ofa haloferryl [X-Fe(IV)=O; X = Cl, Br] intermediate that abstracts H\u2022 from the substrate and,second, the rebound of the halogen atom, rather than the hydroxyl radical, from the resultantX-Fe(III)-OH complex to the substrate radical (22). The proposed C-H-cleaving intermediatewas subsequently (i) detected in the reaction of the halogenase, CytC3 (from the cytotrienin Aproducer, Streptomyces sp. RK95-74; Scheme 2B), (ii) shown by the large substrate 2H-KIEon its decay to abstract hydrogen, and (iii) demonstrated by EXAFS spectroscopy to have theexpected X-Fe=O unit (for X = Br) (23,24). Interestingly, the haloferryl intermediate state wasshown by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy to comprise two distinct Fe(IV) complexes, which werespeculatively assigned as rapidly interconverting coordination isomers. It was suggested thatthis isomerism could reflect conformational dynamics required for the alternative (halogenrather than hydroxyl) rebound",
        "(23).An important characteristic of several (perhaps most) \u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases is \u201csubstratetriggering\u201d (ST), a marked activation of the Fe(II) cofactor for reaction with O2 caused bybinding of the substrate (1-3). By disfavoring or preventing formation of the potently oxidizingferryl complex until its oxidation target is in place, ST is thought to protect the enzyme againstdeleterious auto-oxidation reactions. For TauD, taurine binding was shown to trigger the O2reaction by \u223c 1000-fold (25,26). It is possible that the untriggered (lacking taurine) reactionmight even proceed by a different mechanism, as no evidence could be obtained foraccumulation of the ferryl complex under these conditions (1,",
        "26).Pioneering work of Solomon and co-workers showed first for clavaminate synthase andsubsequently for other family members (including TauD) that conversion of the Fe(II) site from6-coordinate (6C) to 5 coordinate (5C), making available the site to which O2 adds, is at leastpartly responsible for the ST phenomenon (2,7,8,27). It is thought that a protein conformationalchange associated with substrate binding promotes dissociation of a water ligand, although theresultant 6C \u2192 5C change may in some cases be incomplete (8). To our knowledge, ST hasnot been systematically examined for the halogenases, although the partial 6C \u2192 5C changeupon addition of substrate was also observed for CytC3 (8). The substrate of a halogenase iscomplex and tri-modular, consisting of an amino acid (L-Thr for the case of SyrB2) tetheredvia thioester linkage to a phosphopantetheine (PPant) cofactor, which is in turn covalentlyattached via one of its Ser residues to a carrier protein (SyrB1) (Scheme 2) (17,19-21). In thisstudy, we tested for ST in SyrB2, finding: (i) that, indeed, reaction of the SyrB2\u2022Fe(II)\u2022\u03b1KG\u2022Cl-complex with O2 is 8,000 times faster in the presence of the native substrate (L-Thr-S-SyrB1) than in either the absence of the carrier protein or the presence of SyrB1 with itsPPant module not charged by an amino acid (HS-SyrB1); and (ii) that only in the former casedoes the chloroferryl complex demonstrably accumulate. Contacts between the halogenase andboth the carrier protein module and the amino acid module appear to contribute to ST, butforms of SyrB1 charged by a non-native amino acid still trigger by as much as \u223c 1300-fold,and the L-Thr-charged form of the heterologous carrier protein, CytC2 (the carrier protein forthe CytC3 halogenase), triggers by 300-fold. The tolerance for modifications to both terminalmodules of the substrate affords several unique opportunities to explore the structure of thechloroferryl state, the nature of its conformational isomerism, and the mechanism by which iteffects aliphatic chlorination. For example, variation of the amino acid is shown to allow theratio of the two constituent complexes to be varied from \u223c 4:1 for L-Thr-S-SyrB1 to \u223c 1:5 forL-cyclopropylglycine-S-SyrB1, a tool that should be useful for exploring the structuraldistinction between them by spectroscopy and computation. Conversely, use of the 10-kDaheterologous carrier protein, CytC2 (the carrier protein for CytC3), in place of the 66",

        "SyrB1 allows the O2-reactive SyrB2\u2022substrates complex, and thus potentially the chloroferrylintermediate, to be prepared at concentrations approaching the solubility of SyrB2 itself (> 5mM). Most importantly, the directing effect of the carrier protein permits the chloroferryl stateto be formed with drastically modified amino acids that either lack the target C-H bond (L-Ala-S-SyrB1) or have a C-H bond of enhanced strength (L-cyclopropylglycyl-S-SyrB1). The SyrB2chloroferryl state so formed is remarkably stable (t1/2 = 30 \u2013 110 min at 0 \u00b0C), can be trappedin high concentration and purity by manual freezing without a cryo-solvent, and represents anideal target for structural characterization. We use EXAFS spectroscopy on samples of thechloroferryl state prepared in this manner to obtain two crucial metrics, the Fe\u2013O and Fe\u2013Cldistances, for the SyrB2 intermediate. These metric parameters are consistent with thoseobtained by density functional theory (DFT)",

The \u0394A412 signal (\u03b5 = 13,600 M-1cm-1) from the free thiols in the carrier proteins(one Cys residue in SyrB1 and none in CytC2) is first enhanced by attachment of the PPant(giving two total thiols in SyrB1 and one in CytC2) and subsequently diminished due toprotection by the amino acid during the charging reaction. The change in the intensity of thesignal was used to calculate the extent of PPant attachment and amino acid charging. Treatmentof an ATP-depleted reaction mixture with the thioesterase, TycF (32), at room temperatureafter charging by the amino acid resulted in a complete regain of the absorbance that was lostduring the charging step, confirming the specificity of the Ellman's",

        "SyrB2Testing for Chloroferryl Intermediate Accumulation and ST in SyrB2\u2014To test forST in SyrB2, its reaction with O2 in the presence of the complete, native substrate, SyrB1charged by L-Thr (L-Thr-S-SyrB1) (17), was first examined. Upon mixing of an anoxic solutioncontaining SyrB2, Fe(II), \u03b1KG, Cl-, and L-Thr-S-SyrB1 at 5 \u00b0C with O2 saturated buffer, theabsorbance at 318 nm (A318) rises to a maximum with an apparent first-order rate constant,kobs, of 48 \u00b1 4 s-1 (with O2 in excess at \u223c 0.9 mM) and then decays to its initial value withkobs = (71 \u00b1 6) \u00d7 10-3 s-1 (Figure 1A, black trace). Analogy to previous results on TauD, P4H,and CytC3 would suggest that the A318 transient reflects accumulation and decay of thehydrogen abstracting-chloroferryl intermediate state. This inference is confirmed by the 2H-KIE of \u223c 20 on the decay phase (Figure 1A, gray trace) seen upon use of L-Thr-S-SyrB1 havingall five exchange-inert hydrogen atoms of the L-Thr (including those in the target side chainmethyl group) substituted by deuterium (d5-L-Thr). More directly, the 4.2-K/zero-fieldM\u00f6ssbauer spectra of freeze-quenched samples from the reaction (Figure 2A) exhibit transientfeatures that can be analyzed as a pair of partially resolved quadrupole doublets with parameters\u03b41 = 0.30 mm/s, \u0394EQ,1 = 1.09 mm/s (red line in Figure 2A) and \u03b42 = 0.23 mm/s, \u0394EQ,2 = 0.76mm/s (blue line). The similarity of these parameters to those determined previously for thechloroferryl state in CytC3 (23) confirms the accumulation of the corresponding state in theSyrB2 reaction. The presence of two doublets at an intensity ratio that is essentially constantwith time (at \u223c 4:1) suggests that, as in the CytC3 reaction, the SyrB2 intermediate statecomprises two Fe(IV) complexes in equilibrium. Although the \u223c 4:1 intensity ratio in SyrB2is different from the \u223c 1:1 ratio seen in CytC3, results presented below show that the SyrB2ratio varies with the amino acid that is tethered to SyrB1. From the sum of the contributionsof the two Fe(IV)-associated doublets to the total absorption area of each M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum,the kinetics of the SyrB2 intermediate state were determined (black circles in Figure 1A). Theycoincide well with the \u0394A318-versus time",

UV absorption develops8,000-fold less rapidly and is stable rather than transient (on the 1,000-s maximum timescaleof the stopped-flow apparatus). Moreover, the slowly developing absorption is not associatedwith the chloroferryl intermediate state, as the 4.2-K/zero-field M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum of asample freeze-quenched at approximately the half-time of the rise phase lacks the signature ofthe intermediate (Spectrum A in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). At completion ofthe rise phase, features characteristic of high-spin Fe(III) species dominate the M\u00f6ssbauerspectrum (Figure S2).

In short, the complete, native substrate, L-Thr-S-SyrB1, triggers reactionof SyrB2 with O2 by 8,000-fold and may even change the reaction mechanism [in light of thefact that (i) the chloroferryl state does not accumulate and (ii) Fe(III) rather than Fe(II) productsare generated in the \u2018untriggered\u2019 reaction], the tethered amino acid is necessary for ST, andneither the free amino acid nor a carboxylate-neutralized analogue of it has any triggeringeffect. The incompetence of free amino acids for ST may be partly (if not completely)responsible for their reported failure to be halogenated (20, 21, 38, 39). The factor by whichSyrB2 is triggered by its native substrate is greater than any yet observed for a member of thisenzyme family. By comparison, TauD is triggered by 1,000-fold (25, 26), PBCV-1 P4H by500-fold (12), and CytC3 by 40-fold under similar reaction",
        "conditions.Dependence of ST Efficacy on the Structure of the Amino Acid Side Chain\u2014Having established that ST is operant in SyrB2 and that the tethered amino acid is essential forit, we next addressed whether the structure of the amino acid, or merely the fact that it caps thePPant as thioester, is more important for ST. SyrB1 species representing (i) replacement of thehydroxyl group of the L-Thr sidechain by either hydrogen (L-Aba-S-SyrB1, where L-Aba denotesL-2-aminobutyric acid) or a second methyl (L-Val-S-SyrB1), (ii) replacement of the targetmethyl by hydrogen (L-Ser-S-SyrB1), and (iii) replacement of both \u03b2 substituents by hydrogens(L-Ala-S-SyrB1) were tested for ST efficacy under the same reaction conditions as for the nativesubstrate. Qualitatively, each of the four non-native amino acids triggers the O2 reaction whentethered to SyrB1 (Figure 1B, D). In every case, UV absorption develops with a kobs of 2 \u2013 8s-1, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the reaction with HS-SyrB1. For the twosubstrates retaining the \u03b3-methyl halogenation target (L-Aba-S-SyrB1 and L-Val-S-SyrB1), theattribution of the transient absorption to the chloroferryl intermediate state is confirmed by twolines of evidence. For both substrates, large 2H-KIEs on the decay phases (Figure 1B, comparelight and dark traces) demonstrate that the intermediate abstracts hydrogen. For L-Val-S-SyrB1,M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of freeze-quench samples (Figure 2B and C, yielding blue circles in Figure1B) from the reactions of both unlabeled and deuterium-labeled substrates demonstrate bothaccumulation of the chloroferryl state and the coincidence of its kinetics with the A318transients. For the substrates lacking the \u03b3-methyl halogenation target (L-Ala-S-SyrB1 and L-Ser-S-SyrB1), the UV absorption fails to decay on the maximum timescale (1,000 s) of thestopped-flow apparatus (Figure 1D, green trace). This observation is consistent with theexpectation that the absence of the target hydrogen should stabilize the chloroferryl state to aneven greater extent than deuterium substitution, as is verified and discussed in more detail ina later",
        "section.Quantitatively, the triggering efficacies (as assessed by kobs for chloroferryl intermediateformation under a common set of reaction conditions) of the four non-native substrates are 5\u201324-fold less than that of the native substrate. In principle, the diminished efficacy could reflectdiminished binding affinity for the non-native substrate or less profound activation of the Fe(II) cofactor toward reaction with O2 in the complex (or a combination of the two). To addressthis issue, variation of the concentration of one of the non-native substrates (L-Val-S-SyrB1)was carried out. The value of kobs for the formation phase extracted by regression analysis ofthe traces in Figure 3A increases by less than 50% as the concentration of L-Val-S-SyrB1 isincreased by a factor of four. This kinetic order of much less than one implies saturation ofSyrB2 by the non-native substrate at the higher ratios. If the dependence of kobs on [L-Val-S-SyrB1] is treated as a hyperbolic function, the limiting y-value (3.7 s-1) is less than one tenththe kobs for the native substrate reaction at a L-Thr-S-SyrB1:SyrB2 ratio of 3 (which issaturating). This analysis implies that the identity of the amino acid affects the O2 reactivityof the complex, in addition to any effect on affinity that it may have.

It is possible that even further truncation of thenative L-Thr (e.g., Gly or perhaps even acetyl) might be tolerated without loss of this side-chain-independent contribution to ST. We attempted to test Gly but found that the adenylationmodule of SyrB1 was unable to charge the sidechain-less amino acid onto the PPant of thecarrier",
        "domain.Dependence of ST Efficacy on the Identity of the Carrier Protein\u2014Havingestablished (i) that ST is operant in SyrB2, (ii) that attachment of any amino acid to the PPantof SyrB1 is quantitatively most important for it, and (iii) that its efficacy is still moderatelysensitive to the structure of the amino acid side chain, we next asked whether the structure ofthe carrier domain impacts ST efficacy. L-Thr was appended to CytC2, the carrier protein forthe CytC3 halogenase from the cytotrienin biosynthetic system (Scheme 2B) (29). WhereasSyrB1 comprises an adenylation (A) domain to activate the amino acid for attachment to thePPant on its thiolation (T) domain (Scheme 2A), CytC2 is a stand-alone thiolation domain(which is charged with the amino acid by the separate adenylation protein, CytC1) and isconsequently smaller (11 kDa including the affinity tag) than SyrB1 (66 kDa), a characteristicpotentially useful for accumulation of the intermediate state to very high concentrations (seebelow). L-Thr-S-CytC2 triggers formation of the chloroferryl intermediate state in SyrB2(Figure 1C). Quantitatively, it is less effective than the native substrate by \u223c 40-fold at thesame concentration. However, the linear dependence on [L-Thr-S-CytC2] of kobs for thedevelopment phase of the A318 transient (Figure 3B) suggests that the diminished ST efficacyof the substrate containing the native amino acid tethered to the heterologous carrier proteincould reflect primarily a diminished affinity for the halogenase. Together, the data suggest thatthe carrier protein provides the more important binding determinants for complex formation,delivering the amino acid to the halogenase active site, and that specific contacts with the sidechain then condition the active site in a manner that further activates for O2 addition andchloroferryl intermediate",
        "formation.Effects of the Side Chain on the Chloroferryl State and its C\u2013H CleavageEfficiency\u2014The amino acid side chain exerts three additional, intriguing effects on thehalogenase reaction. The first is on the distribution of the intermediate state between its twoconstituent complexes, as reflected by the relative contributions of the two partially resolvedM\u00f6ssbauer quadrupole doublets. Whereas the ratio is \u223c 4:1 with the native substrate (Figure2A), it is \u223c 1:1 with L-Val-S-SyrB1. With the L-cyclopropylglycine substrate (L-Cpg-S-SyrB1)discussed in the next section, the ratio shifts even further to \u223c 1:5. The ability to change thecomposition of the intermediate state potentially provides a tool to understand the structuraldistinction between its constituent complexes. It also contrasts with previous observations onCytC3, wherein the chloroferryl state was shown to have a \u223c 1:1 ratio of the two putativecoordination isomers when formed with either L-Aba and L-Val-charged CytC2 (23). Thesecond effect is on the electronic structure of the iron in the chloroferryl state, as reflected bythe M\u00f6ssbauer parameters. In particular, the quadrupole splitting parameter (\u0394EQ) ofchloroferryl species 1 prepared with substrates having two non-hydrogen substituents on C\u03b2(i.e. L-Thr-S-SyrB1, L-Val-S-SyrB1, and L-Cpg-S-SyrB1) is larger than for the complex preparedwith substrates having only one (L-Aba-S-SyrB1) or no C\u03b2 substituent (L-Ala-S-SyrB1) (1.09\u20131.14 mm/s compared to 0.99 mm/s). The third effect is on the kinetics of decay of thechloroferryl state. The A318 kinetic traces for the L-Val-S-SyrB1 and L-Aba-S-SyrB1 reactions(Figure 1B) show that decay of the chloroferryl state to the Fe(II) product state by C\u2013H cleavageand (presumably) chlorination is at least 10-fold faster for the substrate lacking the second \u03b3methyl group, despite the fact that the target C\u2013H bonds are expected to have similar homolyticbond dissociation energies (BDEs; listed on left of Figure 1).

The origins of these kinetic effects are not clear, but it is possible that the absenceof the second substituent to C\u03b2 (hydroxyl or methyl) to anchor the side chain within the SyrB2active site allows the target hydrogen to achieve greater proximity or more frequent closeapproach to the chloroferryl oxygen, a situation expected to favor both more rapid C\u2013Hcleavage and a larger 2H-KIE",

        "SyrB2Unprecedented Protection of Chloroferryl State by SyrB2\u2014Figures 1B and 2Cillustrate that the chloroferryl intermediate in SyrB2 decays remarkably slowly [k = (3.1 \u00b1 0.3)\u00d7 10-3 s-1] in its reaction with the deuterium-labeled L-Val-S-SyrB1 substrate. Indeed, the half-life of almost three minutes (at 5 \u00b0C) is the longest yet observed for a non-heme ferryl enzymeintermediate (4, 11-13, 23, 41).2 Moreover, the spectra in Figure 3A illustrate that, despite itslong lifetime, the intermediate decays primarily (> 70%) to Fe(II) products, as occurs inproductive halogenation (which was not explicitly demonstrated). This observation contrastswith previous results on CytC3, in which decay of the intermediate in the presence of thedeuterium-labeled substrate, 4,4,4-d3-L-Aba-S-CytC2, was seen to yield more Fe(III) complex(es), suggesting that unproductive univalent reduction of the intermediate competes effectivelywith the productive pathway initiated by deuterium abstraction (23). The implication is thatSyrB2 suppresses the alternative decay pathway(s) to a greater extent than does CytC3. Thissuppression is also much greater than for TauD, the only other member of the family for whichdata are available to assess this issue (26). Evidence suggests that, in TauD, a specific tyrosineresidue (Y73) near the Fe cofactor can be oxidized to a radical, providing a potential source ofthe electron for univalent decay of the ferryl complex (43). SyrB2 possesses multiple tyrosineresidues in similar proximity to its cofactor. Why these Y residues do not reduce thechloroferryl state more efficiently (i.e., how SyrB2 prevents this undesired side reaction) is anintriguing question for future",
        "investigation.Extending the Lifetime of the Chloroferryl State by Target Removal orModification\u2014The unusually effective suppression of alternative, unproductive pathwaysfor decay of the chlorinating intermediate, combined with the modularity of the SyrB2 substrateand tolerance for significant side chain modifications, suggested the opportunity for furtherstabilization of the intermediate. To explore the limit of stabilization of the chloroferrylcomplex by SyrB2, we tested two alternative substrates, the aforementioned L-Ala-S-SyrB1and L-Cpg-S-SyrB1. The former substrate lacks the chlorination target altogether and the latterpossesses a stronger target C\u2013H bond (BDE of \u223c106 kcal/mol (44)) that we anticipated mightbe too strong for the chloroferryl intermediate to cleave (see Figure 1). In each reaction,A318 develops with kinetics (Figure 1D, solid traces) similar to those observed for the L-Valsubstrate (Figure 1B, dark blue trace). Consistent with the desired stabilization of theintermediate (and as noted above for the L-Ala-S-SyrB1 reaction), A318 does not decay in the1,000-s upper time limit of the stopped-flow apparatus. This stability allows the intermediateto be prepared in high yield by exposure of a solution of the SyrB2\u2022substrates complex toO2(g) rather than by the more common procedure of rapid mixing with O2-saturated buffer(see Materials and Methods for the procedure and below for its technical advantages).M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of samples prepared in this manner confirm accumulation of the Fe(IV)state in both reactions (Figure 4B, C). For the L-Cpg-S-SyrB1 reaction, the Fe(IV)-associatedM\u00f6ssbauer features can be analyzed as two doublets with a \u223c1:5 intensity ratio (Figure S1,spectrum F) and essentially the same parameters (\u03b41 = 0.32 mm/s, \u0394EQ1 = 1.12 mm/s and \u03b42= 0.25 mm/s, \u0394EQ2 = 0.69 mm/s) observed for the intermediate formed with the L-Thr-and",

        "Val-appended substrates. Immediately after the direct oxygenation procedure, the intermediatestate constitutes 88 \u00b1 5% of the 57Fe, giving a concentration of > 1 mM. The spectra of samplesfrozen at various times during the subsequent incubation of the solution in air at 0 \u00b0C implythat the state decays very slowly (t1/2 \u223c 1.8 h). With the L-Ala-S-SyrB1 substrate, theintermediate accumulates to similarly high levels (90 \u00b1 5%). In this case, the M\u00f6ssbauerfeatures can be satisfactorily accounted for by a single quadrupole doublet with \u03b4 = 0.27 mm/s and \u0394EQ = 0.94 mm/s (not shown), but the asymmetry of the high-energy line and increasedwidth of both lines (\u223c 0.30 mm/s) suggest that two complexes might still be present. If so,their parameters are perturbed relative to the aforementioned cases, resulting in diminishedspectral resolution (Figure S1, spectrum E; Table S1). Upon subsequent prolonged incubation,the quadrupole doublet features of the intermediate decay with a t1/2 of 30 min. In the reactionsof both substrates, features characteristic of high-spin Fe(III), rather than the high-spin Fe(II)generated upon productive halogenation, grow in as the intermediate decays (Figure 4B, C).Thus, with the methyl chlorination target removed or modified so as to strengthen the C\u2013Hbond, the chloroferryl state decays by univalent reduction. The fact that the intermediate is lessstable when it is formed with L-Ala-S-SyrB1 than when it is formed with L-Cpg-S-SyrB1suggests that packing of the side chain in the active site may be important not only for optimalST but also for optimal protection of the high-valent complex(es) against unproductive decaypathways.",
        "3. Characterization of the Stabilized Chloroferry Intermediate by EXAFS",
        "SpectroscopyThe unprecedented stability of the SyrB2 chloroferryl state2 effectively removes severalchallenges inherent to the use of the rapid-mix/freeze-quench method to prepare suchintermediates for structural characterization (e.g., concentration limits imposed by the limitedsolubility of O2, diminished accumulation caused by competition from the decay process,dilution of the intermediate by the freeze-quench cryo-solvent, and poor transmittance of thepacked powder samples produced by the method). It thereby potentially permits application ofbiophysical methods requiring higher concentration or purity (e.g., nuclear resonancevibrational spectroscopy), optical-quality samples (e.g., magnetic circular dichroismspectroscopy) or extreme stability (e.g., x-ray crystallography). EXAFS spectroscopy is onesuch high-resolution structural technique that benefits from samples of high concentration and,more importantly, purity. Although EXAFS spectroscopy was previously applied to thebromoferryl state of the CytC3 halogenase to determine Fe\u2013oxo and Fe\u2013Br distances (24),neither the presence of the Cl\u2013Fe=O unit nor either bond distance has been reported for themore relevant chloroferryl state. To begin to capitalize on the virtues of the SyrB2 systemrevealed above, we prepared the chloroferryl intermediate state at high concentration and purityfor characterization by EXAFS. The smaller CytC2 carrier protein was used for ST, the L-Cpgamino acid was appended for maximum intermediate stability, and the direct oxygenationprocedure was used to exceed the concentration limit imposed by O2 solubility. The M\u00f6ssbauerspectrum of a parallel sample (Figure S1, spectrum G) demonstrates accumulation of the Fe(IV) state to 90% of the total 57Fe and a concentration of \u223c 1.8",
        "mM.The K-edge XAS data are shown in Figure 5. The absorption-edge energy for the samplesenriched in the chloroferryl state is \u223c 1.9 eV greater than for the samples of the reactant state(7122.8 eV compared to 7120.9 eV), demonstrating the greater binding energy of the 1selectron in the Fe(IV) complex(es). The samples of the intermediate also exhibit a (\u223c 2.5 fold)more intense pre edge feature, which arises from the 1s to 3d transition and is commonlyobserved for ferryl species as a consequence of the axial symmetry imposed by the dominantoxo ligand (45,46). The data for the reactant state could be fit well by inclusion of 2 shells ofscatterers, one with 5 O/N ligands at 2.12 \u212b and the second with a single Cl ligand at 2.40 \u212b(Table 1). This analysis is consistent with the crystal structure of SyrB2, although thestructurally characterized protein did not have the substrate bound. Two other geometries",

        "slightly diminished fit errors, but they included 2 shells of O/N ligands at distances too similarto be resolved with the resolution of the data (0.159 \u212b). The data for the samples of theintermediate state were fit best by inclusion of 3 shells of scatterers: one short O/N ligand at1.66 \u212b (the oxo group), four O/N ligands at 2.12 \u212b, and one Cl ligand at 2.31 \u212b. Importantly,the short O/N and Cl scatterers were both required for optimal fits (Table 2). The distancesagree well with the geometry-optimized models, which include a Fe-Cl bond of 2.35 \u212b, a Fe-O bond of 1.64 \u212b, and an Fe-O/N shell ranging from 1.91 \u212b to 2.10 \u212b. They are also verysimilar to the bond lengths in the only structurally characterized synthetic chloroferryl complex(47). For both SyrB2 redox states, analysis of Fourier-filtered data yielded results essentiallyidentical with those obtained by analysis of the unfiltered data (Tables S1 and S2 in SupportingInformation).",

        "ConclusionsSubstrate triggering, a phenomenon previously shown to occur in several Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent oxygenases and thought to protect the enzymes by properly timing the formation oftheir potently oxidizing ferryl intermediates, is also operant in the structurally andmechanistically related aliphatic halogenase, SyrB2. The complete tri-modular substrate, withcarrier protein (SyrB1), covalently attached PPant cofactor, and thioester-appended aminoacid, is required for ST of rapid chloroferryl intermediate formation. The data suggest that thecarrier protein provides the most important binding determinants, delivering the amino acidinto the SyrB2 active site, where specific contacts between the halogenase and its substrate'sside chain optimally condition its Fe(II) cofactor for O2 activation [at least in part by promotingdissociation of a weakly bound water ligand (8)]. SyrB2 is triggered by its substrate and protectsits high-valent intermediate from side reactions to unprecedented extents. The large triggeringfactor, tolerance for even profound chemical modifications of the side chain, andunprecedented efficiency of containment of the chloroferryl intermediate present opportunitiesfor structural characterization, which we have begun to exploit in this study, measuring Fe\u2013oxo and Fe\u2013Cl distances by EXAFS spectroscopy and showing that these distances areconsistent with DFT-derived models. With the abilities to accumulate the intermediate to highconcentrations (perhaps > 5 mM), freeze-trap it so as to obtain ideal sample properties, andstabilize it for hours, application of additional structural techniques, even those with moresevere technical demands, may now be",

Substrates include forms of SyrB1 (solidlines) or CytC2 (dashed lines) charged by L-Thr (A and C, black trace), d5-L-Thr (A, gray trace),L-Ala (D, green trace), L-Aba (B, dark pink trace), d6-L-Aba (B, light pink trace), L-Val (B, darkblue trace), d8-L-Val (B, light blue trace) and L-Cpg (D, orange trace). Filled circles indicatethe equivalents of total Fe(IV) determined by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. For the d8-L-Val, L-Cpg, and L-Ala substrates in D, the data points obtained from the M\u00f6ssbauer experiments werefit by the equation for an exponential decay (light blue, green, and orange dashed decay traces)to obtain the values of kobs for decay quoted in the text. *The BDEs indicated in the scheme(44) correspond to the target C-H bond strength of small molecules representative of the aminoacid side chain: 2-propanol, propane, isobutane, and cyclopropane correspond to the side chainsof L-Thr, L-Aba, L-Val, and L-Cpg,",
