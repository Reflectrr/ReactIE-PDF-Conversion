Academic Editor: Kira Weissman Received: 11 April 2016; Accepted: 18 May 2016; Published: 30 May 2016 Abstract: Genome mining is an effective tool used to discover novel natural products from actinomycetes. Genome sequence analysis of Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 revealed the presence of one putative type II polyketide gene cluster (ABX), which may correspond to type II polyketide products including BE-24566B and its chloro-derivatives. The addition of natural humus acid successfully activated the biosynthsis of the abx gene cluster. BE-24566B and its chloro-derivatives, named zunyimycin A, were also detected. The targeted deletion of the polyketide skeleton synthesis genes such as abxp, abxk, and abxs was performed in the wild strain to identify the gene cluster for BE-24566B biosynthesis. Keywords: polyketide synthases; genome mining; genetic engineering; anthrabenzoxocinones; gene cluster 1. Introduction Aromatic polyketides are an important class of natural products with various biological activities, including antibacterial [1,2], antitumor [3,4], and antiviral effects [5]. These polyketides are isolated from plants or microorganisms [6,7]. Actinomycete-derived aromatic polyketides are mainly synthesized by type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) [8,9]. Malonyl-CoA is exclusively used as the extender unit during type II polyketide biosynthesis [10,11]. Starter units vary in different aromatic polyketide biosynthesis pathways, leading to various polyketide backbones [12,13]. Enzymes, such as ketoreductases [14,15], oxygenases [16,17], cyclases [18,19], methyltransferases [20], halogenase [21,22], and glycosyltransferases [23], function on the skeleton to form aromatic structures or provide novel biological activities once the polyketide chains are formed by PKSs [24]. Anthrabenzoxocinones (ABXs) are a group of hexacyclic aromatic ketones with bioactivities, such as antibacterial activity [25\u201327], anti-hypertensive activity [28], cholesterol-reducing activity [27] and nuclear hormone receptors [25]. ABX family members such as (+)-anthrabenzoxocinone ((+)-ABX) (BE-24566B, also named 1.264C,1), (\u00b4)-anthrabenzoxocinone ((\u00b4)-ABX)(1a), as well as Molecules 2016, 21, 711; doi:10.3390/molecules21060711 www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules Molecules 2016, 21, 711 2 of 9 (\u00b4)-bischloroanthrabenzoxocinone ((\u00b4)-BABX)(1b), (Figure 1) have been isolated from Streptomyces sp.

Phylogenetic analysis of identified halogenases from actinomycetes. Molecules 2016, 21, 711 6 of 9 pSIMPLE-18 EcoR V/BAP, were purchased from Takara Biotechnology Company (Dalian, China) and used to construct a sub-clone library. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, DNA end blunting kination ligation, and PCR kits were also purchased from the same company. The primers used for gene cloning and DNA sequencing were synthesized by Beijing Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The DNA gel extraction kit was obtained from Axygen Biosciences, Inc. (Hangzhou, China). 4.2. DNA Isolation, Manipulation, and Sequencing Genomic DNA was isolated from Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 by using the standard method described by Hopwood [32]. Molecular manipulation was conducted according to the standard methods described by Sambrook and Russel [33]. Plasmid and fosmid sequencing was performed on the 3730xl DNA analyzer at Beijing Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd. by using the shotgun cloning strategy. The pCC2/pEpiFOS forward and reverse primers (sequences in the CopyControl protocol) were used to sequence the fosmid ends. Moreover, the M13 primers were used to sequence the subclone ends. Draft genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 was performed on Illumina HiSeq2000 (BGI Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Shenzhen, China) by using a proprietary reversible terminator-based strategy. 4.3. The Genomic Library and Subclone Library Construction and Screening The full-length sequence of the predicted lobophorin biosynthetic gene cluster was obtained by constructing the genomic library of Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 in CopyControl pCC2FOS according to the manufacturer1s instructions. The library contains more than 6000 clones with approximately 40 kb inserted genomic DNA fragments. The genomic library was screened through colony PCR with primer pairs designed based on the nucleic acid sequences of abxH according to the results of the predictive analysis of the draft genome sequencing. The end of the positive clone was sequenced to confirm that the clone was located in the abx cluster. Next-round screening was performed with primer pairs designed based on the end sequences of the last round of screening results until three positive clones overlapping one another were obtained. Accordingly, 1 \u00b5g of fosmid DNA was fragmented using an ultrasonic cell disruptor under 200 W for 1 s on ice. DNA fragments within 2\u20134 kb size were recovered using the AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit. The fragments were cloned into pSIMPLE-18 EcoR V/BAP vector to construct subclone libraries after being end blunted and 51-phosphorylated. PCR screening was performed using sequence-specific primers designed based on the end sequences of each gap. The positive clones were then sequenced with M13-47F/M13-48R and specific primers. 4.4. Analysis of the Anthrabenzoxocinone Biosynthetic Gene Cluster A 16.5-kb contiguous DNA segment was obtained by subcloned library sequencing and deposited in GenBank under accession number KU243130. The sequence was uploaded to the antiSMASH website [34] and used to determine gene content and order. The open reading frames proposed for the biosynthesis pathway of the anthrabenzoxocinone skeleton, post modification, and regulation were deduced based on functional gene analysis. The analysis was performed by comparing the sequence homology with its homologous clusters by using BlastP. These clusters were found by antiSMASH. The comparative analysis and the global rearrangement structure of the two anthrabenzoxocinone biosynthetic gene clusters were conducted using Mauve software [35]. 4.5. Inactivation of the Anthrabenzoxocinone Biosynthetic Gene Cluster A 2.7-kb DNA fragment (from 6165 nt to 8872 nt of KU243130) encoding the ABX polyketide backbone biosynthesis (abxp, abxk, and abxs) was replaced by the kanamycin resistance protein-coding region (AAF85969.1). This region was constructed by PCR, inserted into the pKC1139 plasmid, and transformed into E. coli ET12567. The constructs for gene inactivation were introduced into Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 by conjugal transfer following the procedure of Hopwood2. Disruption was confirmed by PCR analysis. HPLC (LC20AT, Shimadzu, Beijing, China) was used to confirm the abolishment of anthrabenzoxocinone production. Molecules 2016, 21, 711 7 of 9 4.6. Fermentation, Isolation, and Chemical Identification of BE-24566B and Zunyimycin A Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 was cultured using 140 \u02c6 500 mL shake flasks containing 100 mL of ISP 2 agar medium with 10% natural humus acid water extracts and then incubated for 15 d at 28 \u02ddC. The solid culture was mashed and extracted three times with 140 L of ethanol after cultivation. The organic portion was then concentrated in vacuo to remove the solvent. The crude extract was applied to silica gel column chromatography using the CHCl3/MeOH gradient to obtain the crude products. Further purification was conducted using Sephadex LH-20 (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) (MeOH) column and RP-HPLC (Shimadzu SPD-M20A with Xbridge ODS 10 mm \u02c6 150 mm column). Compounds were identified with an HRESI-MS (Waters Xevo G2 QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters corportion, Milford, MA, USA) and NMR (Bruker AV 600 MHz) (Bruker Corporation, Karlsruhe, Germany) analyses. 5. Conclusions In summary, a cryptic anthrabenzoxocinone gene cluster was identified by genome mining. This cluster was successfully activated by adding natural humus acid. Novel halogenated natural products were isolated, characterized, and named as zunyimycin A. Furthermore, the results indicated that halogenase AbxH is responsible for the halogenation reaction of zunyimycin A and may provide potential for the halogenation of natural products.

        "Abstract: Genome mining is an effective tool used to discover novel natural products from actinomycetes. Genome sequence analysis of Streptomyces sp. FJS31-2 revealed the presence of one putative type II polyketide gene cluster (ABX), which may correspond to type II polyketide products including BE-24566B and its chloro-derivatives. The addition of natural humus acid successfully activated the biosynthsis of the abx gene cluster. BE-24566B and its chloro-derivatives, named zunyimycin A, were also detected. The targeted deletion of the polyketide skeleton synthesis genes such as abxp, abxk, and abxs was performed in the wild strain to identify the gene cluster for BE-24566B biosynthesis.",

        "1. Introduction Aromatic polyketides are an important class of natural products with various biological",
        "activities, including antibacterial [1,2], antitumor [3,4], and antiviral effects [5]. These polyketides are isolated from plants or microorganisms [6,7]. Actinomycete-derived aromatic polyketides are mainly synthesized by type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) [8,9]. Malonyl-CoA is exclusively used as the extender unit during type II polyketide biosynthesis [10,11]. Starter units vary in different aromatic polyketide biosynthesis pathways, leading to various polyketide backbones [12,13]. Enzymes, such as ketoreductases [14,15], oxygenases [16,17], cyclases [18,19], methyltransferases [20], halogenase [21,22], and glycosyltransferases [23], function on the skeleton to form aromatic structures or provide novel biological activities once the polyketide chains are formed by PKSs [24]. Anthrabenzoxocinones (ABXs) are a group of hexacyclic aromatic ketones with bioactivities, such",
        "as antibacterial activity [25\u201327], anti-hypertensive activity [28], cholesterol-reducing activity [27] and nuclear hormone receptors [25].
