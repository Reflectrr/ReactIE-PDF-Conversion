The colocaliza-tion of SgcD and SgcD1 along with the other C-1027 production genes assures the availabil-ity of anthranilate for secondary metabolite bio-synthesis. Although it remains unclear what the origin of the C3 unit is and how it is fused to the anthranilate intermediate to form the morpholi-none moiety of 7, the latter is apparently acti-vated as an acyl-S-CoA for attachment to 4 by SgcD6 (Fig. 2B). To support this hypothesis, we inactivated sgcD6 (see SOM). The resultant S. globisporus SB1004 mutant strain complete-ly lost its ability to produce 1 (Fig. 3F). The fact that the biosynthetic building blocks are acti-vated as aminoacy-S-PCP, acyl-S-CoA, and nu-cleotide diphosphosugar; and are attached to the enediyne core by an NRPS condensation en-zyme, an acyltransferase, and a glycosyl trans-ferase, respectively, highlights nature\u2019s effi-ciency and versatility in synthesizing complex molecules. Finally, we inactivated the sgcC hydroxy-lase gene to demonstrate the production of enediyne metabolites by manipulating genes governing C-1027 biosynthesis (see SOM). The resulting S. globisporus SB1006 mutant strain still produces a chromoprotein complex that is biologically active, as judged by bioassay against M. luteus, but is distinct from 1 upon HPLC analysis (Fig. 3G). The resulting enediyne chromophores were isolated (see SOM) and subjected to ESI-MS analysis. 2 exhibited an (M None H)None ion at m/z None 828, consistent with the molecular formula C43H42N3O12Cl, and 8 showed an (M None H) None ion at m/z None 830, consistent with the molecular formula C43H44N3O12Cl. By comparison with 1 and 3, 2 and 8 were deduced to be deshy-droxy-C-1027 (2) and its aromatized product (8) (Fig. 1), as would be predicted according to Fig. 2D. Intriguingly, 2 is at least fivefold more stable than is 1 at 25\u00b0C, in respect to undergo-ing the Bergman cyclization (see SOM), a prop-erty that could be potentially explored in devel-oping C-1027 into a clinically useful drug. We envisage applying methods of combinatorial biosynthesis to the enediyne system for the production of polyketides. References and Notes 1. T. Otani, Y. Minami, T. Marunaka, R. Zhang, M.-Y. Xie, J.

Bachmann,2 Kexue Huang,2 Leonid Fonstein,1 Anne Czisny,1 Ross E. Whitwam,1 Chris M. Farnet,2* Jon S. Thorson1* The enediynes exemplify nature\u2019s ingenuity. We have cloned and characterized the biosynthetic locus coding for perhaps the most notorious member of the nonchromoprotein enediyne family, calicheamicin. This gene cluster contains an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) that is demonstrated to be essential for enediyne biosynthesis. Comparison of the calicheamicin locus with the locus encoding the chromoprotein enediyne C-1027 reveals that the enediyne PKS is highly conserved among these distinct enediyne families. Contrary to previous hypotheses, this suggests that the chromoprotein and nonchromoprotein enediynes are generated by similar biosynthetic pathways. Calicheamicin None1 I (Fig. 1) from Mi-cromonospora echinospora ssp. calichensis is the most prominent member of the non-chromoprotein enediyne family and, as an antitumor agent, is None 5000 times as potent as adriamycin (1). Calicheamicin has two distinct structural regions: The aryltetrasac-charide is composed of a set of carbohy-drate and aromatic units, which delivers the metabolite specifically into the minor groove of DNA (2); the aglycone, or \u201cwar-head,\u201d consists of a highly functionalized bicyclo[7.3.1]tridecadiynene core structure with an allylic trisulfide serving as the initial trigger for warhead cycloaromatiza-tion (3). Once the aryltetrasaccharide is docked to DNA, aromatization of the bicyclo[7.3.1]tridecadiynene core struc-ture, by means of a 1,4-dehydrobenzene-diradical, results in the site-specific oxida-tive double-strand scission of the targeted DNA (4 ). In vitro and in vivo studies con-firm the role of calicheamicin as a DNA-damaging agent and even suggest that cali-cheamicin may favor cleavage at certain chromosomal sites (5). Although this ex-traordinary reactivity has sparked consider-able interest in the pharmaceutical industry, calicheamicin lacks tumor specificity. To circumvent this problem, conjugation of calicheamicin to tumor-specific monoclo-nal antibodies has been used as a targeting strategy.

Although innovative synthetic schemes have been devised for calicheamicin (7), surprisingly little is known about how the warhead is synthesized in nature. Our under-standing of calicheamicin biosynthesis is lim-ited to a set of metabolic labeling experi-ments performed on the related enediyne esperamicin (Fig. S1, compound 5) (8). We report the elucidation of the calicheamicin gene locus from Micromonospora echinos-pora ssp. calichensis, which reveals an un-usual iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) gene (calE8). Disruption of this PKS gene in the calicheamicin-producer Micromonospora provides a strain no longer capable of pro-ducing calicheamicin and suggests that this PKS is critical for enediyne formation. A homolog of this PKS has also been found in the C-1027 gene cluster encoding a member of the structurally distinct chromoprotein enediynes [see companion paper (9)]. In con-trast to previous biosynthetic hypotheses (10), this finding suggests that all enediynes may share a common biosynthetic origin. This work also lays the foundation for future metabolic engineering strategies to generate enediyne analogs. Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013based screening and screens for clones capable of conferring calicheamicin resistance (11), nine overlapping cosmid clones were isolated from a genomic library of M. echinospora ssp. calichensis (NRRL 15839). Although sequence analysis of these clones was consistent with genes encoding aryltetrasaccha-ride biosynthesis and calicheamicin resistance, initial attempts to complete the biosynthetic locus by chromosomal walking were unsuc-cessful (12). To circumvent this problem, we used a shotgun-based approach to finish the calicheamicin locus. DNA sequence analysis revealed 74 open reading frames (ORFs) that span more than 90 kb (Fig. 2). They include 16 genes expected to participate in polyketide con-struction or modification (O1 to O6 and E1 to E10), nine putative regulatory elements (R1 to R9), seven genes associated with membrane transport (T1 to T7), 14 genes consistent with the expected production of four unusual acti-vated nucleotide sugars (S1 to S14), four gly-cosyltransferase genes (G1 to G4), an insertion-al element (IS), and 22 ORFs (U1 to U22) of unknown function (13). The known resistance gene calC (11) was also found to reside near the middle of this locus. Given the long-standing controversy sur-rounding the biosynthetic origin of the enediyne moiety, the polyketide-associated genes within the calicheamicin gene cluster are most relevant to our hypothesis. The two distinct calicheamicin structural elements\u2014 the calicheamicin warhead (Fig. 1, PKS E) and the orsellinic acid derivative found with-in the aryltetrasaccharide (Fig. 1, PKS O)\u2014 are each expected to derive from a separate polyketide precursor. Consistent with this, the calicheamicin locus (Fig. 2, genes calE8 and calO5) encodes two separate iterative type I PKSs (CalE8 and CalO5). CalO5 shows striking similarity (65% identity, 93% similarity) to the PKS (AviM) responsible for orsellinic acid biosynthesis in S. viridochro-mogenes en route to the biosynthesis of the orthosomycin antibiotic avilamycin A (14). Thus, CalO5 likely plays an identical role in the biosynthesis of the calicheamicin aryltet-rasaccharide. In contrast, CalE8 demonstrates the greatest sequence homology to two iter-ative PKSs involved in the biosynthesis of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosa-pentaenoic acid (EPA) in Shewanella (15, 17) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in Moritella marina (16, 17). To confirm that CalE8 is critical to the biosynthesis of calicheamicin in Micromonos-pora, a calE8 gene disruption was constructed by introduction of an apramycin selectable marker (Fig. 3A). The calicheamicin producer M. echinospora is resistant to most antibiotics, and is inherently indisposed to genetic manip-ulation, with a best reported transformation ef-ficiency of 10None7 transformants per microgram DNA (18). In spite of these difficulties, a com-bination of many gene disruption attempts in M. echinospora LL6000 (19) led to nine indepen-dent apramycin-resistant clones. All nine iso-lates mapped consistently with the expected calE8 gene disruption by both PCR fragment amplification and Southern hybridization. The representative hybridization results from two of these clones (pJAW117/LL6000-1 and pJAW117/LL6000-3) are illustrated in Fig. 3B. All nine calE8 disruption mutants and two representative LL6000 isolates were sub-Fig. 1. The structure of the nonchromoprotein enediyne calicheamicin. The enediyne families are typically distinguished by either the number of carbons in the enediyne ring (9-membered versus 10-membered) or by their association, or lack thereof, with an apoprotein (chromoprotein versus nonchromoprotein). With one exception (N1999A), the 9-membered enediynes are chromoprotein enediynes, whereas all 10-membered enediynes to date are nonchromoprotein. The colors correlate the calicheamicin final structure to the functions of genes within the calicheamicin locus (Fig. 2) with the specific PKS structural components designated as PKS E and PKS O.

R E P O R T S 16 AUGUST 2002 VOL 297 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org1174 sequently tested in parallel for calicheamicin production. Extracts from these strains were analyzed by (i) the biochemical induction assay, a modified prophage induction assay used in the original discovery of the cali-cheamicins (20); (ii) the molecular break light assay, a DNA-cleavage assay based on intramolecular fluorescence quenching opti-mized for DNA-cleavage by enediynes (in which femtomolar calicheamicin concentra-tions are detectable) (21); and (iii) high-per-formance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Paternal LL6000 isolates produced 0.5 to 0.8 mg/liter calicheamicin, as expected. In con-trast, the mutant strains with the calE8 gene disrupted were both devoid of any cali-cheamicin, known calicheamicin derivatives, and/or enediyne activity by all three methods of detection (Fig. 3C). Because disruption of PKS O machinery is anticipated to provide a structure lacking PKS O and the terminal rhamnose (similar to that of namenamicin, Fig. S1, compound 6) (22), the result of our calE8 disruption is consistent with elimina-tion of the PKS machinery involved in war-head construction (PKS E) and supports our assignment of CalE8 as this essential entity. Full-length CalE8 is 1919 amino acids in length (Fig. 2). Comparing CalE8 with the known domains of both type I PKS protypes (23) and the PUFA PKSs (which include domains for ketosynthase, KS; acyltrans-ferase, AT; acyl carrier protein, ACP; ketore-ductase, KR; and dehydratase, DH), we find domains as follows: A CalE8 KS domain spans positions 3 to 467; an AT domain spans positions 482 to 905; a KR domain spans positions 1153 to 1414 and a DH domain spans positions 1422 to 1563. Given the sim-ilarity in organization between CalE8 and the PUFA PKSs, the region bridging the AT and KR domains might harbor a putative ACP domain. Yet, in comparison with either the PUFA PKSs or other iterative type I PKSs, there are few obvious ACP markers within this CalE8 domain 1, and thus, this assign-ment is speculative. The COOH-terminal do-main of CalE8 (positions 1582 to 1919, des-ignated TD) also lacks homology to any known PKS or protein. Interestingly, CalE8 shows remarkable sim-ilarity (56% identity and 67% similarity, over-all) in both sequence and organization to an enediyne PKS (SgcE) from the C-1027 biosyn-thetic gene locus (9). C-1027 (Fig. S1, com-pound 4) is a member of structurally distinct chromoprotein enediyne family, previously postulated to derive from a fatty acid precursor (10). In both CalE8 and SgcE, all six domains are evident and four of these six (KS, AT, KR, and DH) are highly conserved. Significant ho-mology divergence is observed in the region bridging the AT and KR domains, a phenome-non common to type I PKSs (23), and the COOH-terminal region (TD) (Fig. 4) (9). In contrast to previous hypotheses, the observed CalE8/SgcE relationship clearly implicates a common PKS progenitor for both the chro-moprotein (C-1027) and nonchromoprotein (calicheamicin) enediynes. In further support of this hypothesis, inspection of representative chromoprotein (C-1027) and nonchromopro-tein (dynemicin and calicheamicin) warheads reveals a common cyclododecylpolyene skele-ton (Fig. 4). This similarity in structure suggests that the biosynthesis of all enediyne warheads may proceed via similar polyunsaturated Fig. 3. The disruption of the gene encoding the calicheami-cin warhead PKS (calE8) in the calicheamicin-producing strain M. echinospora LL6000. (A) A 3.3-kb internal Bam HI frag-ment of calE8 (purple) was ligated into pOJ260 (24) to give plasmid pJAW117. This disruption construct was then transformed into LL6000 protoplasts by a slight modifica-tion of established methods. Proper integration of pJAW117, and calE8 disruption in LL6000, was confirmed by both PCR with primers adjacent to the cloned 3.3-kb fragment (25) and Southern hybridization with a 1.8 None kb internal calE8 DNA fragment to give the anticipated Pvu II\u2013Sph I and Sph I fragments shown (highlighted as dark grey bars). (B) For Southern hybridization, chromosomal DNA of mutants (pJAW117/LL6000-1 and pJAW117/ LL6000-3 as the two representative samples shown) and paternal LL6000 DNA was digested with Pvu II\u2013Sph I (lanes 1 to 3) and Sph I (lanes 4 to 9), respectively. Lanes 1 to 6 were hybridized with the 1.8 None kb internal fragment of calE8 (lanes 1 to 6). In a separate experiment, lanes 7 to 9 were hybridized with an 0.8-kb internal Sac I fragment of the apramycin resistance gene aprR. Hybridization with the calE8 probe revealed the integration of plasmid pJAW117 at the correct location in the genomes of all nine knockout mutants as represented by pJAW117/LL6000-1 and pJAW117/LL6000-3 (lanes 1 and 2 and 4 and 5, respectively) in compar-ison with the paternal genome (lanes 3 and 6), whereas hybridization with the aprR probe showed integration only in the mutants (lanes 7 and 8), but not in the paternal LL6000 genome (lane 9).

In this assay (20), calicheamicin provides both a zone of growth inhibition and the blue rings are indicative of DNA damage in the modified prophage indicator strain E. coli BR513. Zones 1 to 3 are controls in which zone 1 contained only 1 Nonel of CH3CN (the solvent used to deliver calicheamicin), whereas zones 2 and 3 contained 1 Nonel of different calicheamicin/CH3CN standards (100 ng and 10 ng, respectively). As revealed in zones 4 to 12, calicheamicin production was lacking in all nine pJAW117/LL6000 calE8 gene disruption mutants. As a separate control, a 1-Nonel sample of extracts from two representative isolates from the paternal LL6000 strains clearly revealed calicheamicin production (samples 13 and 14). These results were also confirmed by the MBL assay (21) and HPLC analysis of fermentation extracts. Fig. 4.

Sixma,2 Piet Gros1\u2020 Transient interactions of platelet-receptor glycoprotein IbNone (GpIbNone) and theplasma protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) reduce platelet velocity at sites of vascular damage and play a role in haemostasis and thrombosis. Here we present structures of the GpIbNone amino-terminal domain and its complex with the VWF domain A1. In the complex, GpIbNone wraps around one side of A1, providing two contact areas bridged by an area of solvated charge interaction. The structures explain the effects of gain-of-function mutations related to bleeding disorders and provide a model for shear-induced activation. These detailed insights into the initial interactions in platelet adhesion are relevant to the development of antithrombotic drugs. Transient interactions of platelet-receptor glycoprotein IbNone (GpIbNone) and immobilized von Willebrand factor (VWF) mediate the rolling of platelets at sites of vascular dam-age. Rolling reduces platelet velocity and prolongs the contact time with reactive com-ponents of the cell matrix. This facilitates platelet activation and subsequent integrin-mediated firm attachment (1). Platelet GpIbNone and VWF coexist in the circulation but do not interact at a detectable level unless shear stress is applied or exogenous modulators like the snake venom botrocetin are added (2). Four types of congenital bleeding disor-ders have been defined that are caused by mutations in GpIbNone or VWF, either enhanc-ing or reducing complex formation. Shear-induced GpIbNone-VWF interaction in occluded atherosclerotic arteries or at the surface of ruptured atherosclerotic plaques contributes critically to the onset of arterial thrombosis (3). GpIbNone is the central component of a re-ceptor complex consisting of glycoproteins IbNone and Ib\t, IX, and V. It anchors the com-plex to the cytoskeleton and harbors the VWF-binding function in its None290 NH2-ter-minal residues. The VWF-binding site is ex-posed well above the platelet surface, being connected to a None45-nm-long highly O-glyco-sylated stalk (4). The None250-kD VWF protein forms large disulfide-bonded multimers with molecular sizes of up to 10 MD. It is found in plasma and the subendothelial cell matrix and is released from storage granules when plate-lets and endothelial cells are activated. A VWF multimer acts as the bridging ligand between platelets and the cell matrix through collagen binding by its A3 domain and through GpIbNone binding by its A1 domain (5). Although the crystal structure of VWF-A1 is known (6, 7) and there is a large body of mutagenesis data (8\u201315), the precise interac-tions between GpIbNone and A1, the mechanism of shear-induced activation, and the molecu-lar basis of related bleeding disorders are poorly understood. We present crystal struc-tures of the NH2-terminal domain of GpIbNone (residues 1 to 290) and its complex with the VWF-A1 domain (residues 498 to 705; VWF residue numbering used here starts at the first residue of the mature subunit, and the addi-tion of 763 converts the numbering to that of preproVWF) (Table 1). We expressed recom-binant GpIbNone with the mutations N21Q and N159Q to remove N-glycosylation sites (16). Crystallization of the complex required the use of gain-of-function mutants GpIbNone-M239V and A1-R543Q, which are associated with platelet-type and type 2B von Wille-brand diseases and cause an enhanced affinity for complex formation [dissociation constant (Kd) None 5.8 nM (16)]. The crystal structure of the VWF-binding domain of GpIbNone displays an elongated, curved shape (Fig. 1A) that is typical for proteins con-taining leucine-rich repeats (17). Eight short leucine-rich repeats, seven of which were pre-dicted on the basis of the amino acid sequence, make up the central region of the molecule.

The colocaliza-tion of SgcD and SgcD1 along with the other C-1027 production genes assures the availabil-ity of anthranilate for secondary metabolite bio-synthesis. Although it remains unclear what the origin of the C3 unit is and how it is fused to the anthranilate intermediate to form the morpholi-none moiety of 7, the latter is apparently acti-vated as an acyl-S-CoA for attachment to 4 by SgcD6 (Fig. 2B). To support this hypothesis, we inactivated sgcD6 (see SOM). The resultant S. globisporus SB1004 mutant strain complete-ly lost its ability to produce 1 (Fig. 3F). The fact that the biosynthetic building blocks are acti-vated as aminoacy-S-PCP, acyl-S-CoA, and nu-cleotide diphosphosugar; and are attached to the enediyne core by an NRPS condensation en-zyme, an acyltransferase, and a glycosyl trans-ferase, respectively, highlights nature\u2019s effi-ciency and versatility in synthesizing complex molecules.",
        "Finally, we inactivated the sgcC hydroxy-lase gene to demonstrate the production of enediyne metabolites by manipulating genes governing C-1027 biosynthesis (see SOM). The resulting S. globisporus SB1006 mutant strain still produces a chromoprotein complex that is biologically active, as judged by bioassay against M. luteus, but is distinct from 1 upon HPLC analysis (Fig. 3G). The resulting enediyne chromophores were isolated (see SOM) and subjected to ESI-MS analysis. 2 exhibited an (M None H)None ion at m/z None 828, consistent with the molecular formula C43H42N3O12Cl, and 8 showed an (M None H) None ion at m/z None 830, consistent with the molecular formula C43H44N3O12Cl. By comparison with 1 and 3, 2 and 8 were deduced to be deshy-droxy-C-1027 (2) and its aromatized product (8) (Fig. 1), as would be predicted according to Fig. 2D. Intriguingly, 2 is at least fivefold more stable than is 1 at 25\u00b0C, in respect to undergo-ing the Bergman cyclization (see SOM), a prop-erty that could be potentially explored in devel-oping C-1027 into a clinically useful drug. We envisage applying methods of combinatorial biosynthesis to the enediyne system for the production of polyketides.",

        "The enediynes exemplify nature\u2019s ingenuity. We have cloned and characterized the biosynthetic locus coding for perhaps the most notorious member of the nonchromoprotein enediyne family, calicheamicin. This gene cluster contains an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) that is demonstrated to be essential for enediyne biosynthesis. Comparison of the calicheamicin locus with the locus encoding the chromoprotein enediyne C-1027 reveals that the enediyne PKS is highly conserved among these distinct enediyne families. Contrary to previous hypotheses, this suggests that the chromoprotein and nonchromoprotein enediynes are generated by similar biosynthetic pathways.",
        "Calicheamicin None1 I (Fig. 1) from Mi-cromonospora echinospora ssp. calichensis is the most prominent member of the non-chromoprotein enediyne family and, as an antitumor agent, is None 5000 times as potent as adriamycin (1). Calicheamicin has two distinct structural regions: The aryltetrasac-charide is composed of a set of carbohy-drate and aromatic units, which delivers the metabolite specifically into the minor groove of DNA (2); the aglycone, or \u201cwar-head,\u201d consists of a highly functionalized bicyclo[7.3.1]tridecadiynene core structure",
        "with an allylic trisulfide serving as the initial trigger for warhead cycloaromatiza-tion (3). Once the aryltetrasaccharide is docked to DNA, aromatization of the bicyclo[7.3.1]tridecadiynene core struc-ture, by means of a 1,4-dehydrobenzene-diradical, results in the site-specific oxida-tive double-strand scission of the targeted DNA (4 ). In vitro and in vivo studies con-firm the role of calicheamicin as a DNA-damaging agent and even suggest that cali-cheamicin may favor cleavage at certain chromosomal sites (5). Although this ex-traordinary reactivity has sparked consider-able interest in the pharmaceutical industry, calicheamicin lacks tumor specificity. To circumvent this problem, conjugation of calicheamicin to tumor-specific monoclo-nal antibodies has been used as a targeting strategy.

        "Although innovative synthetic schemes have been devised for calicheamicin (7), surprisingly little is known about how the warhead is synthesized in nature. Our under-standing of calicheamicin biosynthesis is lim-ited to a set of metabolic labeling experi-ments performed on the related enediyne esperamicin (Fig. S1, compound 5) (8). We report the elucidation of the calicheamicin gene locus from Micromonospora echinos-pora ssp. calichensis, which reveals an un-usual iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) gene (calE8). Disruption of this PKS gene in the calicheamicin-producer Micromonospora provides a strain no longer capable of pro-ducing calicheamicin and suggests that this PKS is critical for enediyne formation. A homolog of this PKS has also been found in the C-1027 gene cluster encoding a member of the structurally distinct chromoprotein enediynes [see companion paper (9)]. In con-trast to previous biosynthetic hypotheses (10), this finding suggests that all enediynes may share a common biosynthetic origin. This work also lays the foundation for future metabolic engineering strategies to generate enediyne analogs.",
        "Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013based screening and screens for clones capable of conferring calicheamicin resistance (11), nine overlapping cosmid clones were isolated from a genomic library of M. echinospora ssp. calichensis (NRRL 15839). Although sequence analysis of these clones was consistent with genes encoding aryltetrasaccha-ride biosynthesis and calicheamicin resistance, initial attempts to complete the biosynthetic locus by chromosomal walking were unsuc-cessful (12). To circumvent this problem, we used a shotgun-based approach to finish the calicheamicin locus. DNA sequence analysis revealed 74 open reading frames (ORFs) that span more than 90 kb (Fig. 2). They include 16 genes expected to participate in polyketide con-struction or modification (O1 to O6 and E1 to E10), nine putative regulatory elements (R1 to R9), seven genes associated with membrane transport (T1 to T7), 14 genes consistent with the expected production of four unusual acti-vated nucleotide sugars (S1 to S14), four gly-cosyltransferase genes (G1 to G4), an insertion-al element (IS), and 22 ORFs (U1 to U22) of unknown function (13). The known resistance gene calC (11) was also found to reside near the middle of this locus. Given the long-standing controversy sur-",
        "rounding the biosynthetic origin of the enediyne moiety, the polyketide-associated genes within the calicheamicin gene cluster are most relevant to our hypothesis. The two distinct calicheamicin structural elements\u2014 the calicheamicin warhead (Fig. 1, PKS E) and the orsellinic acid derivative found with-in the aryltetrasaccharide (Fig. 1, PKS O)\u2014 are each expected to derive from a separate polyketide precursor. Consistent with this, the calicheamicin locus (Fig. 2, genes calE8 and calO5) encodes two separate iterative type I PKSs (CalE8 and CalO5). CalO5 shows striking similarity (65% identity, 93% similarity) to the PKS (AviM) responsible for orsellinic acid biosynthesis in S. viridochro-mogenes en route to the biosynthesis of the orthosomycin antibiotic avilamycin A (14). Thus, CalO5 likely plays an identical role in the biosynthesis of the calicheamicin aryltet-rasaccharide. In contrast, CalE8 demonstrates the greatest sequence homology to two iter-ative PKSs involved in the biosynthesis of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosa-pentaenoic acid (EPA) in Shewanella (15, 17) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in Moritella marina (16, 17).",
        "To confirm that CalE8 is critical to the biosynthesis of calicheamicin in Micromonos-pora, a calE8 gene disruption was constructed by introduction of an apramycin selectable marker (Fig. 3A). The calicheamicin producer M. echinospora is resistant to most antibiotics, and is inherently indisposed to genetic manip-ulation, with a best reported transformation ef-ficiency of 10None7 transformants per microgram DNA (18). In spite of these difficulties, a com-bination of many gene disruption attempts in M. echinospora LL6000 (19) led to nine indepen-dent apramycin-resistant clones. All nine iso-lates mapped consistently with the expected calE8 gene disruption by both PCR fragment amplification and Southern hybridization. The representative hybridization results from two of these clones (pJAW117/LL6000-1 and pJAW117/LL6000-3) are illustrated in Fig. 3B.

With one exception (N1999A), the 9-membered enediynes are chromoprotein enediynes, whereas all 10-membered enediynes to date are nonchromoprotein.

        "Paternal LL6000 isolates produced 0.5 to 0.8 mg/liter calicheamicin, as expected. In con-trast, the mutant strains with the calE8 gene disrupted were both devoid of any cali-cheamicin, known calicheamicin derivatives, and/or enediyne activity by all three methods of detection (Fig. 3C). Because disruption of PKS O machinery is anticipated to provide a structure lacking PKS O and the terminal rhamnose (similar to that of namenamicin, Fig. S1, compound 6) (22), the result of our calE8 disruption is consistent with elimina-tion of the PKS machinery involved in war-head construction (PKS E) and supports our assignment of CalE8 as this essential entity.",
        "Full-length CalE8 is 1919 amino acids in length (Fig. 2). Comparing CalE8 with the known domains of both type I PKS protypes (23) and the PUFA PKSs (which include domains for ketosynthase, KS; acyltrans-ferase, AT; acyl carrier protein, ACP; ketore-ductase, KR; and dehydratase, DH), we find domains as follows: A CalE8 KS domain spans positions 3 to 467; an AT domain spans positions 482 to 905; a KR domain spans positions 1153 to 1414 and a DH domain spans positions 1422 to 1563. Given the sim-ilarity in organization between CalE8 and the PUFA PKSs, the region bridging the AT and KR domains might harbor a putative ACP domain. Yet, in comparison with either the PUFA PKSs or other iterative type I PKSs, there are few obvious ACP markers within this CalE8 domain 1, and thus, this assign-ment is speculative. The COOH-terminal do-main of CalE8 (positions 1582 to 1919, des-ignated TD) also lacks homology to any known PKS or protein.",
        "Interestingly, CalE8 shows remarkable sim-ilarity (56% identity and 67% similarity, over-all) in both sequence and organization to an enediyne PKS (SgcE) from the C-1027 biosyn-thetic gene locus (9). C-1027 (Fig. S1, com-pound 4) is a member of structurally distinct chromoprotein enediyne family, previously postulated to derive from a fatty acid precursor (10). In both CalE8 and SgcE, all six domains are evident and four of these six (KS, AT, KR, and DH) are highly conserved. Significant ho-mology divergence is observed in the region bridging the AT and KR domains, a phenome-non common to type I PKSs (23), and the COOH-terminal region (TD) (Fig. 4) (9). In contrast to previous hypotheses, the observed CalE8/SgcE relationship clearly implicates a common PKS progenitor for both the chro-moprotein (C-1027) and nonchromoprotein (calicheamicin) enediynes. In further support of this hypothesis, inspection of representative chromoprotein (C-1027) and nonchromopro-tein (dynemicin and calicheamicin) warheads reveals a common cyclododecylpolyene skele-ton (Fig. 4). This similarity in structure suggests that the biosynthesis of all enediyne warheads may proceed via similar polyunsaturated",

In a separate experiment, lanes 7 to 9 were hybridized with an 0.8-kb internal Sac I fragment of the apramycin resistance gene aprR. Hybridization with the calE8 probe revealed the integration of plasmid pJAW117 at the correct location in the genomes of all nine knockout mutants as represented by pJAW117/LL6000-1 and pJAW117/LL6000-3 (lanes 1 and 2 and 4 and 5, respectively) in compar-ison with the paternal genome (lanes 3 and 6), whereas hybridization with the aprR probe showed integration only in the mutants (lanes 7 and 8), but not in the paternal LL6000 genome (lane 9).

Zones 1 to 3 are controls in which zone 1 contained only 1 Nonel of CH3CN (the solvent used to deliver calicheamicin), whereas zones 2 and 3 contained 1 Nonel of different calicheamicin/CH3CN standards (100 ng and 10 ng, respectively). As revealed in zones 4 to 12, calicheamicin production was lacking in all nine pJAW117/LL6000 calE8 gene disruption mutants. As a separate control, a 1-Nonel sample of extracts from two representative isolates from the paternal LL6000 strains clearly revealed calicheamicin production (samples 13 and 14).

        "Transient interactions of platelet-receptor glycoprotein IbNone (GpIbNone) and theplasma protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) reduce platelet velocity at sites of vascular damage and play a role in haemostasis and thrombosis. Here we present structures of the GpIbNone amino-terminal domain and its complex with the VWF domain A1. In the complex, GpIbNone wraps around one side of A1, providing two contact areas bridged by an area of solvated charge interaction. The structures explain the effects of gain-of-function mutations related to bleeding disorders and provide a model for shear-induced activation. These detailed insights into the initial interactions in platelet adhesion are relevant to the development of antithrombotic drugs.",
        "Transient interactions of platelet-receptor glycoprotein IbNone (GpIbNone) and immobilized von Willebrand factor (VWF) mediate the rolling of platelets at sites of vascular dam-age. Rolling reduces platelet velocity and prolongs the contact time with reactive com-ponents of the cell matrix. This facilitates platelet activation and subsequent integrin-mediated firm attachment (1). Platelet GpIbNone and VWF coexist in the circulation but do not",
        "interact at a detectable level unless shear stress is applied or exogenous modulators like the snake venom botrocetin are added (2). Four types of congenital bleeding disor-ders have been defined that are caused by mutations in GpIbNone or VWF, either enhanc-ing or reducing complex formation. Shear-induced GpIbNone-VWF interaction in occluded atherosclerotic arteries or at the surface of ruptured atherosclerotic plaques contributes critically to the onset of arterial thrombosis (3). GpIbNone is the central component of a re-ceptor complex consisting of glycoproteins IbNone and Ib\t, IX, and V. It anchors the com-plex to the cytoskeleton and harbors the VWF-binding function in its None290 NH2-ter-minal residues. The VWF-binding site is ex-posed well above the platelet surface, being connected to a None45-nm-long highly O-glyco-sylated stalk (4). The None250-kD VWF protein",
        "forms large disulfide-bonded multimers with molecular sizes of up to 10 MD. It is found in plasma and the subendothelial cell matrix and is released from storage granules when plate-lets and endothelial cells are activated. A VWF multimer acts as the bridging ligand between platelets and the cell matrix through collagen binding by its A3 domain and through GpIbNone binding by its A1 domain (5).",
        "Although the crystal structure of VWF-A1 is known (6, 7) and there is a large body of mutagenesis data (8\u201315), the precise interac-tions between GpIbNone and A1, the mechanism of shear-induced activation, and the molecu-lar basis of related bleeding disorders are poorly understood. We present crystal struc-tures of the NH2-terminal domain of GpIbNone (residues 1 to 290) and its complex with the VWF-A1 domain (residues 498 to 705; VWF residue numbering used here starts at the first residue of the mature subunit, and the addi-tion of 763 converts the numbering to that of preproVWF) (Table 1). We expressed recom-binant GpIbNone with the mutations N21Q and N159Q to remove N-glycosylation sites (16). Crystallization of the complex required the use of gain-of-function mutants GpIbNone-M239V and A1-R543Q, which are associated with platelet-type and type 2B von Wille-brand diseases and cause an enhanced affinity for complex formation [dissociation constant (Kd) None 5.8 nM (16)].",
        "The crystal structure of the VWF-binding domain of GpIbNone displays an elongated, curved shape (Fig. 1A) that is typical for proteins con-taining leucine-rich repeats (17). Eight short leucine-rich repeats, seven of which were pre-dicted on the basis of the amino acid sequence, make up the central region of the molecule. Flanking sequences, which are conserved among numerous extracellular proteins includ-ing the other members of the GpIb-IX-V com-",
