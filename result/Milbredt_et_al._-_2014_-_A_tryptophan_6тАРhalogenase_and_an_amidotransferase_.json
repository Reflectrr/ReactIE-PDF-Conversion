Patallo, and Karl-Heinz van PNonee*[a] Introduction A variety of natural compounds that show plant growth-regu-lating activities have been isolated from living organisms. Most, such as helminthosporol,[1] sclerin,[2] and spicifernin[3] are secondary metabolites isolated from fungi. During screening for new plant growth-regulating substances in microorgan-isms, such as actinomycetes, a secondary metabolite of Strep-tomyces albogriseolus MJ286-76F7 was isolated (thienodolin, 1; Scheme 1).[4] The structure of this compound was elucidated in the early 1990s by Kanbe et al. as 6-chloro-8H-thieno[2,3-b]-indole-2-carboxamide (molecular formula C11H7N2OClS, M = 250.71 g molNone1) by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analyses.[5] Thienodolin has a unique secondary metabolite structure: a thienoindole skeleton chlorinated at the 6-position of the indole ring. The total chemical synthesis of thienodolin was accomplished in three steps starting from 6-chlorooxin-dole.[6] The alkaloid thienodolin was the first actinomycete metabo-lite to show concentration-dependent growth-regulating activi-ties in rice seedlings. Growth promotion occurred over the range 1.2\u201312 mm, whereas growth inhibition was evident above 40 mm.[4] It is not known whether the thienoindole skele-ton of thienodolin is essential for its plant growth-regulating activity. A certain structural resemblance of the indole moiety to the auxin indole-3-acetic acid is obvious, but auxin activity could not be determined for thienodolin.[4] Recently, it was shown that thienodolin suppresses nitric oxide synthase and might thus be of pharmaceutical interest.[7] There is currently no information about the biosynthetic pathway of thienodolin. However, because of its structural similarity to tryptophan, it has been proposed that this amino acid could be its precursor, and that (as for other known halogenated secondary metabo-lites derived from tryptophan, like pyrrolnitrin,[8] pyrroindomy-cin,[9] and rebeccamycin)[10] the first biosynthetic step in thieno-dolin biosynthesis might be halogenation of the indole ring of tryptophan catalyzed by a tryptophan 6-halogenase. The iden-tification of a gene coding for a FADH2-dependent tryptophan 6-halogenase[11] in the genome of the thienodolin producer S. albogriseolus supported this hypothesis, but there was no experimental evidence for participation by this enzyme in thie-nodolin biosynthesis. Here, we investigated the involvement of this tryptophan 6-halogenase in the biosynthesis of thienodolin; we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster, elucidated the last biosynthetic step of thienodolin biosynthesis, and suggest a biosynthetic pathway for thienodolin. Results Production of thienodolin and 6-bromothienodolin (6-bromothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxamide) by S. albogriseolus Thienodolin was successfully extracted from the culture broth and the mycelium of S. albogriseolus grown in the medium de-scribed by Kanbe et al.[4] Identification of thienodolin was ach-ieved from its characteristic UV absorbance spectrum (lmax = 329.1 nm, 288.6 nm, 271.2 nm (shoulder), 235.7 nm, and by HPLC/MS analysis, which gave a mass (m/z 248.7/250.6 [MNoneH]None ; Figure 1 B) that corresponded to the molecular mass of thienodolin (calculated mass M = 250.00/251.99 g molNone1) as well as the expected fragmentation pattern. When grown in the presence of bromide, 6-bromothienodo-lin was detected in small amounts in ethyl acetate extracts of S. albogriseolus. HPLC/MS analysis gave m/z 292.9/294.9 The biosynthetic gene cluster for the plant growth-regulating compound thienodolin was identified in and cloned from the producer organism Streptomyces albogriseolus MJ286-76F7. Se-quence analysis of a 27 kb DNA region revealed the presence of 21 ORFs, 14 of which are involved in thienodolin biosynthe-sis. Three insertional inactivation mutants were generated in the sequenced region to analyze their involvement in thieno-dolin biosynthesis and to functionally characterize specific genes. The gene inactivation experiments together with enzyme assays with enzymes obtained by heterologous ex-pression and feeding studies showed that the first step in thie-nodolin biosynthesis is catalyzed by a tryptophan 6-halogenase and that the last step is the formation of a carboxylic amide group catalyzed by an amidotransferase. The results led to a hypothetical model for thienodolin biosynthesis. [a] Dr. D. Milbredt, Dr. E. P.

Cloning and organization of the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster To elucidate the pathway for thienodolin biosynthe-sis, a cosmid library (3500 clones) of S. albogriseolus MJ286-76F7 was constructed. Based on the hypothe-sis that thdH, the gene that encodes tryptophan 6-halogenase ThdH (formerly, Thal),[11] is part of the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster, the cosmid li-brary was screened with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled thdH gene. Three overlapping cosmids (cos2B8, cos3A8, and cos3G10; Figure 3) were identified. The sequenced genomic region represented by the partially sequenced cosmid cos2B8 encompasses 26.7 kb and contains according to BLAST!! analysis (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/), one incomplete and 21 complete open reading frames (ORFs, Figure 3). All show high G + C content and a G + C bias at the third codon position (characteristic of Streptomyces genes). General knowledge of the organization of secondary metabolite gene clusters and the structur-al features of thienodolin suggested that 14 of the identified ORFs are involved in the biosynthesis of this alkaloid. Among them, nine probable structural genes were identified, as well as five genes possibly involved in regulation and transport. BLAST bioinfor-matics analysis of predicted gene products with the proposed functions is presented in Table 1. The suggested borders of the cluster are the two-component regulatory system thdK/thdL (left) and the transcriptional regulator thdR (right; K, L, and R in Scheme 1. Proposed biosynthetic pathway of thienodolin. The first step, halogenation of tryptophan catalyzed by the tryptophan-6-halogenase ThdH, and Figure 3). The gene products of thdK and thdL show high simi-larity to the histidine kinase AbsA1 and its cognate response regulator AbsA2, respectively, from Streptomyces lividans TK24. The gene thdR is transcribed in the opposite direction to that of the other putative genes of the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster and shows significant homology to LysR-type transcriptional regulators. The other genes of the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster are located between these two types of regulatory systems. The translation product of one gene, thdA, might be in-volved in thienodolin transport or a resistance mechanism. ThdA resembles ion exchangers found in many secondary me-tabolite gene clusters and might therefore be responsible for efflux of thienodolin and/or the transport of protons into the cell. thdH encodes tryptophan 6-halogenase, which has been sug-gested to catalyze the regio-selective chlorination of trypto-phan to 6-chlorotryptophan during thienodolin biosynthe-sis.[11] This flavin-dependent halo-genase requires the participation of a flavin reductase, which seems to be encoded by thdF ; ThdF shows high similarity to flavin reductases from a number of known biosynthetic gene clusters for halogenated secon-dary metabolites. ThdD shows high similarity to amidotransfer-ases, thus suggesting that it might be responsible for the for-mation of the carboxylic amide group. ThdN (384 amino acids) contains a PLP-binding domain and shows significant homology to aminotransferases from vari-ous organisms. The products of several genes have no obvious function in thienodolin biosyn-thesis. ThdM and ThdY are puta-tive proteins with only poor ho-mology to several other putative proteins. Based on sequence analysis alone, it was not possi-ble to suggest roles for ThdM and ThdY in the biosynthesis of thienodolin. For ThdM, a role in sulfur incorporation was sug-gested, as it showed some ho-mology to a hypothetical protein from Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (formerly annotated as a putative 2-methyl-thioadenine synthetase). Four putative gene products showed significant ho-mology to known proteins, but without a clear function in thienodolin biosynthesis. Genes thdB, thdC, thdE, and thdO were predicted to encode a DNA-binding protein, a cytochrome P450 protein, a short-chain de-hydrogenase/reductase, and a FAD-dependent oxidase, respec-tively. ORFs 1\u20135 and 6\u20138 (left and right flanks of the gene cluster) do not seem to have any role in thienodolin biosynthesis. ORFs 1\u20135 code for three different types of transcriptional regu-lators (ORF1, -3, and -4), an alcohol dehydrogenase (ORF2), and a hypothetical protein of unknown function (ORF5); ORFs 6\u20138 code for proteins involved in sugar metabolism. Figure 2. Analysis of ethyl acetate extracts of S. albogriseolus DthdH grown in the presence of different halogenat-Construction of S. albogriseolus gene inactivation mutants DthdH, DthdD, and DthdN, and analysis of an intermediate of thienodolin biosynthesis Tryptophan 6-halogenase is encoded by thdH ; thdD and thdN putatively encode an amidotransferase and an aminotransfer-ase, respectively. These genes were inactivated by deleting parts of the genes and inserting the apramycin resistance cas-sette acc(3)IV into the gene to be inactivated (see Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Organic extracts of five-day-old cultures of wild-type S. albogriseolus and DthdH, DthdD, and DthdN mutants were prepared and analyzed by HPLC. Thienodolin was produced by wild-type S. albogriseolus (tR = 68 min), but no thienodolin was detected in ethyl acetate extracts from the mutant strains. HPLC-analysis of organic ex-tracts of S. albogriseolus DthdD indicated the presence of three compounds that were absent from wild-type S. albogriseolus : metD1, metD2, and metD3, with retention times (tR) of 45, 78, and 82 min, respectively (Figure 1 A). The major compound, metD1 (tR = 45 min), showed an UV absorbance spectrum very similar to that of thienodolin (Figure 1) with lmax(metD1) = 318.4, 287.8, 266.3, and 237.4 nm (Figure 1 C). The UV spectra of the minor compounds, metD2 and metD3, did not show any similarity to those of thienodolin or tryptophan (data not shown). Thus, metD2 and metD3 were not analyzed in detail. MetD1 was purified by preparative HPLC and further analyzed by HPLC/MS and 1H NMR. HPLC/MS analysis of metD1 (m/z 249.6/251.7 [MNoneH]None) indicated that the molecule contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms and furthermore showed an isotope distribution typical of a monochlorinated compound (Figure 1 C). 1H NMR analysis ([D6]DMSO, 500.13 MHz) gave four signals for aromatic protons: dH = 7.92 ppm (s, 1 H, ArH) ; 7.78 ppm (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 1 H, ArH), 7.48 ppm (d, J = 1.8 Hz, 1 H, ArH), 7.16 ppm (dd, J = 8.4, 1.8 Hz, 1 H, ArH). Comparison of these data with 1H NMR signals obtained for thienodolin[4] to-gether with the similar UV absorption spectra of the two com-pounds (Figure 1 B and C) led to the conclusion that thienodo-lin and metD1 have high structural similarity and that metD1 very likely has a thienoindole skeleton. Given that ThdD might catalyze an amidotransferase reaction, compound metD1 was proposed to be 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid (2 ; Scheme 1) with a molecular mass of M = 250.98/ 252.98 g molNone1 (calculated mass M = 250.98 g molNone1). To test this hypothesis, 2 was synthesized in five steps start-ing from 6-chlorooxindole. The final product was characterized by HPLC/MS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures S1 and S2) and by its UV absorption spectrum (HPLC/MS: m/z 249.6/251.7 [MNoneH]None ; 1H NMR (500.13 MHz, [D6]DMSO): dH = 12.20 ppm (br. s, 1 H, NH), 7.79 ppm (s, 1 H, ArH), 7.70 ppm (d, Table 1. Genes identified in and near the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster and putative functions. J = 8.4 Hz, 1 H, ArH), 7.52 ppm (s, 1 H, ArH), 7.04 ppm (dd, J = 8.4, 1.8, 1 H, ArH) ; 13C NMR (125.75 MHz, [D6]DMSO): dC = 167.5 ppm (s, -COOH), 144.2 ppm (s, >C =), 142.0 ppm (s, > C =), 137.8 ppm (s, multiplicity, >C =), 126.2 ppm (s, >C =), 122.9 ppm (s, >C =), 120.8 ppm (s, >C =), 119.9 ppm (d, -C =), 119.6 ppm (d, -C =), 119.0 ppm (d. -C =), 111.3 ppm (s -C =) ; UV (MeOH), lmax = 317.9 nm, 287.6 nm, 266.0 nm, and 236.8 nm. The data obtained for synthesized 2 correspond to those ob-tained for metD1. When the chemically synthesized compound was co-injected with metD1 and analyzed by HPLC, only a single peak appeared. Thus, metD1 was verified as 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid (2). Conversion of compound 2 to thienodolin in vivo and in vitro Chemically synthesized 2 was used for in vivo and in vitro anal-ysis of the amidotransferase activity of ThdD. For this purpose, thdD was ligated into the Escherichia coli\u2013Pseudomonas shuttle vector pCIB0 and and transferred into Pseudomonas fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 to create strain DORF1\u20134 pCIB0thdD. Transla-tion was achieved by attaching the ribosome binding site from prnA of P. fluorescens BL915, and expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4 A). Feeding of P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0thdD with 2 revealed that this compound was converted to thienodolin by ThdD. Thienodolin was isolated both from P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0thdD cells and from the medium after cultiva-tion in the presence of 2. No thienodolin was obtained from the control strain, P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0 (Fig-ure 4 B). In vitro analysis of amidotransferase activity of ThdD was performed with cell-free crude extract of P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0thdD obtained by sonication. Thienodolin was detected by HPLC analysis when using glutamine as an amino group donor (Figure 4 C). Almost identical results were ob-tained when ammonium acetate was used as the amino group donor (results not shown). Thus, ThdD was identified as the enzyme that catalyzes the last step in thienodolin biosynthesis: formation of the carboxylic amide group. Chemical complementation of S. albogriseolus DthdH with 6-chlorotryptophan and other halogenated tryptophans Upon feeding of the S. albogriseolus DthdH mutant with chemi-cally synthesized 6-chlorotryptophan, thienodolin production was restored. When this strain was cultured in the presence of 6-bromotryptophan, 6-bromothienodolin was obtained (Figure 2). The biosynthetic products were detected by HPLC analysis in ethyl acetate extracts of five-day-old cultures after cultivation for 4 days in the presence of the respective sub-strate, and these were identified by their characteristic UV absorbance spectra and HPLC/MS analysis. The latter gave masses of m/z 248.7/250.6 [MNoneH]None for thienodolin and m/z 292.9/294.9 [MNoneH]None for 6-bro-mothienodolin, and showed iso-tope distributions typical for chlorine and bromine, respec-tively (Figures 1 B and 2 B). Feed-ing of S. albogriseolus DthdH with 5-chlorotryptophan and 7-chlorotryptophan did not result in the production of the 5-and 7-chloro-substituted analogues of thienodolin (Figure 2 A). Discussion In many cases, the bromo ana-logues of chlorinated metabo-lites produced by soil bacteria can be obtained when chloride in the culture broth is substitut-ed with bromide.[12] This is also the case for the biosynthesis of thienodolin, and is in accordance with previous results obtained with purified tryptophan 6-halo-genase ThdH, which was shown to catalyze the regioselective chlorination, as well as bromina-tion, of tryptophan in the 6-posi-tion.[11] Feeding of the deletion mutant S. albogriseolus DthdH Figure 4. In vivo and in vitro conversion of 2 into thienodolin by the amidotransferase ThdD. A) SDS-PAGE of the with 6-chlorotryptophan and 6-bromotryptophan led to the production of thienodolin and 6-bromothienodolin, respective-ly, thus indicating that substitution of chlorine with bromine does not have any influence on the enzymes along the biosyn-thetic pathway, as has been observed for other biosynthetic pathways.[13, 14] In contrast, halogenation of tryptophan at the 6-position of the indole ring seems to be a prerequisite for thienodolin biosynthesis, as neither unhalogenated thienodolin derivatives nor 5-or 7-chloro-substituted thienodolin ana-logues were detected in the DthdH mutant after feeding with the respective chlorotryptophans. ThdH is a flavin-dependent halogenase; it requires a flavin reductase for the formation of the reduced FAD required by the halogenase. A putative flavin reductase gene, thdF, was found in the cluster. However, it has been shown that ThdH, like other flavin-dependent halogenases, accepts free FADH2, and there seems to be no specific association between these two components of the halogenase system.[15, 16] Thus, in vivo, other flavin reductases, which are always present in organisms, can provide reduced flavin for the halogenase.[17] This is consis-tent with the fact that a number of halometabolite biosynthe-sis gene clusters have been identified without a flavin reduc-tase gene.[18, 19] Therefore, it is possible that ThdF is part of a two-component monooxygenase system. The oxygenase part of such a system could be ThdC (an enzyme with homology to cytochrome P450 enzymes) or ThdO (homologous to FAD-dependent oxidoreductases). Further downstream in the biosynthetic pathway, activation of the a-carbon of 6-chlorotryptophan is necessary. For this activation and the subsequent sulfur incorporation, different reactions can be imagined. Activation of the a-carbon of 6-chlorotryptophan could be achieved by oxidative deamination to 6-chloroindole-3-pyruvate, catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme.[20] A gene coding for such a protein was found in the biosynthetic gene cluster of thienodolin. The protein ThdC shows homology to several cytochrome P450 monooxygenas-es from other Gram-positive bacteria and might catalyze this oxidative deamination. A second route for 6-chloroindole-3-pyruvate formation is an oxidation reaction analogous to the reaction catalyzed by the amino acid oxidases StaO (stauro-sporine biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064)[21] and RebO (rebeccamycin biosynthesis in Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes).[10] These enzymes catalyze the formation of indole-3-pyruvate from tryptophan and 7-chloroindole-3-pyru-vate from 7-chlorotryptophan, respectively, in monooxygenase reactions that release ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. A similar reaction, generating 6-chloroindole-3-pyruvate from 6-chlorotryptophan, seems unlikely for thienodolin biosynthesis, as no gene coding for a protein similar to RebO or StaO was detected in the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster. The most probable route for a-C activation is an aminotrans-ferase reaction. The enzyme might be encoded by thdN. ThdN shows significant homology to aminotransferases and contains a pyridoxal-5\u2019-phosphate binding motif. In an aminotransferase reaction, the a-amino group of the substrate is transferred to the a-carbon of an a-keto acid (a-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, or pyruvate), thus forming a new a-keto acid from the sub-strate and an amino acid (glutamate or aspartate). In the con-text of the biosynthesis of thienodolin, the putative amino-transferase ThdN would convert 6-chlorotryptophan to 6-chlor-oindole-3-pyruvate, which could then be the substrate for sulfur insertion at the activated a-carbon atom by nucleophilic attack of a sulfur donor, such as a thiocarboxylic acid, a persul-fide or a hydrogen sulfide anion[22, 23] catalyzed by another enzyme. After sulfur incorporation leading to 6-chloroindole-3-thiopyruvate, ring-closure to form the thienoindole skeleton would be necessary; however, no gene coding for an enzyme with putative cyclase activity was found in the thienodolin bio-synthetic gene cluster. Candidates for sulfur insertion and ring closure are ThdM and ThdY (homologous to putative proteins, but with no indication for their function). The subsequent oxi-dation of the new ring might be catalyzed by the potential FAD-dependent oxidase ThdO. The last step in thienodolin biosynthesis is catalyzed by the 605-residue enzyme ThdD. This shows high homology to vari-ous proteins of the amidotransferase family, which is a special form of the asparagine synthetase family. Asparagine synthe-tase family proteins are found in primary metabolism (mainly in asparagine biosynthesis), but some of them, especially the amidotransferases, also appear in secondary metabolism. A well described example of an amidotransferase in secondary metabolism is the Streptomyces rimosus enzyme OxyD involved in the formation of the malonamate starter unit during oxy-tetracycline biosynthesis.[24] This shows high homology (74 % similarity, 60 % identity) to ThdD. Analysis of the primary struc-ture of ThdD for conserved motifs revealed affiliation to type II asparagine synthetases. ThdD shows the two-domain architec-ture typical for enzymes of this family: an N-terminal glutami-nase domain and a C-terminal synthase domain.[25] Similarly to guanosinemonophosphate synthetase (EC 6.3.5.2)[26] and glu-cosamine 6-phosphate synthetase (EC 2.6.1.16),[27] the two do-mains of ThdD are on a single polypeptide. An example of an amidotransferase with the two domains on separate subunits is carbamoylphosphate synthetase (EC 6.3.5.5).[28] The glutami-nase domain contains a nucleophilic cysteine residue C2, which is highly conserved in all proteins of this family and is essential for the glutamine-hydrolyzing activity of the en-zymes.[29] In this part of the enzyme, glutamine is converted to glutamate and ammonia, which is then transported to the syn-thetase domain where it is used to aminate the substrate in an ATP-dependent reaction. Corresponding to the mechanism common among asparagine synthetases, the substrate is prob-ably activated as a substrate\u2013AMP intermediate.[30] An assay developed to characterize E. coli asparagine synthetase B[31] could be applied to verify in vitro ThdD-catalyzed conversion of 2 to thienodolin. ThdD accepts glutamine as well as free ammonium ions (in the form of ammonium acetate) as the amino group donor. In both cases, thienodolin could be de-tected by HPLC-UV analysis (characteristic UV absorption spec-trum), thereby verifying that ThdD catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of thienodolin. Any downstream effects of the three mutations can be ruled out, as addition of 6-chlorotryptophan to the halogenase mutant led to the formation of thienodolin. Thus all the en-None 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim ChemBioChem 2014, 15, 1011 \u2013 1020 1016 CHEMBIOCHEM FULL PAPERS www.chembiochem.org zymes required for thienodolin biosynthesis after formation of 6-chlorotryptophan by the halogenase ThdH as the first step in thienodolin biosynthesis are functional. In the case of the ami-notransferase mutant, any downstream effects on other bio-synthetic genes can be ruled out because thdN is the last gene in the biosynthetic gene cluster. Any effect of the destruction of thdD can be ruled out as ThdD catalyzes the last step in thienodolin biosynthesis, and all the enzymes required for for-mation of the last intermediate were still functional in the ami-dotransferase mutant. In analogy to the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin, where the ion exchanger RebU was found to be involved in efflux of the secondary metabolite,[10] a role for ThdA in thienodolin efflux is now proposed. Furthermore, it can be hypothesized that ThdA is necessary to establish and maintain concentration gradients between the extracellular matrix and the cytosol. These gradi-ents and established membrane potentials are the basis for many cellular processes, especially Na+-or H+-dependent sec-ondary transport systems important for uptake or efflux of me-tabolites and other ions.[32] They are important for maintaining the intracellular pH, intracellular ion concentrations and the cell volume of actively metabolizing cells.[33] Besides RebU (re-beccamycin biosynthesis), transporters of this class can be found in the biosynthetic gene clusters of many halogenated secondary metabolites, such as PrnF, AviJ, ComF, and SimEx2 from the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin, avilamycin A, complesta-tin, and simocyclinone D8, respectively.[34\u201337] For regulation of thienodolin production, two different types of regulatory systems are proposed: the two-component system ThdK/ThdL (genes thdK and thdL at the left of the clus-ter) and the LysR-type transcriptional regulator ThdR (thdR at the right). Conclusions In this paper, we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster of thie-nodolin, the first growth-regulating compound identified in ac-tinomycetes. Parts of the pathway of thienodolin biosynthesis were elucidated. Feeding a halogenase gene disruption mutant with 6-chloro-and 6-bromotryptophan verified that the tryptophan 6-halogenase gene thdH (identified in the genome of S. albogriseolus in 2006)[11] belongs to the biosyn-thetic gene cluster of thienodolin and that ThdH catalyzes the first step in thienodolin biosynthesis. Identification of ThdD as an amidotransferase catalyzing the conversion of the carboxyl-ic acid group of 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid to the amido group of thienodolin elucidated the last step of the biosynthesis. ThdD amidotransferase activity was shown both in vivo and in vitro. ThdD is one of the very few examples of an amidotransferase in secondary metabolism. The detec-tion of the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster should assist the detection of the enzymes involved in the very unusual sulfur incorporation step and the concomitant formation of the thienoindole ring. Experimental Section Strains, culture conditions and plasmids: The following bacterial strains were used: thienodolin producer S. albogriseolus MJ278-7F,[4, 5] E. coli TG1[38] for subcloning, E. coli ET12567 (pUB307)[39, 40] for inter-species transfer of pHZ1358-based constructs to S. albogriseo-lus, E. coli XL1-Blue MRA (Stratagene) for propagation of the cosmid library, Pseudomonas fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134[8] for het-erologous expression of genes. The growth medium for S. albogri-seolus and mutants for DNA isolation was tryptic soy broth (TSB); the medium described by Kanbe et al.[4] was used for the produc-tion of thienodolin, biosynthetic intermediates, and 6-bromothie-nodolin. Medium A[41] was used as the sporulation medium. Conju-gation of Streptomyces spores was performed by standard proce-dures[42] in mannitol soybean flour medium.[43] E. coli and P. fluores-cens were cultivated in lysogeny broth (LB).[44] If necessary for selective growth, the medium was supplemented with the appro-priate antibiotics. Streptomyces strains were cultivated in the pres-ence of apramycin (5 mg mLNone1 for liquid cultures, 25 mg mLNone1 for solid medium) or nalidixic acid (25 mg mLNone1) ; for E. coli strains ampi-cillin (100 mg mLNone1), apramycin (100 mg mLNone1), chloramphenicol (25 mg mLNone1), kanamycin (25 mg mLNone1), and tetracycline (15 mg mLNone1) were used; for Pseudomonas strains, tetracycline (30 mg mLNone1) and kanamycin (50 mg mLNone1) were used. E. coli strains were grown at 37 8C, Streptomyces and Pseudomonas strains were grown at 30 8C. Liquid cultures were grown under continuous agitation at 150 rpm. For the construction of specific plasmids, the vectors pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene), pLitmus28[45] and pEFBA[46] were used. For gene replacement, the pHZ1358 vector[47] was used, and for the construction of the cosmid library pOJ446[48] were em-ployed, respectively. For gene expression in Pseudomonas, pCIB0[49] was used. General genetic manipulation and PCR: Standard molecular biol-ogy procedures were performed according to protocols described for E. coli[44] and Streptomyces.[42] Plasmid DNA preparation, DNA re-striction/dephosphorylation/ligation, PCR, and Southern hybridiza-tion were performed by following the enzyme and reagent manu-facturers\u2019 protocols: MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania), Roche Diag-nostics, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, PeQLab Biotech (Erlangen, Germany). PCR conditions were 94 8C for 3 min, 35 cycles at 94 8C for 30 s, 55 8C for 1 min, 72 8C for 3 min, and final extension at 72 8C for 5 min. Pfu polymerase (Thermo Scientific) and DMSO (10 %) were used for all amplifications. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). Construction and screening of S. albogriseolus MJ286-76F7 cosmid library: DNA fragments obtained from a partial digestion with Sau3AI were ligated into cosmid pOJ446 digested with BamHI and in vitro packed by using the Gigapack III Gold Packaging Ex-tract Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The resulting E. coli transductants were picked and transferred to 96-well microtiter plates containing LB medium and apramycin. Clones were replicated on LB agar plates containing apramycin. After overnight growth at 37 8C, colonies were transferred to nylon membranes for colony hybridization analysis according to de-scribed methods.[44] The screening of the cosmid clones was per-formed with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled tryptophan 6-halogenase probe, which was obtained by PCR amplification from S. albogriseo-lus with primers ThdH_probe_for (5\u2019-CTGGA TGACT GCGGC GTATC TCGGC AAGGC-3\u2019) and ThdH_probe_rev (5\u2019-CGTGC AACTG ACGCA GCAGG TCATA GGTCG-3\u2019). For labeling of the probe and detection of signals the DIG DNA Labeling and Detection kit (Roche) was used. None 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim ChemBioChem 2014, 15, 1011 \u2013 1020 1017 CHEMBIOCHEM FULL PAPERS www.chembiochem.org DNA Sequencing and computer-assisted sequence analysis: DNA sequencing was performed by Eurofins MWG Operon with the dideoxy chain termination method on ABI 3730XL sequencer. Sequence analysis and comparison of deduced proteins with other known proteins was carried out by using BLAST (http://ncbi.nlm.-nih.gov/blast/). For translation of nucleotide into amino acid se-quences and calculation of protein properties such as molecular mass, programs at the ExPASy Proteomics Server (http://www.ex-pasy.ch/tools/) were used. Sequences were aligned with the pro-gram MultAlin (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/)[50] and col-ored with BOXSHADE 3.21 (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/ BOX_form.html). The sequences thdH, thdD, and thdN have been deposited in GeneBank with accession numbers KC182553, KC182554, and KC182555, respectively. Generation of S. albogriseolus mutant strains: Involvement of the genes thdD, thdH, and thdN in thienodolin biosynthesis was dem-onstrated by gene disruption. For the generation of chromosomal mutants of the thienodolin producer S. albogriseolus MJ286-76F7 by homologous recombination, the gene disruption plasmids pHZ1358 MutH, pHZ1358 MutD and pHZ1358 MutN were con-structed (Figure S3). PCR primers, lengths of the generated frag-ments, and restriction sites for cloning (Table S1) are provided in the Supporting Information. The inactivation plasmids were used to conjugate Streptomyces spores. The conjugation was carried out by biparental conjugation[42] using E. coli ET12567 (pUB307), which contains all genes required for horizontal gene transfer. Twenty hours after conjugation, the plates were overlaid with nalidixic acid to kill E. coli and apramycin to select for S. albogriseolus crossover mutants. After 7 to 10 days, apramycin resistant transformants were obtained. To differentiate double from single crossover mu-tants, apramycin-resistant colonies were replated on solid medium containing thiostreptone (25 mg mLNone1). Thiostreptone-resistant transformants (single crossover events) were neglected; some thio-streptone-sensitive colonies were selected for analysis. Verification of the correct gene replacement was carried out by Southern hy-bridization with the apramycin resistance cassette and the plasmid pHZ1358 as DIG-labeled probes. Analysis of thienodolin production by HPLC: Thienodolin produc-tion in wild-type S. albogriseolus and mutants was monitored by HPLC analysis of culture extracts. Precultures were grown for 3 days in the medium described by Kanbe et al.[4] (50 mL). In the case of mutants, apramycin (5 mg mLNone1) was added. An aliquot (2 mL) of preculture was transferred to fresh Kanbe medium (125 mL) and cultured for 5 days. After separation of cells from cul-ture medium by centrifugation, both culture broth and cells were extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. Subsequently, the organic phases were evaporated, then the respective residues were dissolved in methanol (300 mL) and analyzed by HPLC by using gradient grad1 (see below). Heterologous expression of the amidotransferase gene thdD : The gene thdD was heterologously expressed in Pseudomonas fluo-rescens BL915 DORF1\u20134. For this, the gene was amplified with pri-mers ThdD_for (5\u2019-ATCGA CTAGT CTCAG GAGAT TCCAC CATGT GCGGT ATCGC AGGCT GGGTA GATTT C-3\u2019) and ThdD_rev (5\u2019-ATCGT CTAGA TTCAG ACGTC GACGC GCAGC TCCTG GGACT CCAGC CAGG-3\u2019). Restriction sites SpeI and XbaI are underlined; the ribo-some binding site (shown in bold) is from the P. fluorescens BL915 tryptophan 7-halogenase gene prnA (8 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon of thdD). The gene was amplified by PCR, double-digested with SpeI and XbaI, and ligated into vector pCIB0 (linearized with XbaI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase). After verification of the correct orientation of the gene in the resulting plasmid (pCIB0thdD) by restriction digest, the plasmid was transferred into P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 by electroporation (12.5 kV cmNone1, 5 ms). Cells were grown on LB agar containing kanamycin and tetracycline at 30 8C for 48 h, and some of the colonies were chosen for protein produc-tion analysis. One clone showed significant ThdD production and was selected for further experiments such as protein accumulation and in vivo assays/feeding experiments. Synthesis of 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid (2): The synthesis of 2 was carried out in five steps starting from 6-chlorooxindole. The conversion of 6-chlorooxindole to 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-methylcarboxylic acid in four steps was previously described.[6] The final conversion to 2 was achieved by alkaline hydrolysis with LiOH. For this, 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-methylcarboxylic acid (1.6 mmol) was dissolved in THF/MeOH (4:1, 114 mL) and refluxed for 7 days. After adjusting the pH to 5\u20136 with HCl (2 n) the reaction mixture was extracted three times with CH2Cl2 (120 mL). The organic phases were combined and dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting solid was dissolved in hexane/ethyl acetate (2:8) and purified by chromatography on silica gel. After elution of unreacted 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-methylcarboxylic acid with hexane/ethyl acetate (2:8), 2 was eluted in methanol. Confirmation of the chemical structure by NMR: Samples for NMR spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving the compound (1 mg for 1H NMR, 5 mg for 13C NMR) in [D6]DMSO (1 mL) and trans-ferred into 3 mm NMR tubes. All NMR experiments were recorded at room temperature on an Avance 600 spectrometer (Bruker). Proton and carbon chemical shifts were referenced to the TMS signal. Coupling constants and chemical shifts are given in Hz and ppm, respectively. Feeding experiments: Three feeding experiments were performed. For the formation of 6-bromothienodolin by S. albogriseolus, sodium chloride in the medium described by Kanbe et al.[4] was substituted with sodium bromide. Thienodolin and 6-bromothieno-dolin production in the deletion mutant S. albogriseolus DthdH was achieved by feeding with 6-chlorotryptophan and 6-bromotrypto-phan, respectively. For the in vivo conversion of 2 to thiendolin by the amidotransferase produced by P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0thdD, cultures were fed with chemically synthesized 2. To produce the brominated thienodolin analog 6-bromothienodo-lin, S. albogriseolus was precultured as described above for the pro-duction of thienodolin, but with sodium bromide (5 mm) instead of sodium chloride in the main culture. After 5 days, the culture broth was extracted twice with the same volume of ethyl acetate, then the organic phases were combined and evaporated to dry-ness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in metha-nol (300 mL) and analyzed by HPLC/MS. For chemical complementation of the deletion mutant S. albogri-seolus DthdH by feeding, the strain was precultured for 3 days as described above for the production of thienodolin. The main cul-ture (125 mL) was inoculated with preculture (2 mL) and grown at 28 8C. After 24 h, 6-chlorotryptophan (16 mm) or 6-bromotrypto-phan (16 mm) was added, and cells were cultured for a further 4 days. The culture broth was extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate, and the combined organic phases were evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in methanol (500 mL) and analyzed by HPLC and HPLC/MS. For the conversion of 2 by P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0thdD, the strain was precultured in LB medium (10 mL) con-None 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Preculture (1 mL) was transferred into fresh LB (30 mL) containing the appropriate antibiotics. After culti-vation for 24 h, 2 (5 mg) was added to the culture and cultivated for further 48 h. After separation by centrifugation, both cells and culture broth were extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. The organic phases were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, then the residue was dissolved in methanol (200 mL) and analyzed by HPLC (gradient grad3). As a control, P. flu-orescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0 was treated identically. In vitro activity assay of ThdD: Analysis of the in vitro amidating activity of ThdD was carried out based on an enzyme assay for E. coli asparagine synthetase B (AS-B).[31] With the exception of sub-strate 2, which was dissolved in methanol, all components were dissolved in Tris\u00b7HCl (100 mm, pH 8.0). The assay mixture (160 mL) consisted of 2 (0.5 mm), l-glutamine or NH4OAc (0.5 mm), ATP (0.5 mm), MgCl2 (8 mm) and protein solution (100 mL). All compo-nents were combined and incubated at 30 8C. Subsequently, the re-action was stopped by adding triacetic acid (32 mL, 20 %), precipi-tated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the superna-tant was extracted twice with one volume of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were dried under reduced pressure, then the residue was dissolved in methanol (130 mL) and analyzed by HPLC (gradient grad2). HPLC and HPLC/MS: Analytical and preparative HPLC were per-formed on a preparative HPLC system (Knauer, Berlin, Germany) by using reversed-phase columns at room temperature, and with Eu-rochrom 2000 software (Knauer). For analytical HPLC, a LiChrospher 100 column (RP18, 5 mm, 250 mm None 4.6 mm) was used. Preparative HPLC was performed with a Eurospher 100 column (C18, 5 mm, 250 mm None 20 mm). In both cases, eluent A was water containing NH4OAc (0.5 mm), and eluent B was methanol containing NH4OAc (0.5 mm). For preparative HPLC, a gradient program over 110 min with a flow rate of 5 mL minNone1 was used. The column was equili-brated in 5 % methanol. For elution, the following gradient was applied: 5 % B (7.5 min), 5\u201350 % B (7.5 min), 50 % B (15 min), 50\u2013 70 % B (45 min), 70 % B (15 min), 70\u2013100 % B (7.5 min), 100 % B (12.5 min). Three different gradients were used for analytical HPLC: grad1: flow rate 0.4 mL minNone1, 5 % B (5 min), 5\u2013100 % B (60 min), 100 % B (10 min); grad2: flow rate 0.8 mL minNone1, 5 % B (2.5 min), 5\u2013 100 % B (10 min), 100 % B (12.5 min); grad3: flow rate 0.8 mL minNone1, 5 % B (2.5 min), 5\u2013100 % B (30 min), 100 % B (7.5 min). HPLC/MS was performed on a model 1100 liquid chromatography system (HewlettPackard) linked with a Esquire Ion Trap (ESI/APCI) mass spectrometer (Bruker) running with DataAnalysis 3.0 software (Bruker). Solvents were water and methanol, containing NH4OAc (0.5 mm).

        "Introduction",
        "A variety of natural compounds that show plant growth-regu-lating activities have been isolated from living organisms. Most, such as helminthosporol,[1] sclerin,[2] and spicifernin[3] are secondary metabolites isolated from fungi. During screening for new plant growth-regulating substances in microorgan-isms, such as actinomycetes, a secondary metabolite of Strep-tomyces albogriseolus MJ286-76F7 was isolated (thienodolin, 1; Scheme 1).[4] The structure of this compound was elucidated in the early 1990s by Kanbe et al. as 6-chloro-8H-thieno[2,3-b]-indole-2-carboxamide (molecular formula C11H7N2OClS, M = 250.71 g molNone1) by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analyses.[5] Thienodolin has a unique secondary metabolite structure: a thienoindole skeleton chlorinated at the 6-position of the indole ring. The total chemical synthesis of thienodolin was accomplished in three steps starting from 6-chlorooxin-dole.[6]",
        "The alkaloid thienodolin was the first actinomycete metabo-lite to show concentration-dependent growth-regulating activi-ties in rice seedlings. Growth promotion occurred over the range 1.2\u201312 mm, whereas growth inhibition was evident above 40 mm.[4] It is not known whether the thienoindole skele-ton of thienodolin is essential for its plant growth-regulating activity. A certain structural resemblance of the indole moiety to the auxin indole-3-acetic acid is obvious, but auxin activity could not be determined for thienodolin.[4] Recently, it was shown that thienodolin suppresses nitric oxide synthase and might thus be of pharmaceutical interest.[7] There is currently no information about the biosynthetic pathway of thienodolin. However, because of its structural similarity to tryptophan, it has been proposed that this amino acid could be its precursor, and that (as for other known halogenated secondary metabo-lites derived from tryptophan, like pyrrolnitrin,[8] pyrroindomy-cin,[9] and rebeccamycin)[10] the first biosynthetic step in thieno-dolin biosynthesis might be halogenation of the indole ring of tryptophan catalyzed by a tryptophan 6-halogenase. The iden-tification of a gene coding for a FADH2-dependent tryptophan 6-halogenase[11] in the genome of the thienodolin producer S. albogriseolus supported this hypothesis, but there was no experimental evidence for participation by this enzyme in thie-nodolin biosynthesis.",
        "Here, we investigated the involvement of this tryptophan 6-halogenase in the biosynthesis of thienodolin; we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster, elucidated the last biosynthetic step of thienodolin biosynthesis, and suggest a biosynthetic pathway for thienodolin.",
        "Results Production of thienodolin and 6-bromothienodolin (6-bromothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxamide) by S. albogriseolus Thienodolin was successfully extracted from the culture broth and the mycelium of S. albogriseolus grown in the medium de-scribed by Kanbe et al.[4] Identification of thienodolin was ach-ieved from its characteristic UV absorbance spectrum (lmax = 329.1 nm, 288.6 nm, 271.2 nm (shoulder), 235.7 nm, and by HPLC/MS analysis, which gave a mass (m/z 248.7/250.6 [MNoneH]None ; Figure 1 B) that corresponded to the molecular mass of thienodolin (calculated mass M = 250.00/251.99 g molNone1) as well as the expected fragmentation pattern.",

Three insertional inactivation mutants were generated in the sequenced region to analyze their involvement in thieno-dolin biosynthesis and to functionally characterize specific genes. The gene inactivation experiments together with enzyme assays with enzymes obtained by heterologous ex-pression and feeding studies showed that the first step in thie-nodolin biosynthesis is catalyzed by a tryptophan 6-halogenase and that the last step is the formation of a carboxylic amide group catalyzed by an amidotransferase.

        "Tryptophan 6-halogenase is encoded by thdH ; thdD and thdN putatively encode an amidotransferase and an aminotransfer-ase, respectively. These genes were inactivated by deleting parts of the genes and inserting the apramycin resistance cas-sette acc(3)IV into the gene to be inactivated (see Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Organic extracts of five-day-old cultures of wild-type S. albogriseolus and DthdH, DthdD, and DthdN mutants were prepared and analyzed by HPLC. Thienodolin was produced by wild-type S. albogriseolus (tR = 68 min), but no thienodolin was detected in ethyl acetate extracts from the mutant strains. HPLC-analysis of organic ex-tracts of S. albogriseolus DthdD indicated the presence of three compounds that were absent from wild-type S. albogriseolus : metD1, metD2, and metD3, with retention times (tR) of 45, 78, and 82 min, respectively (Figure 1 A). The major compound, metD1 (tR = 45 min), showed an UV absorbance spectrum very similar to that of thienodolin (Figure 1) with lmax(metD1) = 318.4, 287.8, 266.3, and 237.4 nm (Figure 1 C). The UV spectra of the minor compounds, metD2 and metD3, did not show any similarity to those of thienodolin or tryptophan (data not shown). Thus, metD2 and metD3 were not analyzed in detail. MetD1 was purified by preparative HPLC and further analyzed by HPLC/MS and 1H NMR. HPLC/MS analysis of metD1 (m/z 249.6/251.7 [MNoneH]None) indicated that the molecule contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms and furthermore showed an isotope distribution typical of a monochlorinated compound (Figure 1 C). 1H NMR analysis ([D6]DMSO, 500.13 MHz) gave four signals for aromatic protons: dH = 7.92 ppm (s, 1 H, ArH) ; 7.78 ppm (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 1 H, ArH), 7.48 ppm (d, J = 1.8 Hz, 1 H, ArH), 7.16 ppm (dd, J = 8.4, 1.8 Hz, 1 H, ArH). Comparison of these data with 1H NMR signals obtained for thienodolin[4] to-gether with the similar UV absorption spectra of the two com-pounds (Figure 1 B and C) led to the conclusion that thienodo-lin and metD1 have high structural similarity and that metD1 very likely has a thienoindole skeleton. Given that ThdD might catalyze an amidotransferase reaction, compound metD1 was proposed to be 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid (2 ; Scheme 1) with a molecular mass of M = 250.98/ 252.98 g molNone1 (calculated mass M = 250.98 g molNone1).",

        "ThdH is a flavin-dependent halogenase; it requires a flavin reductase for the formation of the reduced FAD required by the halogenase. A putative flavin reductase gene, thdF, was found in the cluster. However, it has been shown that ThdH, like other flavin-dependent halogenases, accepts free FADH2, and there seems to be no specific association between these two components of the halogenase system.[15, 16] Thus, in vivo, other flavin reductases, which are always present in organisms, can provide reduced flavin for the halogenase.[17] This is consis-tent with the fact that a number of halometabolite biosynthe-sis gene clusters have been identified without a flavin reduc-tase gene.[18, 19] Therefore, it is possible that ThdF is part of a two-component monooxygenase system. The oxygenase part of such a system could be ThdC (an enzyme with homology to cytochrome P450 enzymes) or ThdO (homologous to FAD-dependent oxidoreductases).",
        "Further downstream in the biosynthetic pathway, activation of the a-carbon of 6-chlorotryptophan is necessary. For this activation and the subsequent sulfur incorporation, different reactions can be imagined. Activation of the a-carbon of 6-chlorotryptophan could be achieved by oxidative deamination to 6-chloroindole-3-pyruvate, catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme.[20] A gene coding for such a protein was found in the biosynthetic gene cluster of thienodolin. The protein ThdC shows homology to several cytochrome P450 monooxygenas-es from other Gram-positive bacteria and might catalyze this oxidative deamination. A second route for 6-chloroindole-3-pyruvate formation is an oxidation reaction analogous to the reaction catalyzed by the amino acid oxidases StaO (stauro-sporine biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064)[21] and RebO (rebeccamycin biosynthesis in Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes).[10] These enzymes catalyze the formation of indole-3-pyruvate from tryptophan and 7-chloroindole-3-pyru-vate from 7-chlorotryptophan, respectively, in monooxygenase reactions that release ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. A similar reaction, generating 6-chloroindole-3-pyruvate from 6-chlorotryptophan, seems unlikely for thienodolin biosynthesis, as no gene coding for a protein similar to RebO or StaO was detected in the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster.",
        "The most probable route for a-C activation is an aminotrans-ferase reaction. The enzyme might be encoded by thdN. ThdN shows significant homology to aminotransferases and contains a pyridoxal-5\u2019-phosphate binding motif. In an aminotransferase reaction, the a-amino group of the substrate is transferred to the a-carbon of an a-keto acid (a-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, or pyruvate), thus forming a new a-keto acid from the sub-strate and an amino acid (glutamate or aspartate). In the con-text of the biosynthesis of thienodolin, the putative amino-transferase ThdN would convert 6-chlorotryptophan to 6-chlor-oindole-3-pyruvate, which could then be the substrate for sulfur insertion at the activated a-carbon atom by nucleophilic attack of a sulfur donor, such as a thiocarboxylic acid, a persul-fide or a hydrogen sulfide anion[22, 23] catalyzed by another enzyme. After sulfur incorporation leading to 6-chloroindole-3-thiopyruvate, ring-closure to form the thienoindole skeleton would be necessary; however, no gene coding for an enzyme with putative cyclase activity was found in the thienodolin bio-synthetic gene cluster. Candidates for sulfur insertion and ring closure are ThdM and ThdY (homologous to putative proteins, but with no indication for their function). The subsequent oxi-dation of the new ring might be catalyzed by the potential FAD-dependent oxidase ThdO.",
        "The last step in thienodolin biosynthesis is catalyzed by the 605-residue enzyme ThdD. This shows high homology to vari-ous proteins of the amidotransferase family, which is a special form of the asparagine synthetase family. Asparagine synthe-tase family proteins are found in primary metabolism (mainly in asparagine biosynthesis), but some of them, especially the amidotransferases, also appear in secondary metabolism. A well described example of an amidotransferase in secondary metabolism is the Streptomyces rimosus enzyme OxyD involved in the formation of the malonamate starter unit during oxy-tetracycline biosynthesis.[24] This shows high homology (74 % similarity, 60 % identity) to ThdD. Analysis of the primary struc-ture of ThdD for conserved motifs revealed affiliation to type II asparagine synthetases. ThdD shows the two-domain architec-ture typical for enzymes of this family: an N-terminal glutami-nase domain and a C-terminal synthase domain.[25] Similarly to guanosinemonophosphate synthetase (EC 6.3.5.2)[26] and glu-cosamine 6-phosphate synthetase (EC 2.6.1.16),[27] the two do-mains of ThdD are on a single polypeptide. An example of an amidotransferase with the two domains on separate subunits is carbamoylphosphate synthetase (EC 6.3.5.5).[28] The glutami-nase domain contains a nucleophilic cysteine residue C2, which is highly conserved in all proteins of this family and is essential for the glutamine-hydrolyzing activity of the en-zymes.[29] In this part of the enzyme, glutamine is converted to glutamate and ammonia, which is then transported to the syn-thetase domain where it is used to aminate the substrate in an ATP-dependent reaction. Corresponding to the mechanism common among asparagine synthetases, the substrate is prob-ably activated as a substrate\u2013AMP intermediate.[30] An assay developed to characterize E. coli asparagine synthetase B[31] could be applied to verify in vitro ThdD-catalyzed conversion of 2 to thienodolin. ThdD accepts glutamine as well as free ammonium ions (in the form of ammonium acetate) as the amino group donor. In both cases, thienodolin could be de-tected by HPLC-UV analysis (characteristic UV absorption spec-trum), thereby verifying that ThdD catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of thienodolin.",

        "In analogy to the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin, where the ion exchanger RebU was found to be involved in efflux of the secondary metabolite,[10] a role for ThdA in thienodolin efflux is now proposed. Furthermore, it can be hypothesized that ThdA is necessary to establish and maintain concentration gradients between the extracellular matrix and the cytosol. These gradi-ents and established membrane potentials are the basis for many cellular processes, especially Na+-or H+-dependent sec-ondary transport systems important for uptake or efflux of me-tabolites and other ions.[32] They are important for maintaining the intracellular pH, intracellular ion concentrations and the cell volume of actively metabolizing cells.[33] Besides RebU (re-beccamycin biosynthesis), transporters of this class can be found in the biosynthetic gene clusters of many halogenated secondary metabolites, such as PrnF, AviJ, ComF, and SimEx2 from the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin, avilamycin A, complesta-tin, and simocyclinone D8, respectively.[34\u201337]",

        "Conclusions In this paper, we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster of thie-nodolin, the first growth-regulating compound identified in ac-tinomycetes. Parts of the pathway of thienodolin biosynthesis were elucidated. Feeding a halogenase gene disruption mutant with 6-chloro-and 6-bromotryptophan verified that the tryptophan 6-halogenase gene thdH (identified in the genome of S. albogriseolus in 2006)[11] belongs to the biosyn-thetic gene cluster of thienodolin and that ThdH catalyzes the first step in thienodolin biosynthesis. Identification of ThdD as an amidotransferase catalyzing the conversion of the carboxyl-ic acid group of 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid to the amido group of thienodolin elucidated the last step of the biosynthesis. ThdD amidotransferase activity was shown both in vivo and in vitro. ThdD is one of the very few examples of an amidotransferase in secondary metabolism. The detec-tion of the thienodolin biosynthetic gene cluster should assist the detection of the enzymes involved in the very unusual sulfur incorporation step and the concomitant formation of the thienoindole ring.

The growth medium for S. albogri-seolus and mutants for DNA isolation was tryptic soy broth (TSB); the medium described by Kanbe et al.[4] was used for the produc-tion of thienodolin, biosynthetic intermediates, and 6-bromothie-nodolin. Medium A[41] was used as the sporulation medium. Conju-gation of Streptomyces spores was performed by standard proce-dures[42] in mannitol soybean flour medium.[43] E. coli and P. fluores-cens were cultivated in lysogeny broth (LB).[44] If necessary for selective growth, the medium was supplemented with the appro-priate antibiotics. Streptomyces strains were cultivated in the pres-ence of apramycin (5 mg mLNone1 for liquid cultures, 25 mg mLNone1 for solid medium) or nalidixic acid (25 mg mLNone1) ; for E. coli strains ampi-cillin (100 mg mLNone1), apramycin (100 mg mLNone1), chloramphenicol (25 mg mLNone1), kanamycin (25 mg mLNone1), and tetracycline (15 mg mLNone1) were used; for Pseudomonas strains, tetracycline (30 mg mLNone1) and kanamycin (50 mg mLNone1) were used. E. coli strains were grown at 37 8C, Streptomyces and Pseudomonas strains were grown at 30 8C. Liquid cultures were grown under continuous agitation at 150 rpm. For the construction of specific plasmids, the vectors pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene), pLitmus28[45] and pEFBA[46] were used. For gene replacement, the pHZ1358 vector[47] was used, and for the construction of the cosmid library pOJ446[48] were em-ployed, respectively. For gene expression in Pseudomonas, pCIB0[49] was used. General genetic manipulation and PCR: Standard molecular biol-ogy procedures were performed according to protocols described for E. coli[44] and Streptomyces.[42] Plasmid DNA preparation, DNA re-striction/dephosphorylation/ligation, PCR, and Southern hybridiza-tion were performed by following the enzyme and reagent manu-facturers\u2019 protocols: MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania), Roche Diag-nostics, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, PeQLab Biotech (Erlangen, Germany). PCR conditions were 94 8C for 3 min, 35 cycles at 94 8C for 30 s, 55 8C for 1 min, 72 8C for 3 min, and final extension at 72 8C for 5 min. Pfu polymerase (Thermo Scientific) and DMSO (10 %) were used for all amplifications. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). Construction and screening of S. albogriseolus MJ286-76F7 cosmid library: DNA fragments obtained from a partial digestion with Sau3AI were ligated into cosmid pOJ446 digested with BamHI and in vitro packed by using the Gigapack III Gold Packaging Ex-tract Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The resulting E. coli transductants were picked and transferred to 96-well microtiter plates containing LB medium and apramycin. Clones were replicated on LB agar plates containing apramycin. After overnight growth at 37 8C, colonies were transferred to nylon membranes for colony hybridization analysis according to de-scribed methods.[44] The screening of the cosmid clones was per-formed with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled tryptophan 6-halogenase probe, which was obtained by PCR amplification from S. albogriseo-lus with primers ThdH_probe_for (5\u2019-CTGGA TGACT GCGGC GTATC TCGGC AAGGC-3\u2019) and ThdH_probe_rev (5\u2019-CGTGC AACTG ACGCA GCAGG TCATA GGTCG-3\u2019). For labeling of the probe and detection of signals the DIG DNA Labeling and Detection kit (Roche) was used.",

        "DNA Sequencing and computer-assisted sequence analysis: DNA sequencing was performed by Eurofins MWG Operon with the dideoxy chain termination method on ABI 3730XL sequencer. Sequence analysis and comparison of deduced proteins with other known proteins was carried out by using BLAST (http://ncbi.nlm.-nih.gov/blast/). For translation of nucleotide into amino acid se-quences and calculation of protein properties such as molecular mass, programs at the ExPASy Proteomics Server (http://www.ex-pasy.ch/tools/) were used. Sequences were aligned with the pro-gram MultAlin (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/)[50] and col-ored with BOXSHADE 3.21 (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/ BOX_form.html). The sequences thdH, thdD, and thdN have been deposited in GeneBank with accession numbers KC182553, KC182554, and KC182555, respectively. Generation of S. albogriseolus mutant strains: Involvement of the genes thdD, thdH, and thdN in thienodolin biosynthesis was dem-onstrated by gene disruption. For the generation of chromosomal mutants of the thienodolin producer S. albogriseolus MJ286-76F7 by homologous recombination, the gene disruption plasmids pHZ1358 MutH, pHZ1358 MutD and pHZ1358 MutN were con-structed (Figure S3). PCR primers, lengths of the generated frag-ments, and restriction sites for cloning (Table S1) are provided in the Supporting Information. The inactivation plasmids were used to conjugate Streptomyces spores. The conjugation was carried out by biparental conjugation[42] using E. coli ET12567 (pUB307), which contains all genes required for horizontal gene transfer. Twenty hours after conjugation, the plates were overlaid with nalidixic acid to kill E. coli and apramycin to select for S. albogriseolus crossover mutants. After 7 to 10 days, apramycin resistant transformants were obtained. To differentiate double from single crossover mu-tants, apramycin-resistant colonies were replated on solid medium containing thiostreptone (25 mg mLNone1). Thiostreptone-resistant transformants (single crossover events) were neglected; some thio-streptone-sensitive colonies were selected for analysis. Verification of the correct gene replacement was carried out by Southern hy-bridization with the apramycin resistance cassette and the plasmid pHZ1358 as DIG-labeled probes. Analysis of thienodolin production by HPLC: Thienodolin produc-tion in wild-type S. albogriseolus and mutants was monitored by HPLC analysis of culture extracts. Precultures were grown for 3 days in the medium described by Kanbe et al.[4] (50 mL). In the case of mutants, apramycin (5 mg mLNone1) was added. An aliquot (2 mL) of preculture was transferred to fresh Kanbe medium (125 mL) and cultured for 5 days. After separation of cells from cul-ture medium by centrifugation, both culture broth and cells were extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. Subsequently, the organic phases were evaporated, then the respective residues were dissolved in methanol (300 mL) and analyzed by HPLC by using gradient grad1 (see below). Heterologous expression of the amidotransferase gene thdD : The gene thdD was heterologously expressed in Pseudomonas fluo-rescens BL915 DORF1\u20134. For this, the gene was amplified with pri-mers ThdD_for (5\u2019-ATCGA CTAGT CTCAG GAGAT TCCAC CATGT GCGGT ATCGC AGGCT GGGTA GATTT C-3\u2019) and ThdD_rev (5\u2019-ATCGT CTAGA TTCAG ACGTC GACGC GCAGC TCCTG GGACT CCAGC CAGG-3\u2019). Restriction sites SpeI and XbaI are underlined; the ribo-some binding site (shown in bold) is from the P. fluorescens BL915 tryptophan 7-halogenase gene prnA (8 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon of thdD). The gene was amplified by PCR, double-digested with SpeI and XbaI, and ligated into vector pCIB0 (linearized with XbaI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase). After verification of the correct orientation of the gene in the resulting plasmid (pCIB0thdD) by restriction digest, the plasmid was transferred into P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 by electroporation (12.5 kV cmNone1, 5 ms). Cells were grown on LB agar containing kanamycin and tetracycline at 30 8C for 48 h, and some of the colonies were chosen for protein produc-tion analysis. One clone showed significant ThdD production and was selected for further experiments such as protein accumulation and in vivo assays/feeding experiments. Synthesis of 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid (2): The synthesis of 2 was carried out in five steps starting from 6-chlorooxindole. The conversion of 6-chlorooxindole to 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-methylcarboxylic acid in four steps was previously described.[6] The final conversion to 2 was achieved by alkaline hydrolysis with LiOH. For this, 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-methylcarboxylic acid (1.6 mmol) was dissolved in THF/MeOH (4:1, 114 mL) and refluxed for 7 days. After adjusting the pH to 5\u20136 with HCl (2 n) the reaction mixture was extracted three times with CH2Cl2 (120 mL). The organic phases were combined and dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting solid was dissolved in hexane/ethyl acetate (2:8) and purified by chromatography on silica gel. After elution of unreacted 6-chlorothieno[2,3-b]indole-2-methylcarboxylic acid with hexane/ethyl acetate (2:8), 2 was eluted in methanol. Confirmation of the chemical structure by NMR: Samples for NMR spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving the compound (1 mg for 1H NMR, 5 mg for 13C NMR) in [D6]DMSO (1 mL) and trans-ferred into 3 mm NMR tubes. All NMR experiments were recorded at room temperature on an Avance 600 spectrometer (Bruker). Proton and carbon chemical shifts were referenced to the TMS signal. Coupling constants and chemical shifts are given in Hz and ppm, respectively. Feeding experiments: Three feeding experiments were performed. For the formation of 6-bromothienodolin by S. albogriseolus, sodium chloride in the medium described by Kanbe et al.[4] was substituted with sodium bromide. Thienodolin and 6-bromothieno-dolin production in the deletion mutant S. albogriseolus DthdH was achieved by feeding with 6-chlorotryptophan and 6-bromotrypto-phan, respectively. For the in vivo conversion of 2 to thiendolin by the amidotransferase produced by P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0thdD, cultures were fed with chemically synthesized 2. To produce the brominated thienodolin analog 6-bromothienodo-lin, S. albogriseolus was precultured as described above for the pro-duction of thienodolin, but with sodium bromide (5 mm) instead of sodium chloride in the main culture. After 5 days, the culture broth was extracted twice with the same volume of ethyl acetate, then the organic phases were combined and evaporated to dry-ness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in metha-nol (300 mL) and analyzed by HPLC/MS. For chemical complementation of the deletion mutant S. albogri-seolus DthdH by feeding, the strain was precultured for 3 days as described above for the production of thienodolin. The main cul-ture (125 mL) was inoculated with preculture (2 mL) and grown at 28 8C. After 24 h, 6-chlorotryptophan (16 mm) or 6-bromotrypto-phan (16 mm) was added, and cells were cultured for a further 4 days. The culture broth was extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate, and the combined organic phases were evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in methanol (500 mL) and analyzed by HPLC and HPLC/MS. For the conversion of 2 by P. fluorescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0thdD, the strain was precultured in LB medium (10 mL) con-",

        "taining the appropriate antibiotics and grown overnight at 30 8C with shaking (150 rpm). Preculture (1 mL) was transferred into fresh LB (30 mL) containing the appropriate antibiotics. After culti-vation for 24 h, 2 (5 mg) was added to the culture and cultivated for further 48 h. After separation by centrifugation, both cells and culture broth were extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. The organic phases were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, then the residue was dissolved in methanol (200 mL) and analyzed by HPLC (gradient grad3). As a control, P. flu-orescens BL915 DORF1\u20134 pCIB0 was treated identically. In vitro activity assay of ThdD: Analysis of the in vitro amidating activity of ThdD was carried out based on an enzyme assay for E. coli asparagine synthetase B (AS-B).[31] With the exception of sub-strate 2, which was dissolved in methanol, all components were dissolved in Tris\u00b7HCl (100 mm, pH 8.0). The assay mixture (160 mL) consisted of 2 (0.5 mm), l-glutamine or NH4OAc (0.5 mm), ATP (0.5 mm), MgCl2 (8 mm) and protein solution (100 mL). All compo-nents were combined and incubated at 30 8C. Subsequently, the re-action was stopped by adding triacetic acid (32 mL, 20 %), precipi-tated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the superna-tant was extracted twice with one volume of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were dried under reduced pressure, then the residue was dissolved in methanol (130 mL) and analyzed by HPLC (gradient grad2). HPLC and HPLC/MS: Analytical and preparative HPLC were per-formed on a preparative HPLC system (Knauer, Berlin, Germany) by using reversed-phase columns at room temperature, and with Eu-rochrom 2000 software (Knauer). For analytical HPLC, a LiChrospher 100 column (RP18, 5 mm, 250 mm None 4.6 mm) was used. Preparative HPLC was performed with a Eurospher 100 column (C18, 5 mm, 250 mm None 20 mm). In both cases, eluent A was water containing NH4OAc (0.5 mm), and eluent B was methanol containing NH4OAc (0.5 mm). For preparative HPLC, a gradient program over 110 min with a flow rate of 5 mL minNone1 was used. The column was equili-brated in 5 % methanol. For elution, the following gradient was applied: 5 % B (7.5 min), 5\u201350 % B (7.5 min), 50 % B (15 min), 50\u2013 70 % B (45 min), 70 % B (15 min), 70\u2013100 % B (7.5 min), 100 % B (12.5 min). Three different gradients were used for analytical HPLC: grad1: flow rate 0.4 mL minNone1, 5 % B (5 min), 5\u2013100 % B (60 min), 100 % B (10 min); grad2: flow rate 0.8 mL minNone1, 5 % B (2.5 min), 5\u2013 100 % B (10 min), 100 % B (12.5 min); grad3: flow rate 0.8 mL minNone1, 5 % B (2.5 min), 5\u2013100 % B (30 min), 100 % B (7.5 min). HPLC/MS was performed on a model 1100 liquid chromatography system (HewlettPackard) linked with a Esquire Ion Trap (ESI/APCI) mass spectrometer (Bruker) running with DataAnalysis 3.0 software (Bruker). Solvents were water and methanol, containing NH4OAc (0.5 mm).",
