Nonetheless, the total number of halometabo-lites reported so far reaches almost 4000 (3700 document-ed by Gribble [1]), with the antibiotics, vancomycin [2] and chloramphenicol, or the 20S proteasome inhibitor and potential anticancer agent, salinosporamide A [3] most prominent among them. Majority of the halogenated natural compounds derive from prokaryotes or marine organisms and contain, in the main, bromine or chlorine substituents [4]. Higher plants, principal contributors to the remarkable diversity of natural products, are (so far) considered relatively devoid of halogenated structures. The very few examples of plant halometabolites include fluoracetate from Acacia georginae [5] or 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid, a halogenated auxin from pea [6].Research ArticleRecombinant\u2002flavin-dependent\u2002halogenases\u2002are\u2002functional in\u2002tobacco\u2002chloroplasts\u2002without\u2002co-expression\u2002of\u2002flavin reductase\u2002genes Sabine Fr\u00e4bel1, Markus Krischke2, Agata Staniek1 and Heribert Warzecha11 Plant Biotechnology and Metabolic Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany2 Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Pharmazeutische Biologie, Julius-von-Sachs-Institut der Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, GermanyHalogenation of natural compounds in planta is rare. Herein, a successful engineering of trypto-phan 6-halogenation into the plant context by heterologous expression of the Streptomyces toxytr-icini Stth gene and localization of its enzymatic product in various tobacco cell compartments is described. When co-expressed with the flavin reductase rebF from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes, Stth efficiently produced chlorinated tryptophan in the cytosol. Further, supplementation of KBr yielded the brominated metabolite. More strikingly, targeting of the protein to the chloroplasts enabled effective halogenation of tryptophan even in absence of the partner reductase, providing crucial evidence for sufficient, organelle-specific supply of the FADH2 cofactor to drive halogen integration. Incorporation of an alternative enzyme, the 7-halogenase RebH from L. aerocolonige-nes, into the metabolic set-up resulted in the formation of 6,7-dichlorotryptophan. Finally, expres-sion of tryptophan decarboxylase (tdc) in concert with stth led to the generation of 6-chlorot-ryptamine, a new-to-nature precursor of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. In sum, the report highlights the tremendous application potential of plants as a unique chassis for the engineering of rare and valuable halogenated natural products, with chloroplasts as the cache of reduction equivalents driving metabolic reactions.Keywords: Combinatorial biosynthesis \u00b7 Flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases \u00b7 Plant metabolic engineering \u00b7 Plant natural products \u00b7 Synthetic biologyCorrespondence: Prof. Heribert Warzecha, Plant Biotechnology and Metabolic Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Schnittspahn-stra\u00dfe 3-5, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany E-mail: warzecha@bio.tu-darmstadt.deAbbreviations:\u2002BFP, blue fluorescent protein; cp, chloroplast; ER, endoplas-mic reticulum; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide (quinone, oxidized form); FADH2, flavin adenine dinucleotide (hydroquinone, reduced form); FW, fresh weight; GB2.0, GoldenBraid 2.0; HPLC, high-performance liquid chro-matography; KBr, potassium bromide; MIAs, monoterpenoid indole alka-loids; MS, mass spectrometry; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form); PyrH, tryptophan 5-halogenase from Streptomyces rugospo-rus; RebF, flavin reductase from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes; RebH, trypto-phan 7-halogenase from L. aerocolonigenes; Stth, tryptophan 6-halogenase from Streptomyces toxytricini; TDC, tryptophan decarboxylase; tR, retention time; TU, transcriptional unit; UPLC, ultra-performance liquid chromatog-raphy; YFP, yellow fluorescent proteinReceived 18 MAY 2016Revised 27 SEP 2016Accepted 28 SEP 2016Accepted article online 30 SEP 2016Supporting\u2002information available\u2002online \u00a9 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1587 www.biotecvisions.comwww.biotechnology-journal.com Biotechnology Journal Biotechnol. J. 2016, 11, 1586\u20131594The importance of many halogenated products from prokaryotes and fungi lies in their often pronounced bio-logical and pharmacological effects, driving progress in the investigation of their biosynthetic pathways. Recent identification of an array of halogenating enzymes and cloning of the corresponding genes enabled thorough characterization and grouping of the catalysts into dis-tinct classes. Haloperoxidases, for example, utilize hydro-gen peroxide and halide ions to produce hypohalous acids, freely diffusible halogenating agents able to attack susceptible organic molecules. These enzymes, therefore, lack substrate specificity and regioselectivity [7]. In con-trast, the subsequently discovered class of flavin-depen-dent halogenases seems to play a vital role in the biosyn-thesis of a substantive number of natural products, with its representatives displaying high substrate specificity and/or regioselectivity [8]. In general, flavin-dependent halogenases require FADH2 to introduce a halogen atom into an organic molecule, given that the structure of the latter encompasses a double bond susceptible to electro-philic substitution [8]. Supply of the cofactor, via NADH-driven reduction of FAD, falls to a cooperating enzyme, flavin reductase. Although functionally linked, the cata-lytic partners need not derive from the same organism or biosynthetic gene cluster. As reported by Zeng and Zhan, the in vitro catalytic activity of tryptophan 6-halogenase Stth from Streptomyces toxytricini was maintained while bolstered by Fre, a flavin-reductase from E. coli, confirm-ing that a heterologous, yet similar, enzyme was sufficient to provide FADH2 and efficiently augment halogenation of tryptophan [9].The fact that many halogenating enzyme systems affording introduction of novel functionalities into ame-nable molecules are now at hand opens the possibility of combinatorial biosynthesis of new-to-nature compounds in heterologous contexts. In this light, the halogenases acting on tryptophan and its derivatives emerge as cata-lysts of considerable interest. Plants produce a plethora of tryptophan-derived metabolites, crucially exemplified by the vast array of indole alkaloids encompassing many potent pharmacological agents [10, 11]. Introduction of halides into these structures might result in altered plant products with modified activities or offer new prospects for subsequent synthetic customization steps [12]. In their ground-breaking work, the group of O\u2019Connor integrated two flavin-dependent halogenases from soil bacteria, RebH and PyrH, into the biosynthetic pathway of mono-terpenoid indole alkaloids in the medicinal plant, Cathar-anthus roseus [13].To fully capitalize on the potential of plants to provide a versatile and compelling platform for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, their inherent complexity as multicellular organisms with highly compartmentalized cells needs to be taken into account. Further, plant bio-synthetic pathways are intricate networks regulated on temporal and spatial levels [14]. Hence, consolidation of biosynthetic enzymes into novel multi-faceted metabolic circuits might require individual fine-tuning of their local-ization within a plant cell. Consequently, metabolic engi-neering endeavors call for in-depth investigation of high numbers of permutations of combined genes, targeting sequences and promoters to establish the optimal context for production of the desired molecule(s). In recent years, modular cloning technologies for metabolic engineering, enabling fast and reliable assembly of multiple expression constructs from a limited set of standardized building blocks, have been proposed [15]. Among them, the inter-compatible GoldenBraid (GB) and MoClo standards proved especially useful in plant synthetic biology approaches, spurring the development of effective pro-moter shuffling strategies [16] and CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing tools [17] facilitating designer transcrip-tional regulation as well as helping to tackle the intrica-cies of plastome engineering [18].In the present study, we set out to expand the reper-toire of tryptophan halogenases amenable for plant syn-thetic biology-driven redesign. To this end, we elected to examine the engineering potential of the aforementioned, recently discovered tryptophan 6-halogenase from S. toxytricini, Stth [9]. To further expand the characteriza-tion of catalytic properties of the enzyme, we introduced it into the GoldenBraid context and investigated the effect of divergent subcellular localization on product for-mation. We further addressed the ability of Stth to provide precursors for monoterpenoid indole alkaloid formation in a combinatorial biosynthetic approach.2\u2002 \u2002 Materials\u2002and\u2002methods 2.1\u2002 \u2002 Chemicals 5-DL-chlorotryptophan, 6-DL-bromotryptophan and 7-DL-bromotryptophan used as standards for identification of RebH and Stth products were purchased from Carbosynth (Berkshire, UK). 6-DL-chlorotryptophan and 5-DL-bromo-tryptophan were procured from Biosynth (Staad, Switzer-land). 2.2\u2002 \u2002 Genetic\u2002material DNA constructs encompassing the coding sequences of RebH from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes (GenBank AB071405.1, part of gene cluster) and TDC from C. roseus (GenBank X67662.1) were kindly provided by Prof. Sarah E. O\u2019Connor from the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK and Prof. Johan Memelink from the Leiden University, the Netherlands, respectively. In addition, GB-customized stth deriving from S. toxytricini (GenBank HQ844046.1) and rebF from L. aerocolonigenes (GenBank AB071405.1, part of gene cluster) were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, 1588 \u00a9 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

J. 2016, 11, 1586\u201315942.3\u2002 \u2002 Bacterial\u2002strains\u2002and\u2002growth\u2002conditions E. coli DH5\u03b1 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) or TOP10 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), used for cloning of DNA constructs, were cultivated at 37\u00b0C in lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with relevant antibiotics and, when appropriate, 40\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside acid (X-Gal, Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) [19]. Transient trans-formation of Nicotiana benthamiana plants was per-formed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 cells (ICON Genetics, Halle, Germany) grown at 28\u00b0C in LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics [19] as well as rifampicin (50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and 100\u00a0\u00b5M 3,5-dime-thoxy-4-hydroxyacetophenone (acetosyringone, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).2.4\u2002 \u2002 Cloning\u2002of\u2002DNA\u2002constructs All DNA constructs used for transient transformation of N.\u00a0benthamiana plants were assembled using the Gold-enBraid 2.0 (GB2.0) cloning technique [19]. For domesti-cation in the pUPD vector, the relevant sequences were amplified by means of PCR ascertaining addition of appropriate fusion sites and BsmBI recognition sites as well as removal of internal BsmBI and BsaI recognition sites (Supporting information, Table\u00a0S1). To afford chlo-roplast localization of recombinant enzymes, stth, rebH and rebF were fused to a chloroplast transit peptide sequence (cp), a consensus of dicot sequences, originat-ing from the pICH20030 plasmid (ICON Genetics, Halle, Germany, [20]). For the transport of halogenases to the apoplast, stth and rebH were fused to the signaling pep-tide sequence of calreticulin (er) from Arabidopsis thali-ana, as featured in the pICH17620 plasmid (ICON Genet-ics, Halle, Germany, [20]). Expression of cp-and er-fused stth and rebH was regulated by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (P35S, GB0030) and the nopaline synthase terminator (TNos, GB0037) from A. tumefaciens, while the cp-and er-fused rebF was ligated to the polyubiquitin 3 promoter (PUbq3, GB0272) and the actin terminator (TAct2, GB0210) from A. thaliana. To simplify the cloning procedure of the respective genes encoding cytosol-bound catalysts, a modified P35S mod-ule, spanning positions 01\u201313 of the GoldenBraid TU build-up (Fig.\u00a01, [19]), was generated. For verification of successful biosynthesis of recombinant enzymes, stth and rebH were fused with yfp (GB0024) and rebF was ligated to bfp (GB0043), with the fluorescent partner-protein coding regions occupying position 16 in the TU structure (Fig.\u00a01). The GB2.0 \u03b1 level-assembled tran-scriptional units (TUs) were further combined within \u03a9 level vector backbones, yielding appropriate multigene constructs.

Overnight cultures of A. tumefaciens EHA105 cells carry-ing the genes of interest (as well as the pDGB2\u03b12 empty vector, EV serving as a negative control) were centrifuged at 8000\u00a0\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min and the cell pellet was resuspended in the infiltration buffer (10\u00a0mM MES, 10\u00a0mM MgSO4, 100\u00a0 \u00b5M acetosyringone, pH\u00a05.5) to the final OD600 of 1. Bacterial suspensions were infiltrated into leaves (on their abaxial side) of four-week-old plants using a syringe with-out a needle; all infiltrations were performed in three bio-logical replicates. In case of co-infiltration of alternative individual Agrobacterium cultures, the ratios of all rele-vant constructs were kept constant within each experi-ment. To analyze brominating potential of the investi-gated halogenases, the infiltration buffer was supple-mented with 40\u00a0mM KBr (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The plants were incubated for four to six days and suc-cessful biosynthesis of recombinant enzymes was veri-fied post-transformation by fluorescence microscopy (Axioskop 40, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).2.6\u2002 \u2002 \u2002Chromatographic\u2002analysis\u2002of\u2002halogenated metabolites For the extraction of metabolites from plant samples, 100\u00a0mg of frozen leaf powder were homogenized by soni-cation in 200\u00a0\u00b5L of 80% v/v methanol for 30\u00a0min. Subse-quently, the extracts were purified two times from solid particles by centrifugation at 17\u00a0000\u00a0\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. 10\u00a0\u00b5L of each leaf extract were injected onto a 150\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.6\u00a0mm, 5\u00a0\u00b5m analytical HPLC column (Zorbax 300SB-C18, Agi-lent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) embedded within the 1260 Infinity HPLC system (G1379B micro vacuum degasser, G1312B binary pump, G1329B autosampler, G1316A col-umn thermostat, G4212B diode array detector, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Metabolites were separated at the flow rate of 1\u00a0mL/min and column temperature of 30\u00b0C using 0.1% v/v formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) as a mobile phase. The following nonlinear mobile phase gra-dient (% B) was used for the analyses: 0\u20134\u00a0min, 10; 4\u20139\u00a0min, 10 to 30; 9\u201312\u00a0min 30. Finally, the column was flushed with 100% B for 3\u00a0min and re-equilibrated with 10% B for additional 3\u00a0min. Tryptophan derivatives were detected at the wavelength of 280\u00a0nm. Further investiga-tion was conducted by means of the Acquity UPLC sys-tem (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to the Micromass Quattro Premier triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). For LC-MS analyses, 10\u00a0\u00b5L of plant extracts were injected onto the Acquity UPLC BEH C18 analytical column (100 \u00d7 2.1\u00a0mm, 1.7\u00a0\u00b5m, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with the BEH C18 VanGuard pre-column (2.1 \u00d7 5\u00a0mm, 1.7\u00a0\u00b5m, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The column temperature was set at 40\u00b0C and the flow rate at 0.25\u00a0mL/min. The mobile phase was com-posed of 0.1% v/v formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) and the analyses were performed with the following nonlinear mobile phase gradient (% B): 0.0\u20132.0\u00a0min, 10; 2.0\u20134.5\u00a0min, 10 to 30; 4.5\u20136.0\u00a0min, 30; 6.0\u20136.5\u00a0min, 30 to 100. All remaining molecules were eluted with 100% B for 1.5\u00a0min and the column was re-equilibrated with 10% B for 2\u00a0min. Metabolites were detected in the positive ESI mode with a full scan MS experiment (m/z 50\u20131000). Nitrogen was applied as the desolvation gas (400\u00b0C, 800\u00a0L/h) and cone gas (10\u00a0L/h). The capillary voltage was 2.75\u00a0kV and the cone voltage was set to 25\u00a0V.3\u2002 \u2002 Results To evaluate the functionality of Stth in planta, we antici-pated screening a considerable number of clones, to wit, combinations of various genes as well as targeting sequences for subcellular localization. To alleviate the cloning effort and enable aggregation of a large number of pathway permutations, we applied the GoldenBraid standard for the design and assembly of expression con-structs [19, 21]. Figure\u00a01 depicts the general assembly scheme. Final vectors were mobilized into Agrobacterium for transient transformation of N. benthamiana plants. Expression of genes of interest in tobacco leaves was evaluated by monitoring the presence of fluorescent pro-teins serving as fusion partners of the target polypeptide molecules. Plant material was harvested, extracted and analyzed for metabolite formation by HPLC and UPLC-MS. 3.1\u2002 \u2002 \u2002Stth\u2002is\u2002active\u2002in\u2002plants\u2002and forms\u20026-chlorotryptophan To test our experimental set-up and the ability of Stth to perform tryptophan halogenation in tobacco leaves, we utilized the gene encoding RebH as a positive control. RebH was shown to function in C. roseus when its coding sequence was co-expressed with that of a corresponding flavin reductase, RebF [22]; the latter, essential for the generation of FADH2 ascertaining halogenase activity. As the catalytic capacity of Stth was confirmed also in the presence of an unrelated flavin reductase [9], we incorpo-rated rebF to our expression strategy to provide the recombinant Stth with the necessary partner reductase.Transient expression of rebH together with rebF facilitating cytosolic localization of the encoded proteins resulted in the formation of a new metabolite, absent from control samples, that exhibited an HPLC tR value of 7.9\u00a0min (Fig.\u00a02B). UV-absorption spectrum of the molecule was similar to that of tryptophan (220\u00a0nm, 280\u00a0nm), featur-ing two maxima at 222 and 283\u00a0nm (Supporting 1590 \u00a9 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheimwww.biotechnology-journal.com www.biotecvisions.com Biotechnology Journal Biotechnol. J. 2016, 11, 1586\u20131594tion, Fig.\u00a0S1). The observed shift could be attributed to substitution of a chloride ion into the heteroaromatic ring system. Further LC-MS analyses revealed an m/z value of 239 in the positive ionization mode. Although unequivo-cal identification of the metabolite was impeded by the lack of the relevant standard compound, the obtained evidence emphatically pointed to it being 7-chlorotrypto-phan. This outcome was in clear accord with previous results obtained for C. roseus, confirming tobacco as a suitable host for functional recombinant RebH/RebF tan-dem. Subsequent substitution of rebH with stth led to iden-tification of an alternative metabolite eluting after 8.3\u00a0min, characterized by a mass spectrum exhibiting two m/z values of 239 and 241 consistent with those of mono-chlorinated tryptophan (Fig.\u00a02C) and absorbing UV light at 227 and 284\u00a0nm (Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S2). Thus, detection of 6-chlorotryptophan, as synthesized by recom-binant Stth, was corroborated.For the conclusive authentication of tryptophan deriv-atives synthesized by Stth and RebH, retention time val-ues of 6-and 7-chlorotryptophan, as detected in plant extracts, were compared to those of relevant standard compounds by means of LC-MS, using a modified nonlin-ear mobile phase gradient (Supporting information, sup-porting materials and methods). Due to the unavailability of the 7-chlorotryptophan reference metabolite, plant extracts characteristic of cytosolic RebH were spiked with 5-and 6-chlorotryptophan. However, as 7-, 5-and 6-chlorotryptophan derivatives were not separated effi-ciently under the applied LC conditions, revealing tR val-ues of 5.21\u00a0min, 5.31\u00a0min and 5.59\u00a0min, respectively (Sup-porting information, Fig.\u00a0S3 upper panel), proof of regio-specific halogenation by Stth and RebH was obtained through comparative analysis with brominated trypto-phan standard compounds (Section 3.2).3.2\u2002 \u2002 Bromination Since both halogenases were reported capable of intro-ducing bromide ions into the tryptophan scaffold in vitro [9, 22], we set out to examine whether the activity was heterologously translated into plants. Therefore, KBr solu-tion (40\u00a0mM) was co-infiltrated along with Agrobacterium Figure\u20022.\u2002 UPLC-MS analysis of plant extracts after infiltration with differentially targeted halogenase and reductase constructs.

J. 2016, 11, 1586\u20131594cells harboring the respective halogenase expression constructs. As shown in Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S4, brominated tryptophan was detected upon analysis of extracts from stth-and rebH-infiltrated plants. Mass spec-tra of the newly generated 6-and 7-substituted amino acid molecule exhibited m/z values of 283 and 285, with identical signal intensities consistent with those charac-teristic of a mono-brominated tryptophan structure.LC-separation of authentic 7-, 5-and 6-bromotrypto-phan was sufficient for effective metabolite identification, with their respective tR values of 5.94\u00a0min, 6.11\u00a0min and 6.35\u00a0 min (Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S3 lower panel) consistent with those recorded for the putative 7-and 6-bromotryptophan synthesized by RebH and Stth after KBr supplementation. Additionally, extracts of stth-and rebH-infiltrated plants, containing the putative 6-chloro-, 6-bromo-or 7-bromotryptophan, were enriched with the appropriate standard compounds and analyzed by LC-MS. The increase of peak areas in the spiked extracts further confirmed regioselective halogenation of the ami-no acid substrate by the investigated recombinant enzymes (Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S5\u2013S7).Quantification of halotryptophans (Supporting infor-mation, supporting materials and methods) revealed cytosolic 7-and 6-chlorotryptophan levels reaching 77.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.6\u00a0ng/mg FW (fresh weight) and 70.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.0\u00a0ng/mg FW, respectively, five days after infiltration. Following KBr supplementation, the respective 7-and 6-bromotryp-tophan concentrations amounted to 81.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0ng/mg FW and 42.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.4\u00a0ng/mg FW, within the same incubation period. 3.3\u2002 \u2002 \u2002Cooperativity\u2002of\u2002bacterial\u2002halogenases with\u2002plant\u2002flavin\u2002reductases Using the modular set-up of expression construct design, we further evaluated the effect of varied subcellular localization of RebH/RebF and Stth/RebF on their cata-lytic activity. When either of the halogenase/reductase combination was targeted to the chloroplasts, the respective specific products, 7-and 6-chlorotryptophan were detected (Fig.\u00a02B and 2C). In contrast, directing them to the ER/apoplastic space yielded no significant amounts of chlorinated tryptophan (data not shown). To verify the correct subcellular localization of the haloge-nases, fusions of either RebH or Stth with YFP were visualized under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S8 and supporting materi-als and methods).To determine whether plants contain endogenous flavin reductases able to cooperate with the investigated bacterial halogenases, or if free FADH2 is present in suf-ficient amounts, we tested the functionality of RebH and Stth without co-expression of rebF. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D and 2E, the specific products, 6-and 7-chlorotryptophan were detected after sole expression of stth and rebH, respectively, but only in trace amounts when the enzymes were located in the cytosol. On the other hand, targeting the halogenases to the chloroplasts resulted in significant yields of the relevant tryptophan derivatives, comparable to those augmented by the recombinant cytosolic RebF. The outcome points to plastids as a valuable cache of reduction equivalents driving metabolic reactions.3.4\u2002 \u2002 \u2002Concerted\u2002activity\u2002of\u2002Stth\u2002and\u2002RebH\u2002leads to\u2002formation\u2002of\u20026,7-halotryptophan Next, we wished to examine if a combination of the two halogenases yielded di-halogenated tryptophan. Their capacity to introduce a second chloride atom to the chlo-rinated amino acid molecule was investigated by tran-sient co-transformation of N. benthamiana with rebH and stth. To evaluate the biosynthesis of dichlorotryptophan in the cytosol, both halogenases were co-localized with the partner reductase, RebF. Additionally, tandem halo-genation in chloroplasts was analyzed without RebF. Besides the formation of 6-and 7-chlorotryptophan, co-localization of Stth and RebH correlated with accumula-tion of a third metabolite, eluting after 10.36\u00a0min in HPLC analyses (Fig.\u00a02F). Further LC-MS investigation revealed an m/z value of 273 in positive ionization mode, while the relevant isotope pattern gave proof of effective dichloro-tryptophan biosynthesis in planta (Supporting informa-tion, Fig.\u00a0S9). Interestingly, trace amounts of the molecule were also detectable in control samples representative of RebH alone, suggesting that the enzyme exhibits residu-al activity toward 6-halogenation and is, to some extent, capable of producing dichlorotryptophan [23]. This became evident upon analysis by UPLC-MS (Supporting informa-tion, Fig.\u00a0S10). While Stth produced solely 6-chlorotrypto-phan, RebH-containing plants accumulated 6,7-dichloro-tryptophan as well.The tandem activity of RebH and Stth was also exam-ined after co-transformation of both relevant gene con-structs and subsequent infiltration of 40\u00a0mM KBr. Com-pared to negative control samples, co-expression of rebH and stth correlated with the formation of a novel metabo-lite that eluted after 5.97\u00a0min and revealed m/z values of 361, 363 and 365 with signal intensity ratios of 1:2:1, compatible with a di-brominated tryptophan molecule (Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S11). Moreover, an alterna-tive metabolite exhibiting a tR value of 5.83\u00a0min and m/z values of 317, 319 and 321 was observed (Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S11). According to the detected mass and the characteristic mass spectrum, this molecule was, most likely, that of a mono-chlorinated and mono-bromi-nated tryptophan.Finally, biosynthesis of the observed metabolites occurred independently of co-localization of both haloge-nases in chloroplasts or the cytosol, showing that subcel-lular context had no bearing on enzyme activity as long as the abundance of reducing equivalents was 1592 \u00a9 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

J. 2016, 11, 1586\u201315943.5\u2002 \u2002 \u2002Formation\u2002of\u2002halogenated\u2002tryptamine, a\u2002precursor\u2002of\u2002monoterpenoid\u2002indole\u2002alkaloids Tryptophan is a vital precursor driving biosynthesis of numerous specialized plant metabolites. We, therefore, addressed the question of integration of its heterologous-ly generated 6-or 7-chlorinated derivatives into pathways leading to the formation of highly valuable monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs). To provide the relevant answer, we included tdc, a gene encoding tryptophan decarboxy-lase (TDC), in our modular cloning set-up and expression approach. Analysis of extracts derived from plants expressing tdc together with either rebH or stth resulted in detection of 7-and 6-chlorotryptamine, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 3). Again, once appropriate reducing conditions were ascertained, halometabolite accumulation proved independent of subcellular context, as no differences between the cytosolic and chloroplast-derived yields were recorded. It ought to be noted that TDC was located solely in the cytosol, as its targeting to the chloroplasts had an adverse impact on plant viability (data not shown), possibly due to tryptophan depletion. However, co-expression of rebH and stth together with tdc did not lead to the formation of detectable levels of dichlorotryptamine. Results thus obtained confirmed the potential of Stth to serve as a valuable tool for the production of new-to-nature, halogenated indole alkaloids.4\u2002 \u2002 Discussion Our transient expression approach allowed us to demon-strate that the investigated tryptophan 6-halogenase, Stth was highly active in N. benthamiana and could serve as a valuable tool to efficiently generate novel metabolites in planta. Comparison with the tryptophan 7-halogenase, RebH pointed to analogous activity rates of both catalysts toward their primary amino acid substrate. The detected halometabolite signals represented the most prominent peaks in the chromatograms of the analyzed plant extracts, suggesting significant accumulation of the newly formed products. Further, the observed halotryptophan yields exceeded those of the amino acid itself, indicating no sizeable turnover or degradation of the engineered com-pounds. Thus, the factors determining the biosynthetic halotryptophan output levels seem to be the activity of involved enzymes as well as the precursor (Trp) and cofac-tor (FADH2) availability.Since flavin-dependent halogenases rely on the cata-lytic cooperation of flavin reductases, we initially used RebF from L. aerocolonigenes to determine in planta activity of Stth. The interchangeability of the augmenting enzymatic partners was previously demonstrated by Zeng and Zhan. [9]. Indeed, while sole expression of stth did not result in significant conversion of tryptophan in the cytosol, co-expression of rebF restored the activity of the enzyme, showing that flavin-dependent halogenases are promiscuous toward their partner reductase.However, most striking in our studies was the obser-vation that tryptophan halogenation took place when either RebH or Stth was translocated to the chloroplasts, even when the reductase, RebF was not co-integrated. For efficient halogenation, all relevant flavin-dependent catalysts require reduced FAD, chloride ions and oxygen as co-substrates [24]. While O2 should be present in chlo-roplasts in sufficient amounts due to photosynthetic activity and chloride levels reach up to 100\u00a0mM [25], our findings corroborated the ubiquity of FAD and its reduc-tion to diffusible FADH2 in the organelles, providing the necessary reducing capacity for halogenation reactions. Since co-localization of RebF in the chloroplasts did not yield higher amounts of chlorinated tryptophan, it can be assumed that FADH2 supply is not the rate-limiting factor of plastidal halogenation. Further, our contention is in perfect alignment with chloroplasts constituting original biosynthetic hubs of plant FAD, generated therein by virtue of monofunctional flavin synthases [26], rendering its conversion to FADH2 by reductases or other proteins involved in the electron transfer of the photosystem highly likely.Contrarily, dispensing with RebF co-incorporation in course of functionality studies of cytosolic RebH and Stth Figure\u20023.\u2002 Product formation after co-expression of halogenase/reductase construct combinations together with tryptophan decarboxylase gene (tdc). While 7-chlorotryptamine (tR, 5.07 min) and 6-chlorotryptamine (tR, 5.21 min) could be detected, no double halogenation \u00a9 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1593 www.biotecvisions.comwww.biotechnology-journal.com Biotechnology Journal Biotechnol. J. 2016, 11, 1586\u20131594abolished production of halogenated tryptophan, show-ing clearly that endogenous FADH2 supply is a chloro-plast-exclusive feature. Furthermore, no halogenase activity was detected after translocation of the investi-gated enzymes to the ER and, finally, to the apoplast. This observation could stem from the absence of tryptophan from the apoplast, demonstrated previously in four-week-old tomato plants [27]. Additionally, degradation of halo-genases by proteases located in the apoplast might account for the loss of enzymatic activity [28].Double halogenation of substrate molecules by RebH was previously observed by Payne et al. [23] in vitro assays, wherein long incubation periods facilitated binary substitution of a diverse assortment of aromatic metabo-lites. A corresponding effect was noted in case of plant-produced RebH; however, the amount of 6,7-halogenated tryptophan was significantly higher when stth was co-expressed. The considerable catalytic activity of the investigated halogenases enabled efficient bromination of tryptophan, leading to high retrieval rates of the resulting amino acid derivatives in leaves of N. benthamiana after no more than five days of incubation. Quantification of the newly formed halometabolites by integration of HPLC peak are-as, based on the analysis of serial dilutions of the relevant standard compounds, revealed that 6-bromotryptophan levels, after stth expression and KBr supplementation, were commensurate with those of concomitantly formed 6-chlorotryptophan. Moreover, upon KBr co-infiltration, RebH synthesized roughly double the amount of 7-bromo-tryptophan as compared to the 7-chlorinated amino acid derivative. According to published data, RebH bromi-nates tryptophan with a kcat value of 0.4, about three times lower than that characteristic of chlorination, indicating that bromide levels exceeded those of chloride within the cytosol post-infiltration [22]. The average chloride con-centration in the cytoplasm of higher plants ranges between 3 and 10\u00a0mM [29]. Further, anions are actively transported into the cell by anion/proton symporters while being released by passive fluxes through anion channels located in the plasma membrane [29]. The observed increased rates of bromination of tryptophan suggest active transport of bromide ions into the cyto-plasm after leaf infiltration, resulting in bromide levels that probably exceeded inherent cytosolic chloride concentra-tions, thereby promoting biosynthesis of bromotrypto-phan. In summary, characterization of bacterial tryptophan halogenases, RebH and Stth, undertaken herein unveiled various possible applications of these enzymes in facili-tating the biosynthesis of expensive and rare molecules, such as chlorotryptophan, dichloroptryptophan, chloro-tryptamine, bromotryptophan and dibromotryptophan in planta. In concert with the described transient approach-es, generation of stable transgenic tobacco plants would spur constitutive production of the aforementioned valu-able halometabolites. Moreover, target-oriented biosyn-thesis of particular compounds could be achieved through establishment of relevant cell suspension cultures. Modi-fication of culture medium composition through chloride elimination or bromide supplementation would then fos-ter the generation of one specific molecule. Additionally, including tryptophan in the culture medium might further increase yields of final products of interest. Withal, the variety of halogenated metabolites could be magnified by virtue of heterologous integration of additional regiospe-cific tryptophan halogenases. While PyrH from Strepto-myces rugosporus was shown to be functional in C.\u00a0roseus, incorporating the halo-atom at position C5 of the amino acid scaffold [13, 30], no flavin-dependent tryptophan 4-halogenase has been described to date. Lastly, combi-nation of diverse halogenases, bolstered by the catalytic activity of TDC and supplementation of bromide might facilitate the biosynthesis of a tremendous variety of mono-, di-or tri-halogenated tryptophan and tryptamine derivatives in planta, thus providing a compelling plat-form for the generation of indole-derived natural and non-natural compounds (i.a. MIAs) via metabolic engineering.The authors are grateful for the support of COST Action FA1006, PlantEngine.

        "Amid the myriad of specialized metabolites found in nature, halogenated structures constitute but a limited proportion. Nonetheless, the total number of halometabo-lites reported so far reaches almost 4000 (3700 document-ed by Gribble [1]), with the antibiotics, vancomycin [2] and chloramphenicol, or the 20S proteasome inhibitor and potential anticancer agent, salinosporamide A [3] most prominent among them. Majority of the halogenated natural compounds derive from prokaryotes or marine organisms and contain, in the main, bromine or chlorine substituents [4]. Higher plants, principal contributors to the remarkable diversity of natural products, are (so far) considered relatively devoid of halogenated structures. The very few examples of plant halometabolites include fluoracetate from Acacia georginae [5] or 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid, a halogenated auxin from pea",

        "GermanyHalogenation of natural compounds in planta is rare. Herein, a successful engineering of trypto-phan 6-halogenation into the plant context by heterologous expression of the Streptomyces toxytr-icini Stth gene and localization of its enzymatic product in various tobacco cell compartments is described. When co-expressed with the flavin reductase rebF from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes, Stth efficiently produced chlorinated tryptophan in the cytosol. Further, supplementation of KBr yielded the brominated metabolite. More strikingly, targeting of the protein to the chloroplasts enabled effective halogenation of tryptophan even in absence of the partner reductase, providing crucial evidence for sufficient, organelle-specific supply of the FADH2 cofactor to drive halogen integration.

        "1586\u20131594The importance of many halogenated products from prokaryotes and fungi lies in their often pronounced bio-logical and pharmacological effects, driving progress in the investigation of their biosynthetic pathways. Recent identification of an array of halogenating enzymes and cloning of the corresponding genes enabled thorough characterization and grouping of the catalysts into dis-tinct classes. Haloperoxidases, for example, utilize hydro-gen peroxide and halide ions to produce hypohalous acids, freely diffusible halogenating agents able to attack susceptible organic molecules. These enzymes, therefore, lack substrate specificity and regioselectivity [7]. In con-trast, the subsequently discovered class of flavin-depen-dent halogenases seems to play a vital role in the biosyn-thesis of a substantive number of natural products, with its representatives displaying high substrate specificity and/or regioselectivity [8]. In general, flavin-dependent halogenases require FADH2 to introduce a halogen atom into an organic molecule, given that the structure of the latter encompasses a double bond susceptible to electro-philic substitution [8]. Supply of the cofactor, via NADH-driven reduction of FAD, falls to a cooperating enzyme, flavin reductase. Although functionally linked, the cata-lytic partners need not derive from the same organism or biosynthetic gene cluster. As reported by Zeng and Zhan, the in vitro catalytic activity of tryptophan 6-halogenase Stth from Streptomyces toxytricini was maintained while bolstered by Fre, a flavin-reductase from E. coli, confirm-ing that a heterologous, yet similar, enzyme was sufficient to provide FADH2 and efficiently augment halogenation of tryptophan",
        "[9].The fact that many halogenating enzyme systems affording introduction of novel functionalities into ame-nable molecules are now at hand opens the possibility of combinatorial biosynthesis of new-to-nature compounds in heterologous contexts. In this light, the halogenases acting on tryptophan and its derivatives emerge as cata-lysts of considerable interest. Plants produce a plethora of tryptophan-derived metabolites, crucially exemplified by the vast array of indole alkaloids encompassing many potent pharmacological agents [10, 11]. Introduction of halides into these structures might result in altered plant products with modified activities or offer new prospects for subsequent synthetic customization steps [12]. In their ground-breaking work, the group of O\u2019Connor integrated two flavin-dependent halogenases from soil bacteria, RebH and PyrH, into the biosynthetic pathway of mono-terpenoid indole alkaloids in the medicinal plant, Cathar-anthus roseus",
        "[13].To fully capitalize on the potential of plants to provide a versatile and compelling platform for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, their inherent complexity as multicellular organisms with highly compartmentalized cells needs to be taken into account. Further, plant bio-synthetic pathways are intricate networks regulated on temporal and spatial levels [14]. Hence, consolidation of biosynthetic enzymes into novel multi-faceted metabolic circuits might require individual fine-tuning of their local-ization within a plant cell. Consequently, metabolic engi-neering endeavors call for in-depth investigation of high numbers of permutations of combined genes, targeting sequences and promoters to establish the optimal context for production of the desired molecule(s). In recent years, modular cloning technologies for metabolic engineering, enabling fast and reliable assembly of multiple expression constructs from a limited set of standardized building blocks, have been proposed [15]. Among them, the inter-compatible GoldenBraid (GB) and MoClo standards proved especially useful in plant synthetic biology approaches, spurring the development of effective pro-moter shuffling strategies [16] and CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing tools [17] facilitating designer transcrip-tional regulation as well as helping to tackle the intrica-cies of plastome engineering",
        "[18].In the present study, we set out to expand the reper-toire of tryptophan halogenases amenable for plant syn-thetic biology-driven redesign. To this end, we elected to examine the engineering potential of the aforementioned, recently discovered tryptophan 6-halogenase from S. toxytricini, Stth [9]. To further expand the characteriza-tion of catalytic properties of the enzyme, we introduced it into the GoldenBraid context and investigated the effect of divergent subcellular localization on product for-mation. We further addressed the ability of Stth to provide precursors for monoterpenoid indole alkaloid formation in a combinatorial biosynthetic",

Their capacity to introduce a second chloride atom to the chlo-rinated amino acid molecule was investigated by tran-sient co-transformation of N. benthamiana with rebH and stth. To evaluate the biosynthesis of dichlorotryptophan in the cytosol, both halogenases were co-localized with the partner reductase, RebF. Additionally, tandem halo-genation in chloroplasts was analyzed without RebF. Besides the formation of 6-and 7-chlorotryptophan, co-localization of Stth and RebH correlated with accumula-tion of a third metabolite, eluting after 10.36\u00a0min in HPLC analyses (Fig.\u00a02F). Further LC-MS investigation revealed an m/z value of 273 in positive ionization mode, while the relevant isotope pattern gave proof of effective dichloro-tryptophan biosynthesis in planta (Supporting informa-tion, Fig.\u00a0S9). Interestingly, trace amounts of the molecule were also detectable in control samples representative of RebH alone, suggesting that the enzyme exhibits residu-al activity toward 6-halogenation and is, to some extent, capable of producing dichlorotryptophan [23]. This became evident upon analysis by UPLC-MS (Supporting informa-tion, Fig.\u00a0S10). While Stth produced solely 6-chlorotrypto-phan, RebH-containing plants accumulated 6,7-dichloro-tryptophan as",
        "well.The tandem activity of RebH and Stth was also exam-ined after co-transformation of both relevant gene con-structs and subsequent infiltration of 40\u00a0mM KBr. Com-pared to negative control samples, co-expression of rebH and stth correlated with the formation of a novel metabo-lite that eluted after 5.97\u00a0min and revealed m/z values of 361, 363 and 365 with signal intensity ratios of 1:2:1, compatible with a di-brominated tryptophan molecule (Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S11). Moreover, an alterna-tive metabolite exhibiting a tR value of 5.83\u00a0min and m/z values of 317, 319 and 321 was observed (Supporting information, Fig.\u00a0S11). According to the detected mass and the characteristic mass spectrum, this molecule was, most likely, that of a mono-chlorinated and mono-bromi-nated",

        "Tryptophan is a vital precursor driving biosynthesis of numerous specialized plant metabolites. We, therefore, addressed the question of integration of its heterologous-ly generated 6-or 7-chlorinated derivatives into pathways leading to the formation of highly valuable monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs). To provide the relevant answer, we included tdc, a gene encoding tryptophan decarboxy-lase (TDC), in our modular cloning set-up and expression approach. Analysis of extracts derived from plants expressing tdc together with either rebH or stth resulted in detection of 7-and 6-chlorotryptamine, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 3). Again, once appropriate reducing conditions were ascertained, halometabolite accumulation proved independent of subcellular context, as no differences between the cytosolic and chloroplast-derived yields were recorded. It ought to be noted that TDC was located solely in the cytosol, as its targeting to the chloroplasts had an adverse impact on plant viability (data not shown), possibly due to tryptophan depletion. However, co-expression of rebH and stth together with tdc did not lead to the formation of detectable levels of dichlorotryptamine. Results thus obtained confirmed the potential of Stth to serve as a valuable tool for the production of new-to-nature, halogenated indole",
        "alkaloids.4\u2002 \u2002 Discussion",
        "Our transient expression approach allowed us to demon-strate that the investigated tryptophan 6-halogenase, Stth was highly active in N. benthamiana and could serve as a valuable tool to efficiently generate novel metabolites in planta. Comparison with the tryptophan 7-halogenase, RebH pointed to analogous activity rates of both catalysts toward their primary amino acid substrate. The detected halometabolite signals represented the most prominent peaks in the chromatograms of the analyzed plant extracts, suggesting significant accumulation of the newly formed products. Further, the observed halotryptophan yields exceeded those of the amino acid itself, indicating no sizeable turnover or degradation of the engineered com-pounds. Thus, the factors determining the biosynthetic halotryptophan output levels seem to be the activity of involved enzymes as well as the precursor (Trp) and cofac-tor (FADH2)",
        "availability.Since flavin-dependent halogenases rely on the cata-lytic cooperation of flavin reductases, we initially used RebF from L. aerocolonigenes to determine in planta activity of Stth. The interchangeability of the augmenting enzymatic partners was previously demonstrated by Zeng and Zhan. [9]. Indeed, while sole expression of stth did not result in significant conversion of tryptophan in the cytosol, co-expression of rebF restored the activity of the enzyme, showing that flavin-dependent halogenases are promiscuous toward their partner",
        "reductase.However, most striking in our studies was the obser-vation that tryptophan halogenation took place when either RebH or Stth was translocated to the chloroplasts, even when the reductase, RebF was not co-integrated. For efficient halogenation, all relevant flavin-dependent catalysts require reduced FAD, chloride ions and oxygen as co-substrates [24]. While O2 should be present in chlo-roplasts in sufficient amounts due to photosynthetic activity and chloride levels reach up to 100\u00a0mM [25], our findings corroborated the ubiquity of FAD and its reduc-tion to diffusible FADH2 in the organelles, providing the necessary reducing capacity for halogenation reactions. Since co-localization of RebF in the chloroplasts did not yield higher amounts of chlorinated tryptophan, it can be assumed that FADH2 supply is not the rate-limiting factor of plastidal halogenation. Further, our contention is in perfect alignment with chloroplasts constituting original biosynthetic hubs of plant FAD, generated therein by virtue of monofunctional flavin synthases [26], rendering its conversion to FADH2 by reductases or other proteins involved in the electron transfer of the photosystem highly",

Furthermore, no halogenase activity was detected after translocation of the investi-gated enzymes to the ER and, finally, to the apoplast. This observation could stem from the absence of tryptophan from the apoplast, demonstrated previously in four-week-old tomato plants [27]. Additionally, degradation of halo-genases by proteases located in the apoplast might account for the loss of enzymatic activity",
        "[28].Double halogenation of substrate molecules by RebH was previously observed by Payne et al. [23] in vitro assays, wherein long incubation periods facilitated binary substitution of a diverse assortment of aromatic metabo-lites. A corresponding effect was noted in case of plant-produced RebH; however, the amount of 6,7-halogenated tryptophan was significantly higher when stth was co-expressed.",
        "The considerable catalytic activity of the investigated halogenases enabled efficient bromination of tryptophan, leading to high retrieval rates of the resulting amino acid derivatives in leaves of N. benthamiana after no more than five days of incubation. Quantification of the newly formed halometabolites by integration of HPLC peak are-as, based on the analysis of serial dilutions of the relevant standard compounds, revealed that 6-bromotryptophan levels, after stth expression and KBr supplementation, were commensurate with those of concomitantly formed 6-chlorotryptophan. Moreover, upon KBr co-infiltration, RebH synthesized roughly double the amount of 7-bromo-tryptophan as compared to the 7-chlorinated amino acid derivative. According to published data, RebH bromi-nates tryptophan with a kcat value of 0.4, about three times lower than that characteristic of chlorination, indicating that bromide levels exceeded those of chloride within the cytosol post-infiltration [22]. The average chloride con-centration in the cytoplasm of higher plants ranges between 3 and 10\u00a0mM [29]. Further, anions are actively transported into the cell by anion/proton symporters while being released by passive fluxes through anion channels located in the plasma membrane [29]. The observed increased rates of bromination of tryptophan suggest active transport of bromide ions into the cyto-plasm after leaf infiltration, resulting in bromide levels that probably exceeded inherent cytosolic chloride concentra-tions, thereby promoting biosynthesis of bromotrypto-phan.",
        "In summary, characterization of bacterial tryptophan halogenases, RebH and Stth, undertaken herein unveiled various possible applications of these enzymes in facili-tating the biosynthesis of expensive and rare molecules, such as chlorotryptophan, dichloroptryptophan, chloro-tryptamine, bromotryptophan and dibromotryptophan in planta. In concert with the described transient approach-es, generation of stable transgenic tobacco plants would spur constitutive production of the aforementioned valu-able halometabolites. Moreover, target-oriented biosyn-thesis of particular compounds could be achieved through establishment of relevant cell suspension cultures. Modi-fication of culture medium composition through chloride elimination or bromide supplementation would then fos-ter the generation of one specific molecule. Additionally, including tryptophan in the culture medium might further increase yields of final products of interest. Withal, the variety of halogenated metabolites could be magnified by virtue of heterologous integration of additional regiospe-cific tryptophan halogenases. While PyrH from Strepto-myces rugosporus was shown to be functional in C.\u00a0roseus, incorporating the halo-atom at position C5 of the amino acid scaffold [13, 30], no flavin-dependent tryptophan 4-halogenase has been described to date. Lastly, combi-nation of diverse halogenases, bolstered by the catalytic activity of TDC and supplementation of bromide might facilitate the biosynthesis of a tremendous variety of mono-, di-or tri-halogenated tryptophan and tryptamine derivatives in planta, thus providing a compelling plat-form for the generation of indole-derived natural and non-natural compounds (i.a. MIAs) via metabolic",
